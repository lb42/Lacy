R. </span></h2><p>— passed a considerable portion of his early life in India, of which country he has published some interesting reminiscences. Colonel Addison began writing for the stage in 1830, when he supplied Mrs. Waylett with a number of light pieces, that attained at the time considerable popularity. In 1834 he wrote <span class="titlem">Tam o' Shanter</span> and <span class="titlem">The King's Seal</span>, produced with marked success at Drury Lane, and the drama of <span class="titlem">Lo Zingaro, </span>brought out at the Adelphi. Of late years Colonel Addison has devoted himself more assiduously to other forms of literature, and during the time of the French Exhibition of 1867 he was retained as special correspondent of one of the most influential London newspapers, for which responsible post his intimate knowledge of Parisian life, and his fluent style of writing, endowed him with peculiar advantages. Colonel Addison has written about sixty pieces for the London theatres, many of them <span class="foreign">apropos</span> farces, most successfully illustrating the popular topic of the time.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA102"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1.2. </span><span class="head">BERNARD, WILLIAM BAYLE </span></h2><p>— son of an eminent English comedian and manager, was born in Pleasant-street, Boston, U.S., next door to the old house of Dr. Franklin, on tho 27th of November, 1809, during his father’s management of the Boston Theatre, and when he was on the eve of opening that of Albany and of Quebec and Montreal. Mr. Bayle Bernard came to England with his family in 1820, and finished his education at what was then called a “Latin Grammar Academy” at Uxbridge, an old proprietary school, kept by a Dissenting minister, Dr. Beaseley. He went to Boulogne with his family in 1823, and there at 16 commenced his literary labours as amanuensis to Charles Barthelemy, the son of the author of “The Travels of Anacharsis," who wrote a history of Boulogne in French, which the young assistant translated into English. In 1826 he obtained a clerkship in the “Army Accounts Office,” through the interest of Mr. Canning, whose mother had been his father’s leading tragedienne at Plymouth, an office that unluckily was soon after abolished by the Duke of Wellington. In 1827 he produced his first drama, which was at the old Olympic Theatre, when under tho management of Mr. Scott, the first manager of the Adelphi. This was a nautical piece, after the fashion of <span class="titlem">The Pilot</span>, and entitled, <span class="titlem">Casco Bag</span>, for which he was paid the sum of <em>three pounds,</em> and on the 100th night of its run (it reached 140) he received two pounds more, to prompt him to further exertions. In 1828 he produced his first novel, “The Freebooter’s Bride,” in five volumes, one of the thousand publications of the old “Minerva Press,” which prolonged the school of Mrs. Radcliffe till it slowly died out at the hands of Ann of Swansea, Francis Lathom, and others. In 1829 he wrote from memoranda which had been left by his father his “Retrospections of the Stage," and joined the metropolitan press, writing for tho “Morning Post” and other papers on social and literary topics.</p><p>In 1830 he commenced his toils as a professed dramatist, under the theatrical triumvirate of Lee, Melrose, and Chapman, at the Tottenham-street Theatre, producing a drama called <span class="titlem">The Metempsychosis</span>, and a number of farces. In 1831 he wrote for the Strand Theatre, on its opening under Lee and Rayner, <span class="titlem">The Four Sisters</span>, and other pieces for Mrs. Waylett. In 1832 he wrote, for Madame Vestris at the Olympic, <span class="titlem">The Dumb Belle, </span> and other pieces, and also furnished the drama of <span class="titlem">Rip van Winkle</span> to the Adelphi. In 1833 Mr. Bayle Bernard wrote several American dramas for Mr, Hackett, the chief of which were—<span class="titlem">The Kentuckian</span>, produced that year at Covent Garden, and a new version of <span class="titlem">Rip van Winkle</span>, which was acted at the Haymarket; together with <span class="titlem">The Mummy</span>, for the English Opera House, and <span class="titlem">The Nervous Man</span>, for Drury Lane. In 1836 he produced <span class="titlem">Lucille</span> at the Lyceum, which was followed by <span class="titlem">The Parmer's Story, the Middy Ashore</span>, and <span class="titlem">The Man about Town;</span> and the same year he wrote some American farces for Mr. Hill, the comedian, the chief of which was <span class="titlem">The Yankee Pedlar</span>, which was brought out at Drury Lane. In 1837 he furnished Madame Celeste with <span class="titlem">St. Mary's Eve, </span>which was produced at the Adelphi, and was followed by <span class="titlem">Marie Ducange</span>, played at the Haymarket; and in 1839 he wrote for Mr. Power <span class="titlem">His Last Legs</span> and <span class="titlem">The Irish Attorney</span>, which were acted at the same theatre. In 1841 <span class="titlem">The Boarding School</span>, and in 1846 <span class="titlem">The Bound of Wrong</span>, were performed at the Haymarket; in 1845 the drama of <span class="titlem">Blanche de Valmy</span>, at the Princess's Theatre; and in 1848 the play of <span class="titlem">The Passing Cloud</span>, at Drury Lane. In 1854 and 1856 he wrote for the Haymarket <span class="titlem">The Balance oj Comfort</span> and the comedy of <span class="titlem">The Evil Genius</span>, followed by that of <span class="titlem">The Tide of Titne</span>, and the drama of <span class="titlem">A Life's Trial.</span> In 1857 Mr. Bernard became the theatrical critic of the “Weekly Dispatch,” and after an eight years’ cessation from his dramatic labours he returned to them in 1866, furnishing the adaptation of <span class="titlem">Faust</span> to Drury Lane. He has written besides a couple of novels, a mass of magazine matter, and contributions of all kinds to the metropolitan press ; whilst in respect to his dramas, many of which were written for America, and not half of them published, we may mention that his last production, <span class="titlem">The Doge of Fenice</span>, forms the 114th!</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA103"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1.3. </span><span class="head">BLANCHARD, EDWARD L. </span></h2><p>— born in London, December 11th, 1820, is the son of William Blanchard, the comedian, who for thirty-five years was a distinguished member of Covent Garden Theatre, under the managemeut of the Kembles and their successors. On the decease of his father, in 1835, Mr. E. L. Blanchard became associated with literary pursuits, and from that time he has been an industrious contributor to newspapers and periodicals. In his seventeenth year he began writing for the stage, and some thirty dramas and farces produced before he was twenty, attest at least the fertility of a youthful imagination. In 1841 he was retained as the stock dramatist of the Olympic Theatre, where, among many other pieces, the farces of <span class="titlem">Angels and Lucifers, The Artful Dodge, Pork Chops</span>, and the drama of <span class="titlem">The Road of Life</span>, were peculiarly successful. Newspaper engagements appear to have soon after diverted the exercise of his pen in another direction, but besides supplying Mr. W. S. Woodin with “The Carpet Bag,” and a series of similar protean entertainments, and furnishing Miss Emma Stanley with her popular “Seven Ages of Woman,” Mr. E. L. Blanchard has contrived to illustrate the whole range of fairy mythology in a series of Christmas extravaganzas, which number nearly one hundred. As a somewhat remarkable circumstance in the career of a dramatic author, it may be recorded that he never adapted a piece from the French, and never dramatised a novel. A succession of pantomimes produced under the pseudonym of <span class="titlem">Francisco Frost</span> gave him in early life a reputation for these eccentricities of authorship, and for the last seventeen years Mr. E. L. Blanchard has publicly identified his name with the Drury lane comic annuals.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA104"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1.4. </span><span class="head">BOUCICAULT, Dion </span></h2><p>— was born in Dublin, December 26th, 1820, and was educated under the care of his guardian, Dr. Lardner, and at the London University. After some slighter experiments in dramatic literature ho established his name by the production of <span class="titlem">London Assurance</span> at Covent Garden Theatre, March 4th, 1841, and this notable success was speedily followed by the comedies and dramas of <span class="titlem">The Irish Heiress, Alma Mater, Old Heads and Young Hearts, Lone in a Mase, Used Up, The Willow Copse, Janet Pride, Louis the Eleventh, The Corsican Brothers, The Vampire</span>, and <span class="titlem">Faust and Marguerite</span>, furnished to the Haymarket, the Adelphi, and the Princess’s Theatres. In January, 1853, Mr. Boucicault married Miss Agnes Robertson, then an esteemed member of Mr. Charles Kean’s company at the Princess’s Theatre, and soon after went to America, appearing with his clever wife at Burton’s Chambers-street Theatre. At the opening of the Winter Garden Theatre, New York, for the season of 1859—1860, Mr. Boucicault was engaged as dramatist to the establishment. On the 18th of July, 1860, Mr. and Mrs. Boucicault returned to England and appeared at the Adelphi Theatre (September 10th) in <span class="titlem">The Colleen Bawn</span>, which achieved such remarkable popularity. <span class="titlem">The Colleen Baton</span> attained its 231st representation on its first uninterrupted run, but it was played for many nights after at the Adelphi, in conjunction with <span class="titlem">The Octoroon.</span> Mr. Boucicault is the author of about 150 dramas, in all of which he has displayed considerable literary power, associated with remarkable constructive skill. Among the most prominent of Mr. Boucicault's dramas produced since <span class="titlem">The Colleen Bawn</span> may be mentioned <span class="titlem">The Fox Chase</span>, a five-act comedy (St. James’s, May 11th, 1864) j <span class="titlem">The Streets of London</span>, drama (Princess’s, August 1st, 1864) <span class="titlem">Omoo ; or. The Sea of Ice</span>, drama (Royal Amphitheatre, Liverpool, Oc*. 30th, 1864); <span class="titlem">Arrah na Pogue; or, The Wicklow Wedding</span>, four acts (originally brought out at the Theatre Royal, Dublin, and produced at the Princess's, March 22d, 1865); <span class="titlem">The Long Strike</span>, four-act drama (Lyceum, September 15th, 1866); <span class="titlem">Flying Scud</span>, four-act drama (New Holborn Theatre, October 6tb, 1866); and <span class="titlem">Hunted Down; or, The Two Lives of Mary Leigh</span>, three-act drama (St. James’s Theatre, November 5th, 1866).</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA105"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1.5. </span><span class="head">BROOKS, SHIRLEY.</span></h2><p>—This brilliant and versatile writer was born April 29th, 1816, and originally intended for the law, but preferred literature. During the Keeley management of the Lyceum (1844—1847), Mr. Shirley Brooks produced <span class="titlem">Our New Governess, </span>a clever two-act comedy ; <span class="titlem">Honours and Tricks</span>, a witty and well-constructed comedy in three acts; and the drama of <span class="titlem">The Creole</span>, a piece of strong interest, based on a story of slavery in Mauritius. As a journalist, novelist, and most important contributor to “ Punch,” Mr. Shirley Brooks has apparently had no leisure lately to extend his fame as a dramatist, for which his keen perception of character and power of writing humorous dialogue so pre-eminently qualify him.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA106"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1.6. </span><span class="head">BROUGH, WILLIAM </span></h2><p>— was born in London on the 28th April, 1826. His first appearance as a dramatic author was in the early part of the year 1848, when, in conjunction with his late brother Robert, he brought out the <span class="titlem">Enchanted Isle</span> at the Amphitheatre, Liverpool, then under the management of Mr. W. R. Copeland, recently deceased. It happened that Mr. Benjamin Webster, manager of the Adelphi Theatre, London, visited Liverpool at the time, and saw the <span class="titlem">Enchanted Isle</span> there. He at once entered into negotiations for its reproduction upon the Adelphi boards, where it was brought out November 20,1848. The great success of this, their first attempt, at once established the “Brothers Brough ” as comic dramatists in London, and for some years they wrote the Christmas and Easter pieces not only for the Adelphi but likewise for the Haymarket, that theatre being at the time also under Mr. Webster’s management, The "Brothers," however, dissolved their literary partnership, and we find the subject of our memoir first appearing single-handed as an author of original fairy extravaganza on the stage of the Lyceum (under Madame Vestris's management) at Christmas, 1854. We need not follow Mr. William Brough step by step, nor indeed would our space permit our giving here a list of his productions were we so inclined. Enough to say he has achieved dramatic successes upon nearly every important London stage. He also wrote the first of those “ Entertainments " with which Mr. and Mrs. German Reed have so long charmed the town; and many others of the series, since the first, have also been written for Mr. and Mrs. Reed and Mr. John Parry from time to time by William Brough. Early in the year 1851, Mr. William Brough married Miss Anne Romer, the celebrated English Opera <span class="titlem">prima donna.</span> The lady, however, did not long enjoy her married happiness, but died directly after the birth of her first child. Mr. Brough has since married again, his present wife being entirely unconnected with the dramatic profession.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA107"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1.7. </span><span class="head">BROUGHAM, JOHN </span></h2><p>— born in Dublin, May 9,1814, was educated at the Preparatory Collegiate Institute of the Rev. Dean Hamilton, and passed his examination at Trinity College, Dublin. Mr. John Brougham was originally intended for the medical profession, but his tastes led him to the stage, and he made his first appearance at the Tottenham- street Theatre, London (now the Prince of Wales’s), in July, 1830, sustaining the several parts of a countryman, costermonger, sweep, gentleman, sailor, and jockey—the whole in one night—in <span class="titlem">Tom and Jerry.</span> When Madame Vestris took the Olympic he became a member of her company, and was the stock Irishman of that theatre. In 1840 he became lessee of the Lyceum Theatre, where he first appeared as an author, producing a lively mythological extravaganza called <span class="titlem">Life in the Clouds.</span> In 1842 he sailed for America, and made his <span class="foreign">debut</span> at the Park Theatre, New York, as Tun Moore in <span class="titlem">The Irish Lion.</span> On the 15th of October, 1850, he opened the new theatre on Broadway called Brougham’8 Lyceum (afterwards “ Wallack's Theatre ”), and then took a lease of the Old Bowery for a short time, opening there July 7, 1856. In September, 1860, Mr. Brougham returned to England, and appeared at the Lyceum under Mr. Fechter's management, which he had already aided by his skilful adaptation of <span class="titlem">The Duke's Motto.</span> His comedy of <span class="titlem">Playing with Fire</span>. brought out at the Princess's, is a favourable example of his powers as a | dramatist. With a thorough knowledge of stage effect, his dialogue is distinguished by a vein of rich humour, and occasionally by deep pathos. In 1866 Mr. Brougham returned to the United States, where, as in this country, ho is personally as well as professionally held in the highest estimation.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA108"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1.8. </span><span class="head">BUCKSTONE, John Baldwin </span></h2><p>— born near London in 1802, and having acquired popularity as an actor at the Surrey Theatre, turned his attention to dramatic writing at i the Adelphi, where he produced in 1828 his interesting drama of <span class="titlem">Luke the Labourer</span>, and appeared as Bobby Trot.

To the fertility of Mr. Byron’s pen the town is indebted for a long series of those most amusing burlesques which date from the first season of Miss Swanborough at the Strand, in 1858. His comedies of <span class="titlem">War to the Knife</span> and <span class="titlem">A Hundred Thousand Pounds</span>, produced at the Prince of Wales's Theatre, 1865 and 1866, show the possession of talents of a far higher order, and his novels have attained a wide and deserved popularity. To give a list of Mr. Byron’s burlesques would be impossible within reasonable limits, but nearly every theatre in London has profited by their production. Since the autumn of 1866 Mr. Byron has undertaken the management of the Theatre Royal, and the Amphitheatre, Liverpool, where he produced, in November, 1867, a <span class="titlem">very</span> effective drama of the sensation kind, under the title of <span class="titlem">The Lancashire Lass.</span></p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA111"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1.11. </span><span class="head">CARPENTER, Joseph Edwards </span></h2><p>— born in London, November 2,1813, though chiefly known as a song-writer and lecturer, has contributed successfully to the stage.

Encouraged by success in his literary pursuits he finally adopted journalism as his vocation in 1857, and in the following year was engaged on the “Leader,” writing for a considerable period the weekly political and general summary. In 1860 he was appointed general manager of the “Spectator,” and in 1861 became general manager and fine art critic of the “Morning Chronicle.” Afterwards was theatrical critic of the “Reader " from April, 1863, to the autumn of 1864, when that paper ceased to be edited by Professor Masson.

In 1837 Mr. Stirling Coyne brought out at the Adelphi a capital farce called <span class="titlem">The Queer Subjeet</span>, in which Mr. John Reeve played the principal part, and from that time ho settled in England and became rapidly acknowledged as a dramatist of increasing repute. The dramatic works of an author who has furnished such a number of pieces supplied to all the principal theatres of London, but chiefly the Haymarket and the Adelphi, can only be here briefly indicated. Among Mr. Coyne’s most popular comedies may be mentioned <span class="titlem">Presented at Court, The Hope of the Family, The Secret Agent, Man of Many Friends</span>, and <span class="titlem">Black Sheep.</span> His admirable farce, <span class="titlem">How to Settle Accounts with your Laundress, </span>has been translated both into French and German.

After numerous other provincial removes Mr. Craven appeared as a youthful tragedian at Drury Lane (1850), playing Orlando to the Rosalind of Mrs. Nesbitt, Azel, &amp;c. The following year he wrote and performed in a very successful operetta produced at the Strand called <span class="titlem">The Village Nightingale</span>, in which the heroine was represented by Miss Eliza Nelson, a daughter of the composer. This lady, in May, 1852, became Mrs. Craven, and they resolved to try their united fortunes in Australia, where they arrived in October, 1854. After a professional visit to New Zealand in 1856, Mr. Craven returned to Sydney and became a partner in the Lyceum Theatre, but disposing of his interest in the property he returned, after visiting Melbourne and the Gold Fields, to England, where he appeared as a light comedian at the St. James’s Theatre in 1859. In 1860 he retired from the stage, but the death of Mr. Robson, for whom he had prepared the character of “Milky White,” induced him to accept an engagement at the Strand Theatre in 1864 to realize his own conception of the eccentric milkman. As an author Mr. H. T. Craven has been distinguished by his originality, his pieces being to all intents creations.

Mr. Falconer’s first drama of any pretension, brought out in London, was a five-act play called <span class="titlem">The Cagot, or </span><span class="titlem">Heart </span><span class="titlem">for Heart</span>, produced at the Lyceum under Mr. Charles Dillon’s manageraent in November, 1856.

His mother’s maiden name was Fitz, and this he added in the course of his career as a dramatic author to his original patronymic of Ball. Family misfortunes deprived him of the prospect of an inheritance, and he entered a printing-office at an early age, during which time he formed a happy matrimonial alliance. After a vain attempt to establish a printing-office of his own at Norwich, and with greater effect having produced a drama on the boards of the Norwich Theatre, he came to London, where he commenced writing for the stage, encouraged by the success of a melodrama called <span class="titlem">Edda</span> which he had sent to the Surrey Theatre, then under the management of Tom Dibdin. Then followed <span class="titlem">The Innkeeper of Abbeville, The </span><span class="titlem">Floating Beacon, The Inchcape Bell, The Flying Dutchman, The Pilot</span>, and a number of dramas - which have maintained their position on the stage. As a librettist Mr. Fitzball has been remarkably successful, and most of our popular composers have in that capacity been glad to engage his services.

When Ramo Samee appeared at the old Coburg before the glass curtain Mr. Nelson Lee was so delighted with the juggler’s tricks that he strove hard to rival him, and at last acquired such proficiency that he was enabled to join the great conjuror Gyngell, and perform through England all the balancing and juggling of the nimble-handed Indian. Richardson’s Show was then the great attraction of our country fairs, and Mr. Nelson Lee became a member of the celebrated itinerant company. Afterwards he gave entertainments on his own account, and in 1828 he played Harlequin in the Christmas Pantomime at the Surrey Theatre, where he was engaged by Elliston for general utility. For seven years he remained at this theatre, and then Yates engaged him for the Adelphi, where in 1831 he played Harlequin in a pantomime of his own writing. In 1837 he managed Sadler’s Wells for Mr. Osbaldiston, and this giving him a taste for theatrical speculations he joined the late Mr. Johnson, and they became the proprietors of Richardson’s Travelling Theatre, whilst for a season they tried their fortunes also at the Marylebone.

His five-act play of <span class="titlem">The Patrician's Daughter</span>, brought out by Mr. Macready, at Drury Lane (December 10th, 1842), first gained him an acknowledged position as a dramatic poet. <span class="titlem">The </span><span class="titlem">Heart and the World, </span>a play ; <span class="titlem">Strathmore</span>, a tragedy; <span class="titlem">Philip of France</span>, a tragedy; <span class="titlem">Ann Blake</span>, a play; <span class="titlem">A Life's Ransom</span>, a play ; and a one-act drama, called <span class="titlem">A Hard Struggle</span>, followed.

Originally intended for the Church, and eventually brought up as an architect, Mr. C. J. Mathews ultimately adopted the stage as a profession, appearing for the first time in public at the Olympic Theatre, Dec. 7th, 1835. His career as an actor has been a series of successes in every character he has undertaken, but it does not fall within the scope of this article to follow him through the long list of his histrionic triumphs. Mr. Charles Mathews is the author of numerous amusing pieces which have attained great popularity. <span class="titlem">My Wife's Mother</span>, first played at the Haymarket, in 1833, and a romantic drama, called <span class="titlem">Truth; or, A Glass too Much</span>, brought out at the Adelphi, with a remarkably strong cast, March 10th, 1834, were the earliest of his contributions to the stage. Mr. C. J. Mathews has neatly adapted some of the most sparkling pieces of the Parisian dramatists to the English boards, and his clever adaptation of Foote’s comedy of <span class="titlem">The Liar</span> (Olympic, 1867), which ran upwards of 100 nights, attests the practical skill of a dramatist who is unrivalled as a comedian.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA127"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1.27. </span><span class="head">MAYHEW, Henry</span></h2><p>born in 1812, and educated at Westminster School, took a voyage to Calcutta, and on his return was articled for three years to his father, a solicitor in large practice.

His earliest farces were, <span class="titlem">My Fellow Clerk, </span><span class="titlem">I and my Double</span>, and <span class="titlem">A Dag Well Spent</span>, brought out nt the Lyceum, in 1835, and since that period Mr. Oxenford has contributed about eighty pieces to the principal metropolitan theatres. There are few dramatists who have so cleverly adapted French subjects to the English stage, and amongst many others <span class="titlem">The Porter's Knot</span> may be cited as a notable example of skilful manipulation in this respect. One of the best of his early original productions, <span class="titlem">Twice </span><span class="titlem">Killed</span>, has been played both as a drama and as an opera, in various languages. Mr. Oxenford is a scholar of the very highest attainments, and is justly recognised as the best dramatic critic of his time. Besides having enriched the literature of this country with numerous works displaying great research, and an intimate knowledge of German, Spanish, and Italian authors, Mr. Oxenford is a singularly fluent and graceful lyrical writer, and numerous songs and operatic <span class="titlem">libretti</span> attest the fertility of his fancy, and the extreme polish of his versification. In the autumn of 1867 Mr. Oxenford visited New York, the dramatic amusements of which city he described in * series of graphic articles contributed to the “Times.”</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA130"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1.30. </span><span class="head">PHILLIPS, Watts </span></h2><p>— born in London towards the close of 1829. Mr. Watts Phillipa was brought up as an artist, and after being the only pupil of George Cruikshank, was a student in Paris for many years. While residing in London was connected with several comic periodicals. When engaged upon “Diogenes” wrote, under the signature of “The Ragged Philosopher,” a series of papers, entitled “Thoughts in Tatters,” also another series of articles, called “The Wild Tribes of London.” From this time Mr. Watts Phillips almost entirely dropped the pencil for the pen. An accident placed his first drama of <span class="titlem">Joseph </span><span class="titlem">Chavigny</span> in the hands of Mr. Benjamin Webster, who immediately purchased the piece, and produced it at the Adelphi Theatre, in May, 1856. This drama was quickly followed by <span class="titlem">The Poor Strollers, </span><span class="titlem">The Dead </span><span class="titlem">Heart</span>, and the comedy of <span class="titlem">Paper </span><span class="titlem">Wings.</span> After the great success of <span class="titlem">The Dead Heart</span>, Mr. Watts Phillips was <span class="titlem">specially </span>engaged to write for Mr. Webster, and several unacted dramas and farces, written at that period, are still in that gentleman’s possession. Mr. Phillips again appeared before the public at Drury Lane in the drama of <span class="titlem">A Story of the Forty-five</span>, in which Mr. Webster sustained the principal r61e.

In 1854 Mr. Planch was created Rouge Croix Pursuivant at Arms in connexion with the Herald's College.

In early years he was destined for the Church, was entered at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and at that University took his Bachelor’s, and subsequently his Master’s, degree. He never, however, accepted the vocation for which he was intended, and for many years was a traveller on the Continent, residing at different foreign courts, and flitting from one country to another without occupation. The failure of a bank, by which he suddenly found himself deprived of his fortune,SIM aroused him to adopt literature as a profession. He soon became a constant contributor to Blackwood’s, Fraser’s, and Bentley’s Magazines, wrote tales and novels, and other miscellaneous works, the most notable of which were his “.Letters from the Danube” and “Pictures from Revolutionary Paris.” An intense love of the stage afterwards urged him to try his fortune at the theatres. His first effort was a' little drama, called <span class="titlem">Poor Cousin Walter</span>, produced at the Strand Theatre, then under the management of the late Mr. William Farren, on the 8th of April, 1850, with Mrs. Stirling and Mr. Leigh Murray in its principal characters. His success on this occasion induced him to add further dramatic efforts to his other literary occupations. Since that time he lias been one of the most prolific of our dramatic authors, and his productions have been played at almost every West-end theatre in London.

His first piece was <span class="titlem">A Trip to Kissengea</span>, produced at the Lyceum (1846) and among his numerous popular pieces may be cited, <span class="titlem">Still Waters Run Deep</span> (Olympic, May 14th, 1855) ; <span class="titlem">An Unequal Match</span> (Haymarket, Nov. 7th, 1857) ; <span class="titlem">The Fool's Revenge</span> (Sadler’s Wells, Oct. 18th, 1859) ; <span class="titlem">The Overland Route</span> (Haymarket, Feb. 23d, 1860); and <span class="titlem">The Ticket-of- Leave Man</span> (Olympic, May 27th, 1863), which was represented uninterruptedly for 406 nights. Mr. Tom Taylor, who is the author of nearly 100 pieces, has since produced <span class="titlem">Settling Day</span>, a comedy (Olympic, March 4th, 1865); <span class="titlem">Henry Dunbar</span> (Olympic, Dec. 9th, 1865) ; and <span class="titlem">A Sister's Penance</span>, in conjunction with Mr. A. W. Dubourg (Adelphi, Nov. 26th, 1866). It may here be convenient to record that Mr. Tom Taylor’s drama of <span class="titlem">Our American Cousin</span>, through the great success of Mr. Sothern’s impersonation of Lord Dundreary, has had the longest run ever known. After being played in America over 800 nights, it was brought out at the Haymarket Theatre (11th of November, 1861), where, after being represented thirty-five times, it was unavoidably withdrawn in consequence of previous engagements. It was reproduced on the 27th of January, 1862, and it then reached, without further interruption, its 496th representation. In the autumn of 1867 the piece was again revived on the return to the Haymarket of Mr. Sothern, who had acted Lord Dundreary in Paris through the summer.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA141"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1.41. </span><span class="head">WEBSTER, Benjamin </span></h2><p>— born at Bath, September 3d, 1793, was educated for the Navy, but in preference to a sailor’s life he first preferred that of a musician, and afterwards that of an actor, frequently in his early career combining both pursuits, and times appearing as a dancer. His success on the stage of the Warwick Theatre induced him to come to London, where he appeared at several of the smaller theatres with great credit in slight parts. In 1825 be became a member of the Drury Lane company, and soon after this period prepared some pieces for the Coburg and the Surrey. Since the production of <span class="titlem">The Golden Farmer</span> at- the Coburg (Dec. 26th, 1832), Mr. Benjamin Webster has greatly distinguished himself as a dramatic author, and numerous dramas and light pieces, many of them founded on French plots, attest his literary ability and perfect command of the resources of the stage. Mr. Benjamin Webster, jun., has also adapted, with considerable tact, several pieces from the French stage successfully produced at the Adelphi.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA142"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1.42. </span><span class="head">WIGAN, ALFRED </span></h2><p>— born at Blackheath, Kent, on the 24th of March, 1818, is not only known as an excellent actor and an honourable manager, but as a successful dramatic author. He opened the Olympic Theatre, Oct. 17, 1853, and after four years of management retired from the stage on account of ill-health in July, 1857. Subsequently he resumed his professional engagements, and on the 29th of October, 1860, he became tho manager of the St. James’s Theatre, from which he seceded in 1863. In October, 1867, Mr. Alfred Wigan opened the New Queen’s Theatre, Long Acre. <span class="titlem">Five Hundred Pounds Reward, Luck's All, The Model of a Wife, Watch and Ward</span>, and <span class="titlem">My Wife's Journal</span> may be enumerated among some fifty pieces, most of which are adaptations from the French. His brother, Mr. Horace Wigan, has also furnished about thirty comediettas and dramas to the stage, chiefly produced at the Olympic and the Strand.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA143"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1.43. </span><span class="head">WILLIAMS, Thomas J. </span></h2><p>— born July 19,1824, at Hampton Court, Middlesex. The greater portion of his youth was spent on the Continent. At school he was always remarked for a singular love and aptitude for the study of languages, and before the age of eighteen he had not only achieved “ honours” in the classics, but had thoroughly mastered the Italian, Spanish, French, and German languages. Indeed, the acquisition of a “new speech” had all his life long been a favourite recreation, and as a linguist Mr. T. J. Williams has always taken high ground. His first attempt at literary composition was a tale entitled “The Death of Darnley,” written when he was sixteen, and published in the columns of the "Mirror.” He had been anonymously connected with the stage as a dramatic author for some years before his name appeared in the “bills,” but his first acknowledged contribution to dramatic literature was a farce entitled <span class="titlem">I've Written to Brown</span>, produced at the Olympic in February, 1859. He is the author of two or three dramas and more than thirty farces, nearly all of which have “made their mark.” Among the most successful have been <span class="titlem">Turn Him Out</span> (Strand, 123 nights) ; <span class="titlem">Nursey Chickweed </span>(Princess’s) ; <span class="titlem">Jack's Delight</span> (Strand, 100 nights) ; <span class="titlem">Pipkin's Rustic Retreat</span> (Adelphi) ; <span class="titlem">Id on Parle Francais</span> (Adelphi, 300 times at that theatre) ; <span class="titlem">An Ugly Customer</span> (Adelphi, 95 nights) ; <span class="titlem">My Turn Next</span> (New Holborn, 116 consecutive nights) ; <span class="titlem">On and Off</span> (Strand, 90 nights), &amp;c., &amp;c.

Although her numerous novels, which have acquired such well-deserved popularity, have furnished an abundance of material to adapters, the principal piece Miss Braddon has as yet contributed to the stage is a neat two-act comedy, called Lores of <span class="titlem">Arcadia</span>, produced at the Strand Theatre, March 12,1860, and which met with a most favourable reception.

His earliest essay as a dramatist was a two-act drama called <span class="titlem">The Lighthouse</span>, first played in private, and produced at the Olympic, August 10,1857. It met with a decided success, and enjoyed a run of some weeks’ duration. On January 6,1857, <span class="titlem">The Frozen Deep</span>, a drama in three acts, was represented by the literary amateurs, including Mr. Charles Dickens, Mr. Mark Lemon, and the author, with scenic illustrations by the late Clarkson Stanfield, Mr. Danson, and Mr. Telbin, at Tavistock House. It was afterwards brought out, with the same cast, at the “Gallery of Illustration,” for the benefit of the Jerrold Fund, the Queen having previously witnessed a private representation at the same place, and on October 27, 1866, it was publicly performed at the Olympic Theatre. A remarkable drama, called <span class="titlem">The Red Vial</span>, produced at the Olympic, October 11,1858, and, in conjunction with Mr. Charles Dickens, a dramatic version of the story of <span class="titlem">No Thoroughfare</span>, brought out at the Adelphi, December 26, 1867, will be remembered in evidence of the powers of Mr.Wilkie Collins as a dramatist. The last-named piece enjoyed a run of 151 consecutive nights, the final representation taking place June 20, 1868.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA203"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2.3. </span><span class="head">DALY, JOHN.</span></h2><p>—The clever young dramatist who adopted this pseudonym, was Mr. John Besemeres, the head of a commercial firm of long standing. His first piece was a charming sketch, called <span class="titlem">Broken Toys</span>, produced at Sadler’s Wells in 1850. This was followed by the capital two-act comedy of <span class="titlem">Young Husbands</span>, performed at the same theatre in August, 1852. A singularly original drama, called <span class="titlem">The Times</span>, was his next success, brought out at the Olympic in July, 1853. Commercial pursuits soon after withdrew Mr. "John Daly’s” attention from the stage, but he has since furnished a cleverly written drama, called <span class="titlem">Old Salt</span>, produced at the Strand Theatre in January, 1868. For some years past Mr. Besemeres has resided in Calcutta, where he occupies a high mercantile position.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA204"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2.4. </span><span class="head">DICKENS, CHARLES.</span></h2><p>—This distinguished novelist, the son of Mr. John Dickens, of the Navy Pay Department, was born at Portsmouth in 1812. A few years afterwards his father retired on a pension, and came to London as a Parliamentary reporter. At an early age Mr. Dickens was removed from school and placed in the office of a barrister of eminence—Mr. Chitty, we believe. In the year 1834, he began to contribute to the " Old Monthly Magazine,” his first paper in that periodical being “Mrs. Joseph Porter over the way.” This was followed by “Horatio Sparkins," and “The Boarding House," but it was not until the publication of the second paper under the last title that he assumed the pseudonym of “Boz,” as may be found by reference to the “Old Monthly ” for August, 1834. Engaged as a parliamentary reporter on the <span class="titlem">Morning Chronicle</span>, then edited by Mr. John Black, he published in the evening edition of that paper a series of sketches— the first being “Meditations in Monmouth Street.” These were republished in three volumes, with illustrations by Cruikshank, early in 1836. Immediately after, he commenced the popular “Pickwick Papers,” completed in October, 1837, when the sale which originally was three thousand, had extended to thirty thousand copies. While writing the " sketches,” a strong inclination towards the stage induced Mr. Charles Dickens to test his powers as a dramatist, and his first piece, a farce called <span class="titlem">The Strange Gentleman</span>, was produced at the St. James’s Theatre on the opening night of the season, September 29,1836. The late Mr. Harley was the hero of the farce, which was received with great favour. This was followed by an opera, called <span class="titlem">The Village Coquettes</span>, for which Mr. Hullah composed the music, and which was brought out at the same establishment, Tuesday, December 6,1836. The quaint humour, unaffected pathos, and graceful lyrics of this production found prompt recognition, and the piece enjoyed a prosperous run. <span class="titlem">The Village Coquettes</span> took its title from two village girls, Lucy and Rose, led away by vanity, coquetting with men above them in station, and discarding their bumble, though worthy, lovers. Before, however, it is too late they see their error, and the piece terminates happily. Miss Rainforth and Miss Julia Smith were the heroines, and Mr. Bennett and Mr. Gardner were their betrothed lovers. Braham was the Lord of the Manor, who would have led astray the fair Lucy. There was a capital scene where he was detected by Lucy’s father, played by Strickland, urging an elopement. Harley had a trifling part in the piece, rendered highly amusing by his admirable acting. On March 6,1837 was brought out at the St. James's Theatre a farce, called <span class="titlem">Is She His Wife; or Something Singular</span> in which Harley played the principal character, Felix Tapkina, a flirting bachelor, and sang a song in the character of Pickwick, “written expressly for him by Boz.” The name of the author was not given in the playbill. The celebrity so rapidly acquired by Mr. Charles Dickens in other departments of literature, kept his pen from this time too constantly in request to enable him to follow up his early dramatic ventures, but the vivid portraitures of characters in his numerous novels have supplied adapters with a rich store of material for the stage</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA205"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2.5. </span><span class="head">DILLEY, JOSEPH.</span></h2><p>—In association with Mr. Albery, the adapter of a neat comedietta from the French, called <span class="titlem">Doctor Davy</span>, Mr. Joseph Dilley has written a nautical drama, entitled <span class="titlem">The Mate of the Mountjoy</span>, for which the T.

Medicine, however, being distasteful to him, he resolved to throw physic to the dogs, and pursue the bent of his inclinations in following an art which he had always loved and watched with so much interest. His dramatic taste became fostered by his intimacy with some of the leading actors and authors, and after some contributions to the Press, he resolved to make his appearance as an actor and author. As the former, his debut was made at Drury Lane Theatre, under the fostering care of his old friend, Charles Mathews. As an author, he made his first attempt in an adaptation from the French, entitled <span class="titlem">Dearest Mamma;</span> this enjoyed a long run, and was speedily followed by several other one-act pieces, but an original drama, <span class="titlem">Through Fire and Water</span>, produced at the Adelphi Theatre, with great success (June, 1865), and acted throughout the provinces by Mr. Toole, has considerably added to Mr Walter Gordon’s reputation.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA208"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2.8. </span><span class="head">HAZLEWOOD, COLIN HENRY </span></h2><p>— first turned his attention to authorship in 1850, producing a farce at the City of London Theatre, entitled <span class="titlem">Who's the Victim</span>, which, received with favour, prompted him to further efforts. He had been for some time previously the low comedian in the Lincoln, York, and Western Circuits. In 1851 he was engaged at the Surrey Theatre, appearing as Bobby Blackberry, in <span class="titlem">The Rover's Bride</span>, and was next engaged by Messrs. Nelson Lee and Johnson for the City of London Theatre as low comedian. Here he remained ten years, producing dramas, farces, burlesques, &amp;c., in rapid succession. A farce, called <span class="titlem">The Bonnet Builders Tea Party</span>, was brought out at the Strand Theatre, then under the, management of the late J. H. Tully, and its success stimulated him to continue writing. <span class="titlem">Jenny Foster</span> and <span class="titlem">The Return of the Wanderer</span> were then written for the Britannia Theatre, and had a long run. These were followed by <span class="titlem">Waiting for the Verdict</span>, produced at the City of London Theatre, and which drew crowded houses for many weeks. The New Britannia Theatre has brought out the greatest number of Mr. Hazlewood’s dramas: the most noticeable are <span class="titlem">Our Lot in Life , Cast on the Mercy of the World, The Downfall of Pride, Rescue of the Orphans, The Castaway</span>, <span class="titlem">The Life of a Weaver</span>, &amp;c., His son, Mr. Hazlewood, junior, is also known as the author of various burlesques, chiefly produced at the Alexandra Theatre.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA209"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2.9. </span><span class="head">HOLLINGSHEAD, John.</span></h2><p>—This energetic writer is the son of Mr. Henry R.

His second piece was <span class="titlem">The Game of Speculation</span>, brought out with much success at the Lyceum, Oct. 2nd, 1851.

The dramatic works of Mr. G. H. Lewes thus produced have not been identified with his own name, but are associated with the pseudonyms of Slingsby Lawrence and Frank Churchill.

Mr. Lovell’s first play was <span class="titlem">The Avenger</span>, produced at the Surrey Theatre, under the management of Mr. Davidge, in 1835, when Mr. Butler sustained the principal character. This was followed by the <span class="titlem">Provost of Bruges</span>, brought out, with Mr. Macready as the hero, at Drury Lane, under Bunn’s management, February 10th, 1836. The plot was founded on the story of “The Serf,” related in Leitch Ritchie’s “Romance of History,” and the piece attained a great success. A novel, called " The Trustee,” published by Colburn, further advanced Mr. Lovell’s literary fame, and this was succeeded by another five-act play, <span class="titlem">Love's Sacrifice</span>, brought out at Covent Garden during the management of Mr. Charles Kemble (12th September, 1842), with Mr. Vandenhoff. Then followed the comedy, <span class="titlem">Look Before You Leap</span>, produced by Mr. Webster at the Haymarket, 29th October, 1846, and the famous play of <span class="titlem">The Wife's Secret</span>, purchased by Mr. Charles Kean, who fully relied on the talent of the author, for four hundred pounds, before a line was written, originally acted in America, and brought out at the Haymarket, 17th January, 1848. <span class="titlem">The Wife's Secret</span> ran thirty-six nights with undiminished effect, and the engagement of the Keans, originally for thirty nights, was consequently extended to sixty. Mr. Lovell’s latest production was <span class="titlem">The Trial of Love</span>, produced at the Princess’s, January 7th, 1852, which ran for twenty-three nights, with Mr. and Mrs. Kean in the principal characters. Mrs. Lovell, formerly Miss Lacy, an esteemed tragic actress of Covent Garden Theatre, is also known to the public as the authoress of <span class="titlem">Ingomar</span> (Drury Lane, 1851), and <span class="titlem">The Beginning and the End</span> (Haymarket, 1854).</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA212"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2.12. </span><span class="head">PAUL, HOWARD </span></h2><p>— born at Philadelphia, U.S., America, December, 1830.

His first piece was a three-act drama, founded on incidents of the American revolutionary war, and it had a great run in his native city. He was then sixteen years of age. Mr. Paul of late years has been so actively and profitably employed with his popular entertainment (being author, actor, and his own manager), that he has done little with his pen in the dramatic way. His best known plays are <span class="titlem">Thrice Married</span>, which ran one hundred nights at the Princess’s, <span class="titlem">The Mob Cap</span>, played at Drury Lane in 1863, <span class="titlem">Opposite Neighbours</span> (Strand), <span class="titlem">Bappings and Table-Movings</span> (Haymarket), <span class="titlem">A Lucky Hit</span> (Princess’s), and the <span class="titlem">Old Folks</span>, produced at the Strand, 1867.

His first farce, entitled <span class="titlem">Who’s Who</span>, was represented at Drury Lane, in 1815. As a useful hint to aspiring dramatists, it may be mentioned that this piece, as originally written, consisted of ninety pages. Its unconscionable length drew from the theatrical copyist Who was doomed to the labour of transcribing it, this pathetic appeal—" Oh, sir, your two-act farce is as long as <span class="titlem">The School for Scandal.</span> If you could but cut it beforehand and save me a little trouble.” This hint the dramatist then declined taking, though to this necessity he was in the end reduced, more than half the dialogue being expunged. His next farce, <span class="titlem">Deaf at a Poet</span>, produced at Drury Lane in 1823, owes much of its original popularity to the humour of Liston, who made the character of Tristram Sappy his own. It was first of all in two acts, but was subsequently reduced to one. Among the pieces Mr. John Poole afterwards contributed to the stage, most of them being derived from French sources, there were produced at Covent Garden <span class="titlem">A Short Reign and a Merry One, The Two Pages of Frederick the Great, The Scapegoat, A Nabob for an Howr</span>, and <span class="titlem">The Wife's Stratagem</span>, a comedy altered from Shirley.

In 1857 he was called to the Bar of the Inner Temple, and for some time practised on the Oxford Circuit. In 1860, shortly before the outbreak of the American war, Mr. Walters made a lengthened tour through the United States, and on his return proclaimed his sympathies with the Confederate cause in a pamphlet which was favourably received, not only in England, but in many of the cities of the Union. His first dramatic venture, <span class="titlem">Under the Rose</span>, a free adaptation of a popular Palais Royal vaudeville, was produced at the St. James’s Theatre, during Mr. George Vining’s management, March 24,1862. This was followed, June 2, at the same theatre, by <span class="titlem">Forty Winks</span>, a duologue comedietta, which ran the whole of the summer season, and,soon after, Mr. Walters, still under the pseudonym of George Roberts, was brought more prominently into public favour by his very effective adaptation of Miss Braddon’s popular novel," Lady Audley’s Secret.” This version, specially sanctioned by the authoress,brought out under Mr. Frank Matthews’s management at the St. James’s (February 28th, 1863), had a run of 104 nights at that theatre, was frequently reproduced, was translated into the French for Mdlle. Duverger, and has become a favourite stock-piece on the provincial stage. Among Mr. Walters's later productions may be mentioned <span class="titlem">Cousin Tom </span>(Princess’s, June 8, 1863), <span class="titlem">Ample Apology</span> (Princess’s, March 13th, 1865)—this farce was on the bills for more than 150 consecutive nights,—<span class="titlem">Three Furies</span> (March 13,1865), and <span class="titlem">Idalia</span> (St. James’s, April 22, 1867), a three-act drama, which, though partly founded on the novel of that name, was original in treatment of plot, situation, &amp;c.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA216"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2.16. </span><span class="head">SERLE, Thomas James </span></h2><p>— was born in Gracechurch-street, October 28,1798, and educated for the Bar. Between the age of sixteen and eighteen, Mr. Serle wrote four five-act plays which were presented to Drury Lane by Peter Moore, M.P. for Coventry, then one of the committee of the theatre, and of course refused; but the notice taken served for encouragement. At the age of eighteen he played Romeo at the Theatre Royal, Liverpool— Vandenhoff, Mercutio ; and soon after (1820 and 1821) played Hamlet at Cambridge, Croydon, and seven times at the “Regency” Theatre, Tottenham-court-road—brought out a five-act play there, and acted the principal character, Rupert Duval, three nights. Mr Serle next played a season at the Old Royalty, opening in Hamlet—C. Stanfield then painted the scenery there. In 1819, published a play, <span class="titlem">Raffael Cimaro</span>, five acts, and wrote the paper on Ben Jonson, second article, in No. 2 of the “Retrospective Review.” In 1823, published <span class="titlem">Fulvius Valeus</span>, in five acts. Played in the country, bringing out <span class="titlem">Waltheoff the Saxon</span>, five acts, at Exeter, and <span class="titlem">The Parricide</span>, five acts, at Dover—which-- theatre be managed two seasons for the committee of the townspeople, playing at Boulogne in the summer of 1824. In the spring of 1825, he played at the Theatre Royal du Parc, Brussels, Talma playing at the Theatre de la Monnaie. Talma introduced himself to the young actor and author behind the scenes, and mentioned him at the British Embassy favourably, which introduced him to notice in London. The celebrated Mme. Tallien, “Goddess of Reason ” in the French Revolution, then Princess de Chimaye, bespoke <span class="titlem">Hamlet</span> the second time. Came over to England, played at Lincoln, &amp;c., &amp;c. Engaged at Covent Garden Theatre, and opened in <span class="titlem">Hamlet</span>, November, 1825, and repeated it with <span class="titlem">Jaffier, Othello</span>, &amp;c.; remained three seasons, playing with Edmd. Kean, Young, C. Kemble, &amp;c. Played at Norwich, and then at the Old Coburg, with E. Kean, &amp;c.; translated and adapted <span class="titlem">Dominique, Victim of St. Vincent:</span> and <span class="titlem">Man in the Iron Mask</span>, playing the principal characters. When the attempt was made on the part of the great houses to close all the minor theatres, Mr. Serle took his full share in the resistance. There was a majority in the House of Commons for abolishing the monopoly, but the Lords threw out the Bill. Afterwards, however, a jury refused to convict in the case of Osbaldiston, then manager of the Surrey. Mr. Serle then wrote the <span class="titlem">Merchant of London</span>, a play in five acts, produced nt Drury Lane in the spring of 1832; <span class="titlem">House of Colberg</span>, in five acts, autumn of same year, Mr. Macready acting in both. Mr. Serie about this time called together the Dramatic Authors, by advertisement signed by himself and Douglas Jerrold, and so helped to found the Dramatic Authors’ Society, of which he was Honorary Secretary for some years. His next production was <span class="titlem">The Yeoman's Daughter</span>, a domestic drama, in two acts, in which, with the Lyceum Company, at the Adelphi, he played the principal character. In 1833 was produced <span class="titlem">The Ghost Story</span>, two acts, under Bond’s management at the Adelphi. Mr. Serle became in 1834 stage-manager at the English Opera, Lyceum Theatre, and opened it with an address written and spoken by himself, <span class="titlem">The Yeoman's Daughter</span> being the first piece. In this year he wrote and spoke the Prologue to Miss Mitford’s tragedy of <span class="titlem">Charles II.</span>, produced at the Victoria, under Abbott and Egerton. In 1835 he produced and acted in <span class="titlem">The Shadow on the Wall</span>, at the Lyceum, two acts; and <span class="titlem">Widow Queen</span>, comedy, two acts. In 1836, spoke the Prologue to the tragedy of <span class="titlem">Ion</span>, on its first representation at Covent Garden, for Macready’s benefit, and wrote <span class="titlem">The Witch's Son</span>, two acts. Lectured on the plays of Shakspeare and dramatic subjects at almost all the Institutions in London, at Liverpool, and Manchester, till he had exhausted the repertory. About this period Mr. Serle married Cecilia, daughter of Vincent Novello, the composer, and sister of Mrs. Cowden Clarke and Clara Novello, now Countess Gigliucci. Joined the Covent Garden company under Mr. Macready in the autumn of 1837. Produced <span class="titlem">Afrancesado</span>, two acts; <span class="titlem">Parole of Honour</span>, two acts; and <span class="titlem">Joan of Arc</span>, two acts; was acting manager, season 1838-9. Produced <span class="titlem">Agnes Bernauer</span>, two acts. Altered, arranged, &amp;c., as acting-manager and reader. Read through every MS., above 200 in the season, that were not palpably unfit. In 1838 and 1839 went over all the parts of France connected with the history of Joan of Arc, and wrote a novel and a romance, published by Colburn, called “The Players” and “Joan of Arc.” In 1810, brought out <span class="titlem">Master Clarke</span>, a play in five acts, on the subject of Richard Cromwell, at the Haymarket —Richard Cromwell, Mr. Macready. In autumn of 1840, wrote four plays on the History of France, to be read as lectures, and read them at almost all the London Institutions— <span class="titlem">The Proscribed, The Jacquerie, The Queen and the Minister</span>, and <span class="titlem">Gaston de Foix</span>, each in five acts, occupying about an hour and a half in reading. In autumn of 1841, resumed acting management with Mr. Macready, at Drury Lane; translated and adapted <span class="titlem">Sappho</span>, opera from the Italian, and remained acting-manager to the close of the season 1842-3, when Mr. Macready’s tenure expired. After this time other avocations began to take up the greater part of his attention, which finally was engrossed by them. Mr. Serle managed for Mitchell the English Company in Paris, 1844-5, when Mr. Macready and Miss Helen Faucit played there, and wrote the opening address for Sadler’s Wells (the Warner and Phelps management); produced there <span class="titlem">The Priest's Daughter</span>, tragedy, in five acts. Adapted Beaumont and Fletcher’s <span class="titlem">Scornful Ladg</span>, and <span class="titlem">Double Marriage</span>, for Mrs. Warner’s management at the Marylebone Theatre. A three-act domestic drama, at the Surrey, <span class="titlem">A Village Story</span>, and a one-act comedy, <span class="titlem">Tender Precautions</span>, at the Princess’s, which was played at Windsor Castle the last time any theatrical performance was given there, may be said to include all the works of this prolific dramatist.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA217"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2.17. </span><span class="head">SOUTAR, ROBERT </span></h2><p>— eldest son of the late Mr. Robert Soutar, for many years a prominent member of the literary profession, and long associated with the critical department of “The Morning Advertiser ” and “Literary Gazette.” At an early period of his life turned his attention to the stage, on which he has since gained an established position as a comedian. His first piece was a farce, called <span class="titlem">The Fast Coach</span>, produced at the Olympic Theatre, June 9th, 1851. This was followed by another farce, entitled <span class="titlem">A Deed without a Name</span>, brought out on the same boards; <span class="titlem">Never Taste Wine at the Docks—</span>Strand; <span class="titlem">Quicksand and Whirlpools</span>—Victoria; and <span class="titlem">The Chinese Giant</span>—Marylebone. Mr. Robert Soutar is also the author of several pantomimes, produced with success at the Brighton, Marylebone, and Victoria Theatres.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA218"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2.18. </span><span class="head">TRAVERS, WILLIAM.</span></h2><p>—Mr. W. Travers, after some years’ probation in the provinces as an actor, made a successful appearance in London, at Sadler’s Wells Theatre, under Mr. Phelps’s management. He subsequently joined Messrs. Johnson and Nelson Lee, at the City of London Theatre, and remained there for ten years. It was at this theatre he first turned his attention to dramatic authorship: his introductory drama, entitled <span class="titlem">A Poor Girls Temptations; or, a Voice from the Streets</span>, was a decided success in 1857, and enjoyed a lengthened run. Stimulated to further efforts, <span class="titlem">Il Trovatore</span> and <span class="titlem">Dinorah </span> followed ; the latter produced at the Marylebone, under the management of Mr. J. A. Cave. <span class="titlem">Cartouche</span>, and the Irish drama of <span class="titlem">Kathleen Mavoumeen</span>, established Mr. Travers position at the East End of London. During the last ten years more than a hundred dramas emanating from his pen have been produced in London and the Provinces ; and the day should not be far distant when some of his productions reach the West End.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA219"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2.19. </span><span class="head">TROUGHTON, ADOLPHUS CHARLES </span></h2><p>— is the second son of Richard Touch Troughton, of Chiswick, and grandson of the late Richard Troughton, who held the ancient and well- known family seat and estates of Lady Place, Berks, which formerly belonged to the Lovelace family. After having seen a great deal of military, naval, and cathedral church life in the neighbourhood of Rochester and Chatham, where he resided for fourteen years, his first dramatic attempt was made, <span class="titlem">Living too Fast; or, a Twelvemonth's Honeymoon</span>, and it may be mentioned, <span class="foreign">pour encourager les autres,</span> that this piece for three or four years was in succession kicked out of nearly every first-class theatre in London, and treated with the utmost contempt by the managers, with the exception of the late Mr. William Farren (at that time manager of the Olympic), who wrote a letter in a trembling hand to express his admiration of the performance. Mr. Charles Kean, however, took a different view of his capacities as a dramatist to the majority of his brother managers, and produced the little comedy at the Princess’s, on the 9th of October, 1854. The piece was well received, and after a long run, extending over three or four seasons in London, was played all over the provinces. The next to take him by the hand was that excellent actress, the late Mrs. Fitzwilliam, who warmly espoused his cause at the Haymarket, where <span class="titlem">Leading Strings </span>was rehearsed, and announced up to the very eve of its production, when its career was unfortunately cut short by that lady’s sudden death from cholera, in 1854; his comedy being found under her pillow after her death. The comedy afterwards found a friend in Mrs. Stirling, and was produced at the Olympic, under the Robson and Emden management, on the 19th of October, 1857. The dates of production of Mr. Troughton’s dramas are as follows:—<span class="titlem">Wooing in Jest and Loving in Earnest</span>, November 1st, 1858—Strand. <span class="titlem">Vandyke Brown</span>, March 24th, 1859—Strand. <span class="titlem">Shameful Behaviour</span>, November 28th, 1859—Strand. <span class="titlem">Short and Sweet</span>, October 10th, 1861—Strand. <span class="titlem">Unlimited Confidence</span>, February 1st, 1864—Strand. <span class="titlem">The Fly and the Web</span>, February 5th, 1866—Strand.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA220"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2.20. </span><span class="head">WILLS, W. G.</span></h2><p>—As the author of several novels which have been favourably received by the literary world, Mr. W. G. Wills has become well known to the reading public, but his dramatic reputation at present rests upon the success of a four-act drama, called <span class="titlem">The Man o' Airlie</span>, brought out during a summer season at the Princess’s Theatre, July 20th, 1867. The leading idea of the piece was derived from a German play, entitled <span class="titlem">Lorbeerbaum und Bettelstab</span> (the laurel tree and beggar-staff), written by Carl Von Holtei, but the treatment of the subject differed considerably from that of the foreign author, and the literary merits of the play were sufficiently great to justify a high expectation of the service which Mr. W. G. Wills would render the stage by continuing to apply his talents in this direction.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="LDA221"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2.21. </span><span class="head">WILSON, John Crawford </span></h2><p>— born 1826, at Mallow, in the county of Cork, Ireland. First appeared before the world in a literary capacity, as occasional contributor to some of the leading London journals. Coming to reside in London, he, in 1852, published his first volume, a poem, under the title of “The Village Pearl." This was speedily followed by a serial story in “Bentley’s Miscellany,” reissued, on completion, by Messrs. Bentley, under the title of “Jonathan Oldaker." In 1855 he contributed his “Flights to Fairyland,” poetic legends in the style of Ingoldsby, to the “Dublin University Magazine. Also several papers to the earlier numbers of the “Welcome Guest," when that journal was under the editorship of the late Mr. Robert Brough. His first drama, <span class="titlem">Gitanilla; or, the Children of the Zincali</span>, was produced with great success at the Surrey Theatre, in 1860. <span class="titlem">The Knuckle Duster</span>, a farce, in which the late Mr. James Rogers sustained the principal character, was, in 1863, brought out at the Strand Theatre. In 1865 Messrs.
