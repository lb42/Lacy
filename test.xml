    <p>This is an enhanced and extended version of the catalogue of Lacy's Acting Edition originally
     created by the Victorian Plays Project (VPP), made by screen-scraping and re-encoding data
     archived at <ref target="http://victorian.nuigalway.ie/modx/index.php?id=64">the VPP_website at
      NUI Galway</ref>.<note> (These modernized PDFs are also available from <ref
       target="https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/51111508/view-pdf-victorian-plays-project"
       >YUMPU</ref>)</note></p>
    <p>The catalogue has been cross-checked against several other contemporary sources. Various
     minor errors and inconsistencies have been corrected, and additional information added,
     particularly about available digitizations of the plays. </p>
    
    
    <p>Authors' names have been standardised, in the form "Surname, Forenames-or-initials" following
     the most frequent usage in cases of doubt. Square brackets are used to indicate that the author
     name contained within them is not attested on the titlepage of the work in question; the
     attribute <att>resp</att> is used to indicate the grounds for making the attribution, and takes
     one of the following values: <list type="gloss">
      <item>btao: ("By The Author Of") the title is listed in a btao indication somewhere</item>
      <item>ATC: attribution is made in the Adelphi Theatre Catalog</item>
      <item>msnote: attribution is made by manuscript annotation on a library copy</item>
      <item>nicoll: attribution made in Allardyce Nicoll's Handlist</item>
