    <p>This is an enhanced and extended version of the catalogue of Lacy's Acting Edition originally
     created by the <ref target="http://victorian.nuigalway.ie/modx/index.php?id=64">Victorian Plays
     Project</ref> (VPP) at the University of Galway. That project's website has been inaccessible
     for some time, though some of the modernized PDFs it produced are still available from <ref
     target="https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/51111508/view-pdf-victorian-plays-project"
     >YUMPU</ref>. The present catalogue has been made by screen-scraping and re-encoding data
     originally created by the VPP, which has been cross-checked against other contemporary sources.
     Many minor errors and inconsistencies have been corrected, and much additional information
     added, particularly about available digitizations of the plays. </p>
    <p>Lacy's Acting Edition was published both in the form of individual play scripts, and as a set
     of 100 bound volumes, each containing 15 plays. The catalogue is organized in the same way as
     the original volumes. For more about Lacy and the Acting Edition, see </p>

    <p>Authors' names have been standardised, in the form "Surname, Forenames-or-initials" following
     the most frequent usage in cases of doubt. Square brackets are used to indicate that the author
     name contained within them is not attested on the titlepage of the work in question; the
     attribute <att>resp</att> is used to indicate the grounds for making the attribution, and takes
     one of the following values: <list type="gloss">
     <item>btao: ("By The Author Of") the title is listed in a btao indication somewhere</item>
     <item>ATC: attribution is made in the Adelphi Theatre Catalog</item>
     <item>msnote: attribution is made by manuscript annotation on a library copy</item>
     <item>nicoll: attribution made in Allardyce Nicoll's Handlist</item>
