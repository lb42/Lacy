    <list>
     <item>With only modest success as a playwright and actor initially, Lacy eventually became the
      leading theatrical publisher of "Acting Editions" -- practical working documents printed at 6d
      a copy for individual titles, or 5s for a bound volume of 15 titles. </item>
     <item>Between 1848 and 1873, his <title>Lacy's Acting Edition of Plays</title>, grew to contain
      100 volumes of 15 titles each: it was sold across the globe, and made him a reasonable
      fortune.</item>
     <item>The LAE is a unique sample, apparently covering the full range of Victorian Theatrical
      presentations</item>
     <item>For comparison, vols 4 and 5 of Allardyce Nicoll's magisterial <title>History of English
       Drama</title> list c. 24,000 distinct titles performed between 1800 and 1900.</item>

   <div type="slide">
    <head>How representative is this sample?</head>
    <p>A corpus is a sample, hopefully representative of a known population. Initial comparisons
     between the LAE and Allardyce Nicoll's <title>Handlist</title>s suggest distributions of size,
     age, and mode are comparable. </p>

    <p rend="box">"It is hard to avoid the conclusion that Lacy astutely leavened the mix for each
     volume, using mainly contemporary titles to complement the old favourites." (cf. <ref

    <list>
     <item>Builds on and expands data from Richard Pearson's <title>Victorian Plays Project</title>
      (VPP), AHRB funded 2005-2007 </item>
     <item>
      <list>
       <item>The VPP produced a catalogue of the LAE, along with c. 15000 page images from a copy
        held at Birmingham Library</item>
       <item>These were OCRd, proofed, and made available in a PDF format as visually faithful as
        possible to the original</item>
       <item>By 2014, the project had processed 340 titles which were distributed from a site at the
        University of Galway</item>
       <item>Following Pearson's death in 2018, the project was frozen; by June 2022 the website had
        disappeared...</item>
      </list></item>
     <item>In 2022, with the aid of researchers who worked on the project, I recovered most of the
      resources it had created and archived them on github </item>
     <item>Digital Lacy now combines : <list>
       <item> a detailed and expanding set of metadata relating to the LAE and its authors, enhanced
        with links to available digital versions</item>
       <item>a slowly increasing number of TEI-XML transcripts</item>

    <head>How close ?</head>
    <p>Dracor and Lacy have a few ideological differences...</p>
    <list>
     <item>In DraCor metadata, the digital version is primary, any source version being nested
      within it; in Lacy, that hierarchy is reversed. </item>
     <item>Some DraCor metadata (notably performances and identifiers) is relegated to a
       <gi>standOff</gi>; in Lacy it is imbricated in the TEI Header </item>
     <item>Dracor uses explicit scene divisions to define stage-presence, as the basis for its
      network analysis; a quarter of Lacy titles don't have scene divisions.</item>
     <item>Lacy uses many of the available TEI tags for the front matter of a play ; Dracor largely
      ignores this.</item>
     <item>Lacy makes explicit that role is gendered (not supported by Dracor ODD)</item>
    </list>
    <p rend="box">However - the Dracor team is very responsive and helpful !</p>

    <head>Tentative suggestions and conclusions</head>
    <list>
     <item>TEI conformance is crucial to the interoperability of Dracor corpora. The Dracor
      profile/ODD should specify which parts of the TEI model are mandatory, desirable, permissible,
      unsupported ... </item>
     <item>The documentation provided by the Dracor ODD is good, but could be improved: more
      examples and more discussion of some edge cases would be useful for example</item>
     <item>Simple tutorial guides showing how to use Dracor-conformant corpora with a variety of
      tools (not only python, plz)</item>
     <item>Provide a forum for corpus creators to discuss possible solutions to common encoding problems</item>
