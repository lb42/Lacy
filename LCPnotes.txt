0. The file driver.xml includes 2466 LCP records from the BT project, for years 1852-1863 inclusive, auto reformatted in XML, not entirely reliably.

1. Of these, 2407 have an explicitly marked licence, and only 518 an explicitly marked pubNote.

2. 506 entries contain the string 'Lacy', 426 of them within the aforesaid pubNotes

3. The file LacyLCP.xml contains 436 more or less accurately structured descriptions of LCP entries, extracted from the foregoing and hand-edited. It's in the repo.

4. Also in the repo is LCPlist.xml, which contains 424 records from the same sources but only for the years 1861 and 1862; these include an indication of the Nicoll entry number for all but 60 (of which 54 are explicitly missing according to BT project). [Where is script to add NIC ids?]

5. 400 of the 436 entries in (3) above have been added as eventNames to the appropriate entry in catalogue.xml (scripts makeAdds and addAdds; much fiddling)
