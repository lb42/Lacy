  <head>Millingen, John Gideon</head>
  <p>Died 7 June 1849 (death certificate). While 1782 remains the
   preferred year of birth, some confusion still surrounds this date. The d.cert. gives his age at
   death as 65, producing a d.o.b. of 1785; however, ages were sometimes rounded off. In 1862 his
   daughter, Letitia Millingen, told the RLF (case 1597) that her father was born in 1783, but she
   is vague even about her own age, which she gives as ‚Äòabout 48.‚Äô For the only contemporary record
   of his d.o.b., see W.C.B., ‚ÄòEnglish Freemasons in France, 1817,‚Äô N&amp;amp;Q, 8 Nov. 1890, 384,
   which prints an 1817 list of the members of the Masonic lodge of St. Fr√©derick des Amis Choisis,
   Boulogne, most of them English military personnel ‚Äòin cantonment‚Äô nearby (Millingen was a
   military surgeon). This gives his dob. as 8 Sept. 1782, making him 66 at death. See ODNB.</p>
