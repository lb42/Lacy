     108 down to 1881 when all the houses in Oxford st. west of Tottenham Court road were
     renumbered. There is a portrait of Lemon by John Leech in his two-page cartoon called “Mr.
     Punch’s fancy ball” in Punch 9 Jany. 1847 as the conductor of the orchestra. In Alfred Bunn’s A
     word with Punch 1847 Lemon is spoken of as Thickhead, there is a portrait representing him as a
     pot boy and it is suggested that he was a tailor and vastly like Moses. He wrote the first
     article in the first number of Punch entitled The Moral of Punch. The rev. J. Richardson, LL.B.
     states in his Recollections of the last half century vol. 1 (1856) 80–2 that Lemon kept the
     Shakespeare’s Head tavern in Wych st. Strand for one year after his marriage. In “Mr. Punch:
