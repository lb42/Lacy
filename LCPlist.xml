                the Ambigu-Comique, Paris, on 5 March 1861, it also lists Conquest's production at
                the Grecian but the script does not coincide with the Lacy's version. A further
                performance is cited at the Standard on 1 June 1861, entitled 'The midnight angel,
                or, twelve o' clock and the spirit of death' which is clearly attributed to J. T.
                Douglass on the front cover of the MS and varies from the Lacy's edition script.
                There therefore appears to be no original manuscript version of Suter and Lacy's
                play, implying that it was written specifically for publication. See also Add. 53004
