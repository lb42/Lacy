    <head>Scene.—A Street in Paris, Rue de l'Echelle.</head>


    <stage>L. H. a Shed, the interior of which faces the audience, it opens into the second room.
     R.H. a Nobleman's House, in the centre, at the back, is the Fountain. Streets branching from it
     right and left. </stage>
    <stage>[As the curtain rises, Cabri and several Water Carriers are grouped around the Fountain,
     one after the other filling their pails. Javotte apart from them, seated on the wooden frame,
     which she rests upon her pails. She sings.]</stage>

     <l>A lonely maid I've wander'd far,</l>
     <l> And gaily met each weary day ;</l>
     <l> For every night love's trembling star</l>
     <l> Lighted the morrow with its ray.</l>
     <l>The day is long, but toil is light, </l>
     <l>And all around me happy seems ;</l>
     <l>For when I seek repose at night, </l>
     <l>My heart beats softly through my dreams.</l>
     <l>I dream that he who has my heart, </l>
     <l>Doth call me his own little wife ;</l>
     <l>And if I wake up with a start, </l>
     <l>I wake up to new hope, new life!</l>

     <p>During the last six months I have been the Duke's confidant and factotum; he took an immense
      and immediate fancy to me—a man of great discernment, the Duke! Appointed governor of St.
      Domingo, he received at the moment of his departure, a letter from the Marquis, announcing his
      arrest; and the fact that he had left a will among his papers, revealing the existence of a
      son, whom he had brought up in secret, because the child's mother had proved herself unworthy
      to bear the name of de Melcy. This son he commended to the protection of the Duke.</p>

      he married secretly; fortunately before the marriage was avowed, he learnt that his wife was
      worthless, as well as birthless, and so discarded her. Now, I am at all hazards, to secure the

    <head>A Storm At Sea.</head>
    <stage>The Scene represents the open Sea in the midst of a Hurricane. A large dismasted Vessel
     tossed on the tempest is seen rolling heavily among the billows. Four or five only of the crew
     are left on the wreck, and are clinging to the spars and broken mast. At intervals between the
     roar of the ocean and the peals of thunder, broken sentences are caught from those on board;
     the following being more distinctly heard:</stage>
    <sp who="#L0313_M1">

     <p>We are in sight of land I tell you, and if the wreck will but float a short time longer, we
      shall be on the rocks of St. Domingo.</p>
     <stage>[A terrific peal of Thunder is heard — the lightning runs along the sky, and the vessel
      goes down bodily, amidst a shriek from those on board. The waves wash over her, and nothing is
      seen but the open sea. In a few seconds two men are visible buffeting with the waves, and
      Gaspard crawls on to a small rock on the foreground. </stage>

     <p>Oh! how gladly shall I return to announce it. The poverty I have struggled to conceal, is
      not the consequence of a fault, nor of idleness. I have sought work everywhere, but it not

     <p>Not so; but I am a gentleman by education. A worthy man, whose name I never knew, placed me
      at the College of Beauvais, and furnished me with the means of pursuing my studies there, when
      suddenly my pension ceased, and I never heard of my benefactor more. Thrown thus upon the
      world without resources, without family, I resolved to profit by the education I received—I
      had became Secretary to the Count de Cremancé.</p>

     <p>By having a heart that forgot my humble state—by daring to love the daughter of the Count,
      who loved me in return. Driven from the house like a valet, who has rubbed his master, I have
      since vainly sought employment, until today, when the chance of the Marquis de Melcy's

     <p>I can't think why my husband should have made a mystery of his little fortune to me; I had
      no suspicion of anything of the kind till three years ago, when we moved into this house to be
      near Thérèse. Late one night, Bonneau believing me to be asleep, rose gently from the bed, and
      through my half closed eyes I saw him take out of one of the water buckets a small canvas bag,
      which seemed very heavy, and with it he passed out of the next room into this. I followed him;
      saw him lift up one of these squares, and after digging in the ground underneath with his
      knife, he hid the bag carefully away, and closed the square over it. When he returned, I still
      feigned to be asleep, but I lay awake, torturing myself with all sorts of absurd suspicions.
      In the morning, while Bonneau was gone to work, I raised the stone, opened the bag, and found
      it full of gold.</p>

     <p>You see, Brididi, I had always from a girl a presentiment that I should gain a fortune in
      the lottery; but, in my miserable existence, the chance had never occurred of my being
      <pb n="48"/>able to buy a ticket. But now that chance was ready to my hand. I struggled
      against it for weeks, but alas! I struggled in vain, for I fell at last.</p>

      that the bag contained is now gone, and if the prize does not come up this time, all is over.

      the ocean. I found you poor, friendless, helpless. I made you rich, noble, powerful.
       <stage>[Aside.]</stage> The mere turn of a pen effected the miracle. <stage>[Aloud.]</stage>
      In consideration thereof, and in the gratitude of your heart, you signed this little

      possessions were doubtful ; but now that it rests but with yourself to remove the
      sequestration—now that a handsome wife, with a million of money, is offered to you—I cannot
      permit this little debt of a hundred thousand francs to stand over—it would be my ruin.
