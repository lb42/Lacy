    <head>REMARKS.</head>
    <head> Ambrose Gwinett.</head>
    <p>Hypercriticism has presumed to find fault with this drama, which a better taste has
     denominated “<emph>the serious domestic historical</emph>,” because, forsooth, it smacks of the
     Old Bailey!—and, when justification has been pleaded by citing <title>George Barnwell</title>,
     we have received the retort courteous, in the story of the witling who affected to wear glasses
     because Pope was near-sighted.  But a much better plea may be urged than the example of a bard
     so moderately gifted as Lillo!  “The Ravens of Orleans,” “Dog of Montargis,” “Family of
     Anglade,” and numerous other public favourites, speak daggers to such hypercriticism.—Ambrose
     Gwinett is a strange tale and a true one; and a tale both strange and true what playwright can
     afford to let slip through his fingers?  A murder or so may be prudently relinquished, for the
     season will come round again; but he cannot expect to see a man hanged and resuscitated for his
     especial accommodation every day in the week.</p>
    <p>Ambrose Gwinett favoured the world with his autobiography at a period when autobiography was
     a rarity.  He is unquestionably the only historian who has written his life after being
     gibbetted—drawn and quartered we leave to the autobiographers and dramatists of another
     generation!  Egotism under such extraordinary circumstances may surely be pardoned; and if
     honest Ambrose dwell somewhat complacently on certain events of deep interest and wonder, he
     may plead a much better excuse than our modern autobiographers, who invent much and reveal
     little but a tedious catalogue of fictions and vanities; a charge that applies not to the
     startling narrative of the poor sweeper of the once insignificant village of Charing.</p>
    <p>The story, which occurred in the reign of Queen Anne, is simple and well told.  Ambrose had a
     tale to tell—(what autobiographer would not be half hanged to be entitled to tell a similar
     one?)—passing strange and pitiful; therefore, like a skilful dramatist, who depends solely on
     his plot, he affected no pomp of speech: of tropes and figures he knew nothing; but he knew
     full well that he had been hanged without a trope, and his figure brought to life again!</p>
    <pb n="6"/>
    <p>“I was born,” says he, “of respectable parents in the city of Canterbury, where my father
     dealt in slops.  He had but two children, a daughter and myself; and, having given me a school
     education, at the age of sixteen he bound me apprentice to Mr. George Roberts, an attorney in
     the same town, with whom I stayed four years and three quarters, to his great content and my
     own satisfaction.</p>
    <p>“My sister, having come to woman’s estate, had now been married something more than a
     twelvemonth to one Sawyer, a seafaring man, who, having got considerable prizes, my father also
     giving him 200<emph>l.</emph> with my sister, quitted his profession, and set up a public-house
     near the place of his nativity, which was Deal, in the county of Kent.  I had frequent
     invitations to pass a short time with them; and, in the autumn of 1709, having obtained my
     master’s consent for that purpose, I left the city of Canterbury on foot, on Wednesday morning,
     being the 17th day of September; but, through some unavoidable delays on the road, the evening
     was considerably advanced before I reached Deal; and so tired was I, being unused to that way
     of travelling, that, had my life depended on it, I could not have gone so far as my sister’s
     that night.  At this time there were many of her majesty, Queen Anne’s ships lying in the
     harbour, the English being then at war with the French and Spaniards; besides which, I found
     this was the day for holding the yearly fair, so that the town was filled to that degree, that
     not a bed was to be gotten for love nor money.  I went seeking a lodging from house to house to
     no purpose; till, being quite spent, I returned to the public-house, where I had first made
     inquiry, desiring leave to sit by their kitchen-fire to rest myself till morning.</p>
    <p>“The publican and his wife where I put up happened, unfortunately for me, to be acquainted
     with my brother and sister; and finding by the discourse that I was a relation of theirs, and
     going to visit them, the landlady presently said she would endeavour to get me a bed; and,
     going out of the kitchen, she quickly called me into a parlour that led from it.  Here I saw,
     sitting by the fire, a middle-aged man, in a nightgown and cap, who was reckoning money at a
     table.  ‘Uncle,’ said the woman, as soon as I entered, ‘this is a brother of our friend, Mrs.
     Sawyer; he cannot get a bed anywhere, and is tired after his journey.  You are the only one
     that lies in this house alone: will you give him a part of your’s?’  To this the man answered,
     that she knew he had been out of order,—that he was blooded that day,
     <pb n="7"/>and consequently a bedfellow could not be very agreeable.  ‘However,’ said he,
     ‘rather than the young man shall sit up, he is welcome to sleep with me.’  After this, we sat
     some time together; when, having put his money in a canvas bag into the pocket of his
     nightgown, he took the candle, and I followed him up to bed.”</p>
    <p>Having occasion to visit the garden during the night, the landlord lent him his pen-knife,
     that he might more easily open the door, the latch being broken.  From this knife a piece of
     money falls, which Gwinett pockets.  Returning to his room, he finds, to his great surprize,
     that his companion is absent.  At six o’clock he rises, dresses himself hastily, and, impatient
     to see his sister (the reckoning being paid overnight), lets himself out at the street
     door.</p>
    <p>He has not been above an hour or two with his relations, before three horsemen arrive, arrest
     him for robbery and murder, and he is carried back to Deal, to be dealt with accordingly.</p>
    <p>He is taken with the knife in his possession, tried, condemned, and executed: yet, strange to
     say, the man yet lived; his groans were heard from the gibbet, and he was rescued from his
     frightful situation by his master’s dairymaid.  He took ship, went abroad, and encountered
     Collins, the supposed victim, who, it appeared, had been forced from his home by a press-gang. 
     After enduring many perils, he returned to his native land, crippled and poor, and subsequently
     became sweeper of the road at Charing Cross.</p>
    <p>Mr. Jerrold has heightened the interest of his drama by superadding the passions of love and
     jealousy.  We have no objection to fiction when it conduces to effect; and three rounds of
     applause are sufficient to justify any interpolation.  This piece was well acted, and brought
     ample receipts to the treasury of the Coburg.</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  Softly, master Collins, softly,—come, there is life in you yet, man.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Col.</speaker>
      <p>  To be thrown from a horse after my experience—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  Oh, the best man may be thrown, and the best horse throw too; but come, you have no bones
       broken.  Had any man but myself, Ned Grayling, shoed your horse, I should have said something
       had been amiss with his irons—but that couldn’t be.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Col.</speaker>
      <p>  No matter, I can now make my way homeward: but, hark’ye, not a word about this accident,
       not a syllable, or I shall never be able to sit in a saddle again, without first hearing a
       lecture from my wife and Lucy.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  Lucy—aye, master Collins, she has a tender heart I warrant—I could work at my forge all
       day in the hottest June, so that Lucy would but smile, when—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Col.</speaker>
      <p>  There must be no more of this.  You know I have told you more than a hundred times that
       Lucy cannot love you.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  How do you know that?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Col.</speaker>
      <p>  She has said so, and do you suppose she would speak any thing but truth?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  Why, perhaps she would, and perhaps she wouldn’t.  I tell you, master Collins, my heart’s
       set upon the girl—if she refuse me—why I know the end on’t.—Ned Grayling, once the sober and
       industrious smith, will become an outcast and a vagabond.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Col.</speaker>
      <p>  This is all folly—a stout able fellow turning whimperer.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  Stout, able,—yes, I was, and might be so again; but thoughts will sometimes come across
       me, and I feel—I tell you once more, master Collins, my heart is set upon the girl.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Col.</speaker>
      <p>  You’ll get the better of this, think no more of her: nothing so easy.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  There are some matters very, <emph>very</emph> easy.  It is easy for you, a man well in
       trade, with children flourishing about you, and all the world looking with a sunny face upon
       you—it is easy for you to say to a man like me,
       <pb n="16"/>“You are poor and friendless—you have placed your affections on a being, to
       sweeten the bitterness of your lot, to cheer and bless you on the road of life, yet she can
       never be yours—think no more of her,” this is easy—“nothing so easy.”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Col.</speaker>
      <p>  Farewell, good fellow, I meant not to insult or offend you.  If you can obtain my niece’s
       consent, why, to prove that I love honesty, for its own sake, I’ll give you whatever help my
       means afford.  If, however, the girl refuses, strive to forget her.  Believe me, there is
       scarcely a more pitiable object than a man following with spaniel-like humility, the woman
       who despises him.</p>
      <stage>[Exit L.</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  Despises!—did she ever say,—no! no! she couldn’t, yet when I met her last, though she
       uttered not a sound, her eyes looked hate—as they flashed upon me, I felt humbled—a wretch! a
       very worm.</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter Gilbert R.  <stage>(singing.)</stage>  “A merry little plough Boy.”</stage>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  Well, now master’s gone out, I think I have a little time to see my Jenny—master and
       mistress have no compassion for us lovers—always work, work; they think once a week is quite
       enough for lovers to see one another, and unfortunately my fellow servant is in love as well
       as I am; and being obliged to keep house, I could only get out once a fortnight, if it wasn’t
       for Lucy.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  <stage>(starting.)</stage>  Lucy! who said any thing about Lucy?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  I did!  It’s a good Christian name, isn’t it? and no treason in it.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  No, no, but you startled me.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  I should like to know what right a man has to be startled when I say Lucy—why one would
       think you were married, and it was the name of your wife.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  Lucy my wife, no, no.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  No, I should think not indeed.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  And why should you think? but I’m wrong to be so passionate—think no more of it, good
       Gilbert.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  A cool way of settling matters: you first fly at a man like a dragon—make his heart jump
       like a tennis ball—and then say, think nothing of it, good Gilbert.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  I confess I am very foolish.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  Oh, spare your confession: people will judge for themselves.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  <stage>(aside.)</stage>  I am almost ashamed to do it, yet I will.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  Why, what’s the matter? you are looking at
       <pb n="17"/>me as if, like a highwayman, you were considering which pocket I carried my money
       in.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  Pray, good Gilbert, tell me, do you know whether Miss Lucy has any admirers?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  Admirers! to be sure she has.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  She has!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  Hundreds—don’t the whole town admire her? don’t all our customers say pretty things to
       her? don’t I admire her? and hav’n’t I seen you looking at her?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  Looking at her!—how?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  How, why like a dog that had once been well kicked, and was afraid of being known a
       second time.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  Villain! do you make mirth of my sufferings? am I sport for fools? answer my question, or
       I’ll shake your soul out on the wind—tell me—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  If the fox had never ventured where he had no business, he’d have kept his tail.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  What mean you?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>  If you had minded your own affairs, you’d not have lost your temper.</p>

       a minute; the house is full of customers, and it threatens to be a boisterous night.</p>

      <p>  Aye; Ned is not so sprightly and trim a lad as many, but he hath that which makes all in

       upon this theme—at least for the present.  I will explain all to-morrow, will prove to you
       that my aversion is not the result of idle caprice, but of feelings which you yourself must
       sanction.  In the mean while be assured I would rather go down into my grave, than wed with

      <p>  Those, master Grayling, who do not let their hate stand in the light of their clear
       judgment.  This is, I warrant me, a rare day of triumph for you.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  Aye, and ought to be to every honest man! ’tis for rogues to be sad, when rogues are

       you! hates you as much as she loves—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  Her uncle’s murderer, eh? are not those the words? with all my heart, I would rather have
       the deadly hate of Lucy Fairlove, than the softest pity of Lucy Gwinett.  Oh! I thought there
       was a world of mischief under the smooth face of the assassin—had he struck for a deep
       revenge I could have pardoned him, for it might have been my own fate—but to murder a man for
       gold! for a few pieces of shining dross—’tis a crime to feel one touch of pity for so base a
       miscreant.</p>

      <p>  Aye, it was but yesterday when the gay trim master Ambrose scorned and contemned me! but
       yesterday, and Lucy hung upon his arm! and to-day—ha! ha! ha!—I stood against him at the
       fatal bar; as I passed, his brow blackened, and his lips worked—his eyes shot the lightnings
       of hate upon me—at that moment my heart beat with a wild delight, and I smiled to see how the
       criminal shrunk as I told the tale that damn’d him—to see him recoil as though every word I
       uttered fell like a withering fire upon his guilty heart.  <stage>(A scream is heard from the

     <sp>
      <speaker>Black.</speaker>
      <p>  Satisfy! why you may be satisfied—the men who killed Collins, doubtless did it for his

      <p>  No, then it would be fools, upon whom fortune had thrown away her favours—Collins is

      <p>  Poor Ambrose Gwinett—you are mightily compassionate, master Bolt.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bolt.</speaker>
      <p>  Why, for the matter of that, if a man’s a gaoler, I see no reason why his heart should be
       of a piece with the prison wall.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  But is he not an assassin?—a midnight murderer?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bolt.</speaker>
      <p>  True; and yet I cannot but doubt—I do not think a man with blood upon his head, could
       sleep so soundly and smile so in his slumbers, as does master Gwinett; the whole country
       feels for him.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  Aye, it is the fashion now-a-days—let a knave only rob an orchard, and he’s whipped and
       cried at for a villain—let him spill blood, and it’s marvellous the compassion that awaits
       him.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bolt.</speaker>
      <p>  Why, how now, master Grayling? once you would not have talked in this manner—you had one
       time a heart as tender as a girl’s—I have seen you drop a tear upon the hand of a prisoner,
       as you have fitted the iron upon it.  Methinks you are strangely changed of late.</p>

       arm before you measure it—stronger men than you, I take it, have tried in
       vain.—<stage>(Grayling takes hold of George’s arm, and with a slight effort, bends
       it.)</stage>  Ah! there was but one man who could do this—he who did it when a boy—surely you

      <speaker>Geo.</speaker>
      <p>  Nay, Grayling, this is weak—your task is not a free one, ’tis, I know, imposed upon
       you—to the work, and whilst you measure the limbs of mad George, the felon, think not, for I

       bliss—and cast, bound, and fettered within a prison’s walls—and my name—my innocent name,
       stamped in the book of infamy—oh! was man to contemplate at one view the evil he’s to suffer,
       madness would seize on half his kind—but misery, day by day works on, laying at intervals

       crowd upon me—that meadow!—many a summer’s night have I with my little sisters, sat waiting
       my father’s coming—and when he turned that hedge, to see his eyes, how they kindled up, when

      <p>  Happiness—alas, no; my very dreams are but a counterpart of my waking horrors.—Last
       night, harassed, I threw me down to rest—a leaden slumber fell upon me, and then I dreamt,
       Lucy, that thou and I had at the altar sworn a lasting faith.</p>

       by happy friends, and thou smilest—oh, my heart beat quickly with transporting joy, as with
       one hand clasping thine, I strove to place the ring upon thy finger—it fell—and ringing on
       the holy floor, shivered like glass into a thousand atoms—astonished, I gazed a moment on the
       glittering
       <pb n="40"/>fragments,—but when I raised my head, thou wert not to be found—the place had
       changed—the bridal train had vanished, and in its stead, I saw surrounding thousands, who,
       with upturned eyes, gazed like spectres on me—I looked for the priest, and in his place stood
       glaring at me with a savage joy, the executioner—I strove to burst away—my arms were bound—I
       cast my eyes imploringly to heaven—and there above me was the beam—the fatal beam—I felt my

     <stage>Enter Gilbert and Jenny, as landlord and landlady.  L.</stage>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  I tell thee, Jenny, I can’t help it; ever as this day comes round, I’m melancholy, spite
       of reasoning.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
      <p>  Well, well; but it’s so long ago.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  But not the less to be remembered—it is now eighteen years this very day, since poor
       Ambrose Gwinett died the death of a murderer!—I’m sure he was innocent—I’d lay my life on
       it.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
      <p>  But there’s no occasion to be so violent.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  I tell you I can’t think with calmness and speak on it.  A fine open hearted youth, and
       see the end of it.  Not one of his accusers but is come to shame.  Look at Grayling—Ned
       Grayling the smith—don’t good folks shake the head, and the little children point at him as
       he goes by—and then those two churls who scoffed at him, as he was on the road to death—has
       either of them had a good crop since?—havn’t their cattle died?—their haystacks took
       fire—with all kinds of mischief falling on them?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
      <p>  Yes, and poor Lucy.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  And there again; Lucy, Gwinett’s widow, though almost broken hearted—doesn’t she keep a
       cheerful face, and look smilingly—whilst her husband’s accusers are ashamed to shew their
       heads—I say again, I know he was innocent.  I know the true murderers will some day be
       brought to light.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
      <p>  I’m sure I hope they will; but in the mean time, we musn’t stand talking about it, or no
       one will come to the Blake’s Head.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  Well, well; I leave it all to you to day, Jenny: I’m not fit to attend to the customers. 
       Ah! good fortune
       <pb n="43"/>has been showered upon us—little did we think of seeing ourselves owners of this
       house; but I’m sure I’d walk out of it with a light heart, if it’s old owner, poor Robert
       Collins, could but come back to take possession of it—but that’s impossible, so we’ll talk no
       more of it.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
      <p>  Well I declare this is all waste of time—we’ve the house full of customers, and here
       we’re standing talking as—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  You know we used to do Jenny, some eighteen years ago; then I was waiter and ostler here,
       and you were dairy maid at squire—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
      <p>  Well that’s all past, where is the use of looking back.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  A great deal: when a man gets to the top of the hill by honest industry, I say he
       deserves to be taken by the neck and hurled down again, if he’s ashamed to turn about and
       look at the lowly road along which he once travelled.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
      <p>  Well, I didn’t mean that.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  No no, I know you meant no harm, Jenny—but you will talk—well I shall go and take a
       round.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
      <p>  You’re going to the meadow, at One-Tree-Farm to mope yourself to death.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  Why perhaps I may take a turn that way—but I shall be back soon—eh! who’s this?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
      <p>  Why it’s the servant of the rich old gentleman, from the Indies.</p>

      <p>  Yes—hope your master slept well—I wasn’t at home last night when you put up, or I should
       have paid my respects:—he’s from India I hear.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>  From India!—and as rich, and as liberal as an emperor.</p>

      <p>  Some twelve years.</p>
     </sp>

      <p>  Has he any friends in these parts?</p>

      <p>  He had when he left, or rather when he was dragged from this country, some eighteen years
       ago.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
      <p>  Dragged from the country!</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>Label.</speaker>
      <p>  Yes pressed—he was taken on board ship at dead of night; the vessel weighed anchor at daybreak—
       <pb n="44"/>started for India—and there my master, what with one and another piece of luck,
       got his discharge: but I believe he wishes to see you.</p>

       murdered—alive and flourishing in India—poor Gwinett—poor Ambrose—I have never had the
       courage to tell my master that sad story—he little thinks that an innocent man has been
       hanged on his account—somehow I wish I had told him—and yet what would have been the use; he
       couldn’t have brought the dead man alive again, and it would only have made him miserable. 
       But now he can’t long escape hearing the whole tale, and then what will become of me—no
       matter; I must put a bright face upon the business, and trust to chances.</p>

      <p>  No, no; to your story.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  I was about to say it was eighteen years since the last execution for murder happened in
       these parts.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gwin.</speaker>
      <p>  And the culprit’s name was—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  <stage>(fiercely.)</stage>  Gwinett—Ambrose Gwinett—ha! ha!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gwin.</speaker>
      <p>  Were there not, if I remember rightly, some doubts of Gwinett’s guilt?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  Doubts!—There might have been among those who are touched with a demure look; but no, he
       was guilty—guilty of the murder—and I saw him die the death of an assassin.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gwin.</speaker>
      <p>  Pray was not part of his sentence by some means evaded?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  It was.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gwin.</speaker>
      <p>  I have heard but a confused account of the transaction.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  <stage>(eagerly.)</stage>  I can tell you the whole—every word of it.  He was sentenced
       to be hung in chains—another that was to suffer with him, was pardoned; so the murderer died
       alone.  Never shall I forget the morning.—Though eighteen years ago, it is now as fresh in my
       memory as though it was the work of yesterday: I saw the last convulsive struggle of the
       murderer—nay, I assisted in rivetting the irons on the corse—’twas hung at the destined spot;
       but, when the morning came, the body was not there.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gwin.</speaker>
      <p>  Was no enquiry instituted?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  Yes; it was supposed the relations of the murderer had stolen the body to give it burial:
       the murderer’s uncle, and wife were examined—but after a time, no further stir was
       made.—Curse upon the trick, it cost me my bread.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gwin.</speaker>
      <p>  How so?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gray.</speaker>
      <p>  Why I was the prison-smith—had the irons fitted the corse, it must have been cut to
       pieces, ’ere it could have been removed.</p>

       stolen for interment.—Listen, I knew your husband—met him abroad: to me, he confided the

       agonies of death!  The dreadful ordeal past, the ministers of justice executed the remaining
       part of the sentence—the body was suspended in chains.  Whether it was from the inexperience
       of the executioner, or the hurried manner in which the sad tragedy was performed, I know
       not,—but your husband still lived—the fresh airs of night blew upon him, and he
       revived—revived and found himself hanging.—Oh! my blood thickens as I think upon the torture
       that was his—fortunately, the irons that supported him, hung loosely about him; by a slight
       effort he freed his limbs, and dropping to the earth, hastened with all speed, to another
       part of the coast, took ship and quitted England.</p>

       sold for a slave—I knew him whilst a captive.</p>

      <speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
      <p>  And did he die in slavery—oh, your looks declare it—unhappy wretched Gwinett,—but no,
       happy, thrice happy, he died not on a scaffold.  Did he hope you would ever see his miserable
       widow?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gwin.</speaker>
      <p>  He did, and gave me this locket—it contains your hair.</p>

      <speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
      <p>  Oh, give it me—oh, well do I remember when I saw it last, Gwinett was gazing at it with

       am happy.</p>
