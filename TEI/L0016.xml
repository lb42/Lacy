   <performance>
    <p>First produced at the Royal Adelphi Theatre, Monday June 3rd, 1850.</p>
    <p>And taken altogether from the French, in accordance with the Fashion of the time.</p>
   </performance>
   <div type="liminal">
    <p>After sitting up several nights last week, and reading through many centuries of Play-bills
     and volumes of Joke-books, the author finds that the period has at length arrived, when it is
     utterly impossible to make any fresh facetious remarks upon the intelligent artists engaged in
     getting up the Piece. The author therefore trusts</p>
    <p>That Mr. PITT will forgive him when he simply states, that the Scenery has been taken by him
     from the best authorities of Dulaure and Callot with singularly effective tact and
     arrangement:</p>
    <p>That Mr. ALFRED MELLON will not feel hurt at finding attributed to him the arrangement only,
     of Airs selected from the original Ballet of Esmeralda, Le Huguenots, Le Prophete, Masaniello,
     La Favorita, Alma, Norma, and all sorts of Organs, Jetty Treffz, Henry Phillips, The Cider
     Cellars, Jullien, and many other sources, being well aware of his own innate talent for
     composing:</p>
    <p>That Mr. SMITHYES and Miss RAYNER will believe that he is deeply sensible of the research
     they have displayed in collecting the Authorities for the charming Costumes with which the
     deliverers of his ideas have been clothed:</p>
    <p>That Messrs. T. IRELAND and FOSTER will acquit him of inattention in not tacking allusive
     jests to their calling, and playing upon any words connected with the Properties generally,
     which have been so intelligently furnished:</p>
    <p>That Mr. COOPER will hold him guiltless, in like manner, of a wish to offend, in omitting the
     usual humourous jokes about the Machinery; and, finally,</p>
    <p>That MADAME CELESTE will not consider him less conscious of her unwearying energy and
     invention in directing the Mise en Scene, when he simply states that everything has been
     produced under her direction.</p>
