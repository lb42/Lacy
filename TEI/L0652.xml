<head>Act I.</head>

<div type="scene">
<head>Scene first.</head>
<stage> — A handsome Apartment in Brummell's House. </stage>
<stage>Isidore discovered, in chair, looking over his master's toilette table,
R. Two Women removing a bath. </stage>
<sp who="#L0652_M13">
<speaker>Woman.</speaker>
<p>Twenty shirts a-week, twenty-four pocket- hankercheys, to say noting of
thirty crawats and twelve waistcits—indeed, for people as can’t pay their
servants ! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M2">
<speaker>Isidore.</speaker>
<p>Gently with the water. <stage>Exit Women, L.</stage></p>
<p>Well, he owes me just six thousand three hundred and thirty-seven francs, ten
sous. <stage>(picks up paper)</stage>Ah, I see. I’m in the list. It costs
something to have the honour of serving Mr. Brummell—to be chamberlain to His
Majesty the King of Calais! But he is a wonderful man! People almost thank him
for condescending to be in their debt ; still, much as I esteem the honour, I
can’t afford it any longer, nor can the laundress nor can the hairdresser. Eight
hundred francs a-year for washing ! Three clean shirts a day—three cravats!
Boots blacked soles and all, <stage>(shews them) </stage>and with such varnish!
But then he has such exquisite taste ! why he blackballed a friend of his who
wanted to enter his club, because the candidate’s boots were polished with bad
blacking I wonder whether the king will do anything for him ? <stage>(ring at
bell)</stage>That’s Mr. Copy, no doubt. We must come to business at once, for it
wants only ten minutes to Mr. Brummell‘s dressing hour. <stage>Exit Isidore,
L.</stage></p>
<stage> Re-enter Isidore followed by Copy, L.</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M4">
<speaker>Copy.</speaker>
<p>Exactly so; we’ll come to business at once. I want him to write his life and
correspondence, as you know. He has got some telling letters about him:—scandal
in high life—always sells. Let me only see him, and I’ll come round him. Would
five hundred pounds tempt him ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M2">
<speaker>Isid.</speaker>
<p>Five hundred pounds! I don’t know; he has such sums at times. Anyway make it
as heavy as you can. <pb n="4"/> He’s an expensive gentleman; and I will say
this for him, he pays when he’s got the money. It takes two glovers to make him
a pair of gloves, one for the fingers and one for the thumb.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M4">
<speaker>Copy.</speaker>
<p><stage>(looking about room and holding note book, aside) </stage>} Wonderful!
and so he dresses here, does he ? Ah! pretty place! <stage>(makes a note)
</stage>Furnished regardless of expense— in the first style! <stage>(glances at
dressing table) </stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M2">
<speaker>Isid.</speaker>
<p>You mustn't approach the dressing table; it’s a sacred spot.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M4">
<speaker>Copy.</speaker>
<p><stage>(aside, in note book) </stage>Wears a wig.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M2">
<speaker>Isid.</speaker>
<p>Well call this afternoon, and I’ll manage to get you an interview. He’s
going to have some of the king’s suite with him, I believe; they’ll land soon,
we expect so you’d better be off to the port, to see the sight.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M4">
<speaker>Copy.</speaker>
<p>I mustn’t miss that, make a capital opening chapter, “The sun had scarce
begun to gild,'” &amp;c. Good-bye, my friend—this afternoon then.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M2">
<speaker>Isid.</speaker>
<p>Hush!—Quick! It’s Mr. Brummell. Here !— you cannot get out. If he were to
see you here he’d throw you out of the window. I hear his footstep. Quick
—behind the door, and keep quiet till he is before the glass, When you see him
take up the silver tweezers slip out; for nothing will distract him then.
Hush!</p>
<stage> Enter Brummell, L., letter in hand, Isidore busies himself piling
cravats upon the side of dressing table, and wheels chair to glass. Brummell
leisurely walks to table, and throws himself in a chair before the glass—takes
up the cravats and examines them, throws two or three away. </stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M1">
<speaker>Brum.</speaker>
<p>Isidore, take those dusters away—the chamber maid has forgotten them.</p>
<p><stage>(Isidore picks them up as Brummel draws his chair close to the
glass)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M4">
<speaker>Copy.</speaker>
<p><stage>(putting head out)</stage>Wonderful details! flowered chintz dressing
gown! white hand!</p>
<p><stage>(Brummell picks up tweezers)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M2">
<speaker>Isid.</speaker>
<p><stage>(aside to Copy)</stage>Now then—be off!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M4">
<speaker>Copy.</speaker>
<p><stage>(with note book)</stage>Silver tweezers, by Jingo! <stage>(goes out, L.,
making a note)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M1">
<speaker>Brum.</speaker>
<p><stage>(puts down tweezers , and re-reads letter, snuffs, opening and closing
the box with left hand) </stage>Strange girl this—the only thing I know against
her is, that she takes <pb n="5"/> soup twice. It’s the old story. Her father
wants her to marry a fellow who can keep her, and she wants to have a young
fellow who can’t. Well, the young fellow who can't is the more interesting of
the two. I must ask the father to dinner I suppose—it’s a deuced bore; but it
will put him under a heavy obligation. I must make excuses to Ballarat and Gill.
<stage>(rises and takes his coat off ; and prepares elaborately to
dress—proceeds with toilet as dialogue goes on., first going over his face with
a mirror and tweezers, then having his wig on, then turning the shirt collar (an
immense one)</stage>up, and turning it over—dexterously holding his head far
back, places cravat, draws down his chin to give it the proper crease —fails
with four or five —uses all kinds of preparations , puts on shawl waistcoat,
snuff-coloured surcoat, with velvet collar, has dark blue trousers, and the most
exquisitely polished pointed boots, which he examines before he puts them on)}
Isidore when I’m dressed take my compliments to Mr. Davis, and tell him I shall
be happy to see him at dinner to-day.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M2">
<speaker>Isid.</speaker>
<p>Very well, sir. <stage>(aside)</stage>To Davis, a retired fellow from the
city! This is a tumble!—I am sorry to trouble you sir, but— </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M1">
<speaker>Brum.</speaker>
<p>I can’t talk to you to-day, Isidore. Give me a cravat.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M2">
<speaker>Isid.</speaker>
<p><stage>(handing one) </stage>I am a poor man, and six thousand francs—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M1">
<speaker>Brum.</speaker>
<p>I understand, Isidore. We’ll see—we’ll see; don’t disturb me. <stage>(second
cravat fails—throws it away) </stage>} Zounds ! man, haven't you been long
enough with me to know that these are not moments when I can speak or listen?
Give me another, <stage>(gives a third cravat, bell rings) </stage>} If that be
Mr. Fotherby, show him in. <stage>Exit Isidore L. </stage>I intend to form that
young fellow—there’s stuff in him. I’ve noticed that he uses my blacking.
<stage>(Brummell. has thrown his head back, and is leisurely creasing his
cravat, as enter Fotherby followed by Isidore, L., without distracting his
attention — Isidore hushes Fotherby not to speak— this cravat succeeds , and
when Brummell has folded it, he turns his head slightly)</stage>How d’e do,
Fotherby?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M7">
<speaker>Fother.</speaker>
<p>This admittance is an honour indeed, sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M1">
<speaker>Brum.</speaker>
<p><stage>(fixing his eyes upon Fotherby’s feet) </stage>My dear fellow, why, what
do you call those things upon your feet?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M7">
<speaker>Fother.</speaker>
<p>Things on my feet ! Shoes, to be sure !</p>
<pb n="6"/>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M1">
<speaker>Brum.</speaker>
<p><stage>(turning contemptuously to toilet table)</stage>Shoes! I thought they
were slippers!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M7">
<speaker>Fother.</speaker>
<p>You prefer boots then, sir, doubtless?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M1">
<speaker>Brum.</speaker>
<p><stage>(without turning) </stage>Well, let me see, Humph! Isidore, which do I
prefer, boots or shoes?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M2">
<speaker>Isid.</speaker>
<p>The Hessian was always your favourite, sir, in London.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M1">
<speaker>Brum.</speaker>
<p>Right, Isidore—so it was. By-the-bye, <stage>(Brummell continues his toilet)
</stage>I have asked Davis here to-day. It was a great sacrifice ; but as you
and the young lady want to have the old gentleman melted, I resigned myself. I
hope he’ll keep his knife out of his mouth.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M7">
<speaker>Fother.</speaker>
<p>We shall be eternally grateful to you, sir. He wanted Helen to become old
Armand’ s wife next week.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M1">
<speaker>Brum.</speaker>
<p>I think he’s right; and but for one circumstance, I should be on Armand’ s
side of the question.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M7">
<speaker>Fother.</speaker>
<p>And this circumstance?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M1">
<speaker>Brum.</speaker>
<p>The brute has a toothpick in his waistcoat pocket, or in the thing that
serves him for a waistcoat—an instrument that, he says, has been in his family
the last fifty years. Conceive, my dear Fotherby, an hereditary toothpick! No,
Mr. Davis does not deserve that fate. <stage>(takes up handkerchief) </stage>And
now let me give you a bit of advice. Never wear perfumes, but fine linen, plenty
of it, and country washing. Look at you now, my good fellow, you are dressed in
execrable taste—all black and white, like a magpie, Still, never be remarkable.
The severest mortification a gentleman can incur, is to attract observation in
the street by his dress. <stage>(puts on his coat)</stage>Every thing should fit
without a fault. You can’t tell what this has cost me—but then it is a
coat—while that thing you wear— <stage>(examining Fotherby)</stage>I really
don't know what we can call it.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M7">
<speaker>Fother.</speaker>
<p>Still, sir, under your guidance I shall improve. By the way, my mother asked
me to invite you to take tea with us in our humble way.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M1">
<speaker>Brum.</speaker>
<p><stage>(as he puts on yellow gloves, and surprised) </stage>Really, my good
young friend, you surprise me. Don’t you know that you take medicine—you take a
walk— you take a liberty—but you <hi>drink</hi> tea! My dear Fotherby, never be
bearer of such a dreadful message again, <stage>(puts his hat carefully on the
side of his head)</stage> And now, Fotherby <pb n="7"/>to show you how deep an
interest I take in your welfare, you shall give me your arm to the ramparts.
<stage> They are going, L.— cannon in distance —faint cheers </stage></p>
<stage>Landlord rushes on. L.</stage>

<p>Monsieur Brummell ! Monsieur Brummell !</p>

<p>Well, sir!</p>
</sp>

<p>The king has arrived!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M1">
<speaker>Brum.</speaker>
<p><stage>(coolly) </stage>That is hardly interesting to me: we don’t speak,
<stage>Crosses and exeunt with Fotherby, L.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M10">
<speaker>Landlord.</speaker>
<p>Isidore your master is a very great man.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M2">
<speaker>Isid.</speaker>
<p>I hope so; he has cost me six thousand francs. Well, as I and Smalls do
speak, I’ll run down and see if he’s in the suite, giving Davis his message by
the way. Your servant, monsieur. Davis dining with Mr. Brummell! Well, I never
thought he would come to that. In Chesterfield Street such a man wouldn’t have
been allowed to do duty as a dumb waiter.</p>
<stage> Exit Isidore, L., followed by Landlord.</stage>
</sp>
</div>
<div type="scene">
<head>Scene Second. — Street in Calais. </head>
<stage> Enter Smalls, R., with a cocked hat box in his hand. </stage>
<sp who="#L0652_M8">
<speaker>Smalls.</speaker>
<p>Well, of all the dirty, vulgar places I ever stopped into, this Calais is
the worst. How poor Isidore manages, even with the cheap brandy, to support
existence, is a subjick of wonder. I should like to hunt him up too, and hear
how the famous Mr. Brummell jogs on. A feller that spoke writched English—even
after having lived a whole year in England, told me it was hereabouts.
<stage>(looking off L.)</stage>Why that must be him. Trim as ever ; but with a
sad aspick, denoting a mind ill at ease.</p>
<stage> Enter Isidore, L.</stage>
<p>What Isidore!! How are you. <stage>(they shake hands)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M2">
<speaker>Isid.</speaker>
<p>My dear Smalls —well —as well as I can hope to be under the circumstances.
This isn‘t Chesterfield Street !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M8">
<speaker>Smalls.</speaker>
<p>Chesterfield Street—Holbing beats it! And so you don't like the
<hi>mounseers—</hi> nor the French ladies— nor the brandy! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M2">
<speaker>Isid.</speaker>
<p>Nothing. It isn’t a place for a gentleman.</p>
<p>Smalls I was just saying to myself, I shouldn’t like to fold my wings within
a hundred miles of it. And Mr. Brummell ?</p>
<pb n="8"/>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M2">
<speaker>Isid.</speaker>
<p>Ah! times have changed. I have to do his hair all alone now; in Chesterfield
Street, we had two hairdressers—one for the front, and one for the back of the
head.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M8">
<speaker>Smalls.</speaker>
<p>He was a great swell. And so you had a dull time of it here?—I should say as
much. London for me!—I wouldn’t miss a season in London for anythink.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M2">
<speaker>Isid.</speaker>
<p>Yes, and then we had an artist to design the folds of his cravat;—now we
dress alone. Oh! better be plain Mr. Brummell in Chesterfield Street, than King
of Calais!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M8">
<speaker>Smalls.</speaker>
<p>King of Calais—Ha! ha! that ain’t bad. But he looks uncommon well still, I
hear.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0652_M2">
<speaker>Isid.</speaker>
<p><stage>(indignantly) </stage>Well <hi>still!</hi> Smalls, <hi>your</hi> master
may still consider it a precious honour I can tell you, to be seen arm-in-arm
with him. It’s a pity, however, Mr. Brummell will condescend to know some of the
people he does know here. I can’t mix with them. Why he actually dined the other
day with a man who mixes his own salad; and here am I going to ask a fellow
named Davis to dine. I’m ashamed of myself. But here they come ! the Beau

to fall back. That’s what I call linige. Come along—I saw “ <hi>Eau de Vie
