    <stage type="setting">SCENE.—A handsomely furnished apartment—Doors, R. and L.—Fireplace, C.—A
     fire laid but not lighted—window, C. looking on open country—piano, R. open—Breakfast laid for
     two.</stage>

    <stage>Enter Hannah, L. D. carrying two dishes—over her arm hang a brace of pheasants.</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Han.</speaker>
     <p>There's the birds <stage>(placing them on side table)</stage> as has just come; and there's
      the breakfast. <stage>(placing dishes)</stage> Why, good gracious! where's the 'am? I'm sure I
      put the 'am upon the table. <stage>(she stands before table)</stage> Now that's very strange.
      As sure as love is loss of appetite that 'am this 'and placed upon that table—I'd lay my best
      new gown on it! When I went into the kitchen for the hot hamlet and the cold grouse-pie, I
      says to myself, “Master has gone out for his constitution, but missus will be down directly,
      so hup with the hamlet, cook, my dear, this instant!” and cook turns round from the fire and
      says to me, “Hannah,” says she—<stage>(leaves table open to the sight of the Audience—the pie
      has disappeared —she screams)</stage> The pie's gone! The place is bewitched! Ghosts is in the
      'ouse, and I give warning as sure as Dreams and Death-watches. <stage>(she sits against table,
      leaning her head on her hand so as to hide the omelette)</stage> I never stirred from the
      spot. No thief could done it—I see none! The 'am and the pie 'as both gone off together! What
      will missus say? She won't believe me! She'll think I've give it to Berlinns. I stay in no
      house which is haunted, and so I'll tell the cook. They was a murder committed in the next
      county but one only four
      <pb n="4"/>years ago—and 'ams and pies don't disappear for nothing. <stage>turns round and
      finds the omelette gone—screams and throws her apron over head)</stage> </p>

    <note place="foot">It is essential that the Audience should not see these things conveyed under

     <speaker>Han.</speaker>
     <p>Who got the hamlet!</p>

     <p>He's took the pie!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>The ghost in Hamlet took a pie! Why, you silly girl, you're mad!</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Han.</speaker>
     <p>Missus, the 'ouse is 'aunted!</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>Ridiculous!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Han.</speaker>
     <p>And the pie and the 'am has gone the way of all flesh!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Han.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (crying)</stage>I lay breakfast this morning—ham— biled eggs—oh, he's got them too!
      I leave the room to fetch the pie and hamlet—when I comes back the eggs and 'am is gone
      together. I stops in the room, my eyes fixed on that there table and never took 'em off, no
      never —not to look about me. The pie goes—vanishes!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>The grouse-pie?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Han.</speaker>
     <p>“Into thin hare,” as I read in a book the other day. I sit down, and under my eyes, before
      my very nose, quick! bang!—the hamlet goes, too!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>Hamlet's ghost—where to?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Han.</speaker>
     <p>Don't joke, missus, please—my nerves shakes like aspens quiver.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>It's very strange! Wait till your master   comes home and tell him all about it. Bring in
      the coffee.</p>

     <p>It'll go, too, mum.</p>

     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>There—go and fetch it. <stage>  Exit Hannah, L. D.</stage> What plagues servants are! Though

    <stage>Hannah enters with coffee, she puts it on table.</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Han.</speaker>
     <p>Mind it, mum, or the ghost will fetch it.</p>

     <p>Such nonsense! Mr. Boodle gone out for a walk?</p>

     <p>Yes, m---take care on it. Ah!</p>

     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>Make some fresh coffee for him.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Han.</speaker>
     <p>I will, mum, 'cos you'll want it yourself—that'll soon go. Hold it tight, mum—don't let go
      on it.<stage>  Exit Hannah, L. watching coffee.</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>Was ever such absurdity! Perhaps some thief has got into the pantry, or this is only an
      excuse.</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>  (Charles rises from behind the table, and seats himself in the chair opposite Mrs.
     Boodle. As she fills her cup, he takes it from her. She takes the sugar-tongs —he places
     remains of omelette on table.</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>Sugar, please—two lumps. <stage>(Mrs. Boodle rises alarmed at seeing a strange man—Charles's
      clothes are torn and splashed all over—his boots muddy—his hat smashed—his hair uncombed, and
      his entire appearance of the most vagabond order.—He follows her as she retreats towards the
      hall, trying to embrace her—at last he takes her in his arms, and kisses her—She is about to
      scream, he puts his hand over her mouth)</stage> Don't scream, nor pull the bell!</p>

     <p>My dear sister! I'm so delighted to see you, that with your permission I'll take a cup of

     <p>Yes—been there these two hours!</p>

     <p>Oh, Charley! I'm afraid you've been up to some of your tricks again, and have been forced to
      leave Cambridge.</p>

     <p><stage> (laying down his knife and fork suddenly)</stage>Don't!</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>So you have been under the table the last two hours, have you? just like you—always playing
      tricks; and I suppose you are the ghost that that stupid Hannah has been talking about?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>  Precisely!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>And you have been conveying all the eatables under the table.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>And thence under my waistcoat.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>Your appetite then still continues to be as enormous as ever.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>Worse, just now! I've eaten nothing these two days.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, Charley?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>Fact! the last meal of which this child partook was breakfast with a St. John's man, the
      morning before yesterday.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>You must be very hungry!</p>

     <p>I <hi>was</hi>—look here! <stage>(pulling table cloth up and showing the remains of what he
      conveyed under the table— a picked ham bone, &amp;c.)</stage> There are the dead
      men—<hi>picked</hi> men, I should say—like the crew of our four oar. <stage>(putting down
      cup)</stage> There! I've done. I never made a better breakfast! <stage>(he rises)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <pb n="7"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>I should think not! but, my dear Charley, what an awful figure you look! what a dreadful
      state your clothes are in!</p>

     <p>Allude to that again!</p>

     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>I dare say it is!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>It wants a brush.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>I should think it did—considering it has never been touched for two days.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>What?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>Nor my face washed—nor my hands— <stage>(showing them awfully dirty)</stage> nor my boots
      blacked—nor my collar changed.</p>

     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean?</p>

     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>This manly form, and these ungentle<hi>manly</hi> habiliments have been guiltless of
      toilette since Wednesday last at eight o'clock, a.m.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>I can't understand you! You have never seen my husband—he'll be delighted to be introduced
      to you.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>Will he? then I must deprive him of that pleasure. He musn't know that I am here.</p>

     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>Not know that—do explain, Charley?</p>

     <p>Don't! <stage>(imitating him)</stage> Don't what? now don't don't any more! what do you

     <p>Don't ask me!</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Oh, but I must? what brings you here?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>Don't ask me, and I'll tell you.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>Well, then, be quick about it. What brings   you here, and in such a plight? you're in some
      scrape, I'm sure! what is it? Tell me; p'raps I may be able to help you. Is it anything about
      money?</p>

     <p>Now Charles, don't frighten me!</p>

     <p>It's too much to hope they'll bring it in justifiable homicide.</p>

     <p>You quite alarm me! do tell me all!</p>

     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>I will! and you will then understand why I am here, in such a state, and why my presence
      must be kept secret from everybody; but most of all, your husband.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>You terrify me!</p>

     <p>Yes, Charles!</p>

     <p>La! <stage>(unlocks buffet, and gives him some)</stage></p>

     <p>Not till you have told your story.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>  Well then, here goes! On Wednesday morning I breakfasted with an old pal of mine of the
      name of Pluxie—we were at Harrow together, and after breakfast we went down the river for a
      quiet row.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>A quiet <hi>row</hi>, I think you mean.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>Don't pun, Polly—it's ungentlemanly! let me see, where was I?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>You were saying—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, thank you, I remember! You can recollect that, from a boy, what an enthusiastic admirer
      I always was of the manly and noble art of self-defence.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>You mean fighting with fists!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>Just so! combined with fencing, single stick, rifle and pistol practice, broadsword,
      wrestling, Cornish, Cumberland and Lancashire, la Savatte, and other gymnastics?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>Well, but what has all that to do—</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>You were saying—</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>If you'd only give me that other drop of liqueur I should be able to get on like a greased

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>  You were saying—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>I remember—thank you. I was saying that Pluxie was a first rate little fellow—not more than
      five feet four in height, but the spirit of a lion, and—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>No, no, Charles—tell me about yourself— you said you went out rowing.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, ay—so I did. Well, Pluxie and I rowed about for some time, till I got to feel very
      thirsty —you know I've a singular pre-disposition that way— so we pulled to shore and went
      into a pub—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>A what?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>A public—a public house, you know, by the river side, just above Chesterton, about four
      miles from Cambridge. Well, we had some swizzle, and a pipe, and proposed returning—we went
      down to the boat, and saw it in the middle of the river with a bargee in it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>A what?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>A bargee—a bargeman, lighterman—a boatman amusing himself with our boat, to the intense
      gratification of some other blackguards, his friends, on the other side the bank. “Hallo!”
      says Pluxie. “How dare you take that liberty?” Bargee kept on, never minding us. “Come out of
      that boat this instant!” shouted Pluxie, waxing wrath. Bargee looked at him and said “I'll see
      you—” But I won't shock your feelings,   Polly, by repeating what he said. No! his language is
      easier imagined than described. The way in which that bargee swore was worthy of the American
      House of Congress. He was as abusive as a patriot, and ten times dirtier. “You come ashore,”
      sings out Pluxie, who stands five feet four, “and I'll give you a good licking.” Well, at that
      the bargee laughs and all his friends—the other blackguards laugh, too. This, of course, rose
      Pluxie's dander to boiling point, and at last the bargee pulled to land to fight. Bargee stood
      six feet two, and was broad out of proportion. We adjourned to a meadow. One of bargee's
      friends did the amiable for him—Pluxie was waited on by yours truly. <stage>(warming with the
      description)</stage> The men peeled—It was a grand sight to see little
      <pb n="10"/> Pluxie square up to the giant as cool and collected as a Don during examination.
      Talk of chivalry—but never mind that, I'll come to the point, Polly, directly—don't be afraid,
      Pluxie was in fine condition, but bargee had too much flesh. After some chaff and a little
      feinting, bargee opened the ball with his left, broke through Pluxie's guard, and Pluxie went
      grasswards—four to one on bargee —but perhaps you never read <hi>Bell's Life</hi>?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>No—what is it? A romance?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>No, a newspaper, full of fancy, and often dealing in fiction—a modern Homer's Iliad,
      published in   weekly parts, price sixpence—however, as you've not been coached up to be
      Romany of the King, I'll translate. Pluxie was soon licked—out of time—nowhere—what could a
      little fellow do against a giant? Now I never could see a row without wanting to be in it
      myself. I had been second—I now offered my services as principal —bargee accepted. We had some
      grog together—shook hands, and toed the scratch.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>You fought the bargeman?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>I did. In the thirteenth round I hit bargee full butt where he puts his beer, and he
      fell—time was called—but bargee couldn't come to time. I was declared victor. I borrowed a
      sov. from Pluxie to give to bargee —he was speechless—we poured grog down his throat
      —useless—<stage>(seizing her hand excitedly)</stage> Polly, bargee was dead!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>Good Heavens! And you—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>I killed him! In the eye of the law I was —I <hi>am</hi> a murderer! Conceive my feelings!
      Bargee's friends behaved like trumps. They said it was in fair fight—but the question was what
      was to be done? It was agreed that I should bolt—Pluxie was to return to college to evade
      suspicion, and I was to make across country to the coast. I had presence of mind enough to
      give Pluxie this address, and he will write to me under   cover to you. Bargee's friends
      picked him up and promised, though they should be compelled to tell the truth to the
      authorities, to give me all the start they could. I ran as fast as I could eastward, thinking
      that your house was not out of my route—and here I am!</p>
    </sp>
    <pb n="11"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>My dear, dear brother! How shocking!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>If you only knew what I felt! I keep up my spirits by chattering, but—there—we won't talk
      about it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>But it's not much more than twenty miles—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>I had to double and double for the fear of the rural police. Imagine my being afraid of a
      policeman! As to the rail, that was quite out of the question. I walked across at
      night—sleeping in the daytime—the first day in a dry ditch—the second, by way of a change, in
      a damp dyke. I daren't go near a house to ask or purchase anything to eat. I got here last
      night, or rather this morning about two o'clock—recognised the house by your
      description—climbed over the garden—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>And how did you manage to get into the house?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>I broke into it. After murder, burglary's a trifle. I found I could open a shutter by the
      aid of a penknife, <hi>àla</hi> Jack Sheppard. I wandered about till somehow—how I don't
      know—I got into this room.   The day broke, but I hadn't broke my fast for two days. I heard
      somebody coming, and crept under the table. When your girl laid breakfast—I couldn't resist
      the temptation, and when her back was turned I collared what I could. Eggs which I eat, shell
      and all, without salt, I thought them delicious—but mind I prefer eggs generally, minus the
      shells, and plus the salt.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>But what am I to do with you?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>Hide me for a few days till I can get to Yarmouth, and so to France, Holland, anywhere! Let
      me see, there is a treaty about criminal extradition, isn't there?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>But my husband is a J. P.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>What's that—Fellow of the Royal Society?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>No, stupid—a Justice of the Peace, and a very active country magistrate.</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>And he has a perfect horror of all fighting with fists. He signalised himself very lately in
      preventing a prize fight between the Patagonian Piccaninny and the Rough 'un's Tough 'un, and
      got the thanks of the Lord Lieutenant.</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>I don't know what to do with you, I'm sure. My husband musn't see you. He'd give you up to
      the   police directly, and you can't remain in those filthy clothes.</p>

     <p>I'll go and lay out some things of my husband's for you. You must leave the house, and go
      down to a little roadside inn, rather more than a mile off, that way—“The Snipe and

      Cambridge, am publicly denounced as a murderer— arraigned in court, called prisoner at the
      bar, and have all the newspapers falling foul of me? The <hi>Illustrated News</hi> will send
      down their special artist to do my head—the <hi>Morning Post</hi> will lament my fate, and the
      want of constitutional stamina of my victim. The organs of the people will denounce me in
      alliterative adjectives, twenty-two syllables long, as a bloated oligarch, and swear that the
      Cambridge men are always killing bargees—it's their regular employment. The <hi>Saturday
      Review</hi>, hearing I come from Cambridge, and not Oxford, will discover that in my youth I
      once hit a little boy ten months my junior, and so, evidenced at an early age, symptoms of the
      sanguinary   disposition that my manhood has borne the fruits of. I could bear all but one
      thing. The reports will describe me as “An interesting young man, evidently suffering from the
      effects of my long confinement,” and the judge will say he is sorry to see a person of my
      station in such a position. There will be a cast taken of my skull, and I shall figure in the
      “Chamber of Horrors” at Madame Tussaud's. Oh, Comte de Lorge—oh, Marat in the bath! I shall

      he, “Go it while you're young,” or words to that effect—my hearing being bad, I cannot swear
      to. “Mind,” he says, says he, “this is for you yourself, and not to count what Squire Boodle

     <p>Near Cambridge. A bargeman was found in a field by some other bargemen, dead. His death is
      supposed to have been caused by the effects of a violent blow, received, perhaps, in a fight.
      The coroner's jury have returned a verdict of “Wilful murder against some person or persons
      unknown.”</p>
