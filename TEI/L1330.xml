    <sp who="#L1330_F7">
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Who would be housemaid in an academy! 'Tis work, work, work, from morning till night. Here
      it's getting on for twelve o'clock, and the front parlour ain't done yet. All in dish-a-billy,
      as missis says, when she hasn't fixed her curls on. And, what's worse, there ain't no
      perquisites now, as there used to was, before missis found a billy-doo in a apple I was
      a-carrying to one of the young ladies. My! wasn't there a row! I nearly lost my place that
      time, I did. Since then she's stopped up the windows, and had those 'ere blinds put up. But,
      law ! they manage to deceive her, for all that. I believe a school-girl would deceive the old
      gentleman hisself! And they calls them hinnocent! I know what their hinnocence is like,
       <stage>(dusting chairs)</stage> Did any one ever see such chairs in all their born lives ?
      Pins and needles! I shall never forget when little Miss Brown first came here. She wore short
      frocks then— <hi>very</hi> short, and when she was put on one of these, didn't she set up a
      howl—that's all ! Not all the jams in missus's cupboard could stop her either. She never sat
      on one again—she didn't. But where is Fido ? Why can't he come and help me ? He gets lazier
      and lazier every day. His infections seem to be froze up, like the pump. Oh ! here he is at
      last.</p>
     <stage> Enter Fido, lazily polishing a shoe, R. c. ; fat to excess. </stage>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1330_F7">
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>So, you've come, have you ? I hope you haven't hurried yourself.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1330_M3">
     <speaker>Fido</speaker>
     <p>Hurried myself? No; I should rather think not. When a young man has reached my proportions,
      it ain't no <pb n="4"/> good hurrying himself. The very thought of hurry makes me ill.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1330_F7">
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>La! Fido. Why?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1330_M3">
     <speaker>Fido</speaker>
     <p>Why ? Ha! Dolly; I've a silent sorrow here. <stage>(knocks the blacking-brush on his
       chest)</stage> Underneath this pink and white exterior I've got such an amount of
      haccumulated hagony, that my only wonder is, it doesn't blow off all my buttons, and reveal
      itself to the eyes of the astonished Clapperclaw.</p>

     <speaker>Fido</speaker>
     <p>Dorothea, I've let concealment, like a worm in the tub, prey on my damask cheek. I'm wearing

     <p>Some day, Dolly, you'll find these 'ere invisible greens empty, and nothing left of me but a

     <speaker>Fido</speaker>
     <p>Love levels all distinctions. If her parents refuse their consent, I'll bear her away to
      some distant climb, and we'll build a harbour by some green wood, on the bank of some
      philandering stream, and pass our days on love and watercresses. Dost like the picture ?

     <p>Ha, ha, ha ! He's a character ! Ha, ha, ha ! But, now I'm alone, let me look round, and
      re-consider my plans. So far, my adventure has succeeded, and my first step is gained. I have
      come to a house I do not know; knocked at its door, and been admitted; have asked for Miss
      Smith (as I thought, there <hi>is</hi> a Miss Smith ; there <hi>always</hi> is a Miss Smith in
      a school), and here I am. But why am I here? Why have I—I, Sir Charles Chatterton, of
      Chatterton Manor, come to a house I do not know, and knocked at a door I never knocked at
      before, and asked for a girl I've never seen, and only know she is <hi>Miss Smith !</hi> This
      confounded snow is the cause. Who ever knew snow at this time of the year!— such snow, too!
      Spoilt our fun; might as well be in Town sgain. Wish I were ! Hunting, impossible; skating,
      bosh; snowballing, caddish; duck-shooting, trash; sleigh-driving, pooh ! Tired of billiards,
      disgusted with myself, everybody, and everything; but ready for any fresh sport to kill time.
      So, hit upon a wager with the fellows, that one of us should come to this school, ask to see a
      girl we'd never seen, and cut off a lock of her hair, with her own permission and the
      governess's. We tossed : it fell to me. They bet two to one I shouldn't do it. I took it in
      ponies, and here I am. It will be hard if I can't induce a merry school-girl to lend herself
      to a bit of fun ! I wonder if she's a trot in pinafores, or a venerable spinster in
      spectacles!</p>
