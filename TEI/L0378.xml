<head>SCENE I. </head>
<stage>—Gun platform of the parade of Elizabeth Castle; time, early in the
morning. Sentinels are pacing up and down; the moon shines brightly. The left
hand of perspective shows the Island of Jersey and Tower of St. Helier's, the
clock of which is heard to strike three.</stage>

<p>The lieutenant, with all his oddities, deserves to be respected by military
men: he has seen much service, and is brave to a fault.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M7">
<speaker>Flowers.</speaker>
<p>I wish he was a coward to a fault, he'd run away from mine, perhaps. But what
an old gig it is!—with a face like a leg of pork after an hour's roasting, a
head as frosty as Mount St. Bernard, and a tail like a roasting pig!—he can't
speak without giving the word of command, and his “Attention” may be heard all
over the castle. I tell you, Serjeant Brill, that old daddy Bland is—</p>

<p>Ready, lads; salute the old gentleman as the commanding officer wishes.</p>
<stage>Enter Lieutenant Bland, R. 1 E., dressed in military uniform; the blue
coat almost green, the lace and epaulettes very much tarnished; boots and
breeches as the Corporal describes; his accoutrements in very good order; he
wears a pigtail, and his whole appearance that of a comic Frederick the
Great.</stage>

<p>Last night, your honour. I am going to—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>Keep awake, of course: no good soldier goes to bed above once a week. In
fact, I don't know that a soldier has any business to sleep at all; and if he
does, it should be like   geese, on one leg, with his chin on the muzzle of his
musket.</p>

</sp>
<stage>Enter Captain Gay, in the uniform of the Rifle Corps—green, with black
braidings; appointments, black and silver. Lieutenant Edgecombe, uniform of the
Fifty-eighth, L. U. E.</stage>

<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p> Come along, Charles; the major's party have not seen us yet. All's right,
and now I defy the devil and— <stage>(sees Bland)</stage> —old daddy Bland, by
all that's terrible!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M2">
<speaker>Edge.</speaker>
<p> Why name the devil and our worthy artillery senior in the same breath, eh?
<stage>(sees Bland.)</stage> The devil! Good morning, Mr. Bland, I hope I see
you well— </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p> Or at the devil, eh? Yes, gentlemen, old daddy Bland is here; and now I ask,
with all due respect to the Fifty-eighth and Rifle Corps, what the devil you do
here, gentlemen?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>Why, sir, my friend Charles and myself, we have been at our military studies
all night—storming forts—taking them —attacking in column—taking possession of
the breastworks— forcing a breach—plundering the town—and retreating with our
brows bound with laurel.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>What! retreating, and our brows bound with laurel! Why who the devil heard of
laurels gained in a retreat?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>All who have the honour of calling themselves the countrymen of Sir John
Moore.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>Eh? Oh, yes—oh, yes; Sir John Moore, yes. Stop, let me take off my hat.
<stage>(all take off their hats.)</stage> Sir John Moore! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>All right, Charles.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>Let me tell you, gentlemen, that Sir John Moore didn't go gallanting of a
night, in despite of garrison orders, as you do. So don't think I'm to be
palavered over. No, no; I never, gentlemen, was guilty of a breach of discipline
in my life, and I am now seventy-five.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>What, Mr. Bland?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M2">
<speaker>Edge.</speaker>
<p>
<stage> (with affected surprise.)</stage> What, seventy-five? </p>
<pb n="6"/>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>Why, Charles, what did you suppose the lieutenant's age?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M2">
<speaker>Edge.</speaker>
<p>   Fifty-three I should have sworn in any company in Europe.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>Really! Why you are certainly nearer to the truth than me. I put Mr. Bland
down at six-and-forty, and, in fact, told Lady Mary Meriville so last week; and
she said she had no idea, from his appearance, that he had been anything near so
old.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>Did she though, eh? Ha, ha, ha! Well, I don't know. I was born in the
Artillery Corps, and regimental books are frequently lost, and I never was
registered otherwise; but I—I—might not be so old.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M2">
<speaker>Edge.</speaker>
<p>You can't, my dear sir; it don't stand to reason!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>Let anybody look at Mr. Bland this morning!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>Why, yes, boys, I think this is one of my good-looking days. Go on,
gentlemen, go on.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>Come, Charles; the lieutenant says we are to go on. Come to our rooms.
<stage>(crosses, R. H.)</stage></p>

</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>
<stage> (stopping them.)</stage> No, no, gentlemen; if you please, you will give
an account of your unsoldierlike conduct. How will you like to see yourselves
superseded, gentlemen, eh?— perhaps broke, eh?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M2">
<speaker>Edge.</speaker>
<p>My dear sir, I—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>Really, upon my word, Charles, you are unpardonable. Had you brought the book
with you, it would have cleared us in Mr. Bland's opinion, which, I may truly
say, I value more   than any man's in the service.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>What book, eh? what book?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M2">
<speaker>Edge.</speaker>
<p>What the devil is he at now? <stage>(aside.)</stage>
</p>

</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>Why, a book I had been anxiously waiting for during the whole night—a history
of the taking of Montreal, wherein the names of Lieutenant Bland and the
Engineers are made such honourable mention of—Charles and I pored over it with
delight—with enthusiasm—the just tribute of a grateful country to a venerated
friend so gallant and true. <stage>(they bow to Bland.)</stage></p>

</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p> Gentlemen— <stage>(bows.)</stage> —I certainly endeavoured to do my duty. I
was quite a youngster then, and I—he, he, he!— I didn't know that it had been
taken such notice of. Will you favour me with the book for a few moments? </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M2">
<speaker>Edge.</speaker>
<p>
<stage> (aside.)</stage> How the devil will he get out of it now?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>Why, Mr. Bland, I gave it to the lieutenant here to bring. He forgot it, and
I was bewailing my disappointment when we had the honour of meeting you.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p> Well, well; but don't stay out again. Go to your <pb n="7"/> rooms—
<stage>(crossing, R.)</stage> —but, eh, stop; your stomachs are raw this
morning. In my room, in the left cupboard, you'll find some cherry brandy.
Lieutenant Edgecombe, by the commandant's order, I appoint you to the Grand
Round to-night. Away, gentlemen. Bastion Twenty-four, fire the morning salute
gun. <stage>(goes round, giving orders; gun fires without.)</stage>

<p>Zounds! how could you be so imprudent!</p>

<speaker>Madame.</speaker>
<p>Well, now, really, as I am a gentlewoman and mother of a good girl, I must
put an end to the visits of that young English officer. I begin to repent that I
ever allowed him a footing here. My nephew will be home from England soon, and
I'll ask his advice upon the subject; but for this Lieutenant Edgecombe—</p>

<speaker>Marie.</speaker>
<p>My dear mother, what about Lieutenant Edgecombe? Has he sent any letter here
this morning, or sent to inquire after my health by the orderly?</p>

<p>Really, Marie, you ought to be more orderly. Lieutenant Edgecombe is a good

<speaker>Madame.</speaker>
<p>I'll tell you, child: you may fall in love with him, and he with you. Never
fall in love with a nice young man; it's ruin, either one way or the other. Your
nice young fellows give themselves such airs after marriage, forsooth; they soon
let a wife find she is a wife. You marry as ugly a man as you can meet with!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_F11">
<speaker>Marie.</speaker>
<p> I am much obliged to you, but I'd much rather not; and I believe that most

and the flashing eye of genius to the arched forehead and studied curl of
affectation.</p>

<speaker>Madame.</speaker>
<p>Your uncle was a sort of elegant Æsop—a large head, small body, little legs,
and giant's feet; he'd lost one eye, and squinted with the other. He was a duck
of a man. You don't meet every day with such a being.</p>

<p>No; the sweet pattern of conjugal fidelity we were. He never said a word or a
civil thing to any woman during the whole of his connubial existence. But our

<p>Yes, yes; I've heard the tale reported—a story something like the Arabian

doubtless a few deserters from the foreign mercenaries.</p>

<p>Yes, when the people bought it; otherwise rather   dull; a little bothered
for matter, we were on Friday—old Hardfeature, the smith, had been to see his
friends in Essex for a week—charming opportunity, I wrote a flaming account of
his murder—public curiosity was excited—the “Halfpenny Humbug” sold
beautifully—unfortunately, the murdered man came back alive—the “Humbug” was
found out—the smith didn't like to lose his livelihood.</p>

London you know; at the last moment, Tom pressed my hand and said, “Bill
Stickers, take care of yourself;” and bless your soul, when I got up to London
there was “Bill Stickers beware,” put up at the corner of every street; “No Bill

<p>This is a very shocking affair, but I can't believe it. I sent Edgecombe to
La Roque Tower this morning, deputing Lacy, in his room, at the castle.
Ma'mselle Marie must have been mistaken. I've sent off a dozen dragoons in
several directions. Blood near the spot, but no visible marks of a struggle! It
can't be. A man never went out of the world without a struggle.</p>

lead up to the aperture; part of which is discernible to the Audience. On L. H.
a low grated door, apparently belonging to a dungeon; at the back is seen
several entrances to interior caverns; along the upper part, and over the
entrance to the back caves is a rude gallery in the rock—a very huge
oak-fashioned table in centre of stage, with benches, horns and implements about
here and there—a gun, &amp;c.</stage>

the Fifty-eighth; of muskets we have plenty. Let a dozen men attire themselves
