   <head>THE LAST OF THE LEGENDS; Or THE BARON, THE BRIDE, AND THE BATTERY.</head>
   <div type="scene">
    <stage type="setting"> Scene First - The Ruins of an ancient Castle overlooking the Rhine;
     ivy-grown battlements, L. c., culminating ascent from beneath; at back smiling landscape,
     through which the river is seen winding away ; as the curtain rises the following invisible
     Chorus is heard.</stage>
    <lg>
     <head>Invisible Chorus.</head>
     <l>Older than all history,</l>
     <l>Come from an age long, long ago!</l>
     <l>We live lost in mystery,</l>
     <l>And now,—we find it rather slow!</l>
    </lg>
    <stage>The old clock of the Castle strikes seven; on the seventh stroke, portions of the ruins
     glide away, and discover in a tableau, Karl, Fritz,Seltzerwasser, Erlinda, Wilhelm, and Others.
     They all rise and come down, looking about them with considerable surprise.</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Karl.</speaker>
     <p>Dear me! where am I? Have I been dreaming— or dining—or what ? <stage>(looks about
      him)</stage> Yes;—yet no! Is this Pilfersberg? described in the advertisement that caught my
      respected father's eye, it seems but yesterday, as "An eligible castellated country villa
      residence, in thorough and substantial repair !”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>“ Containing forty-seven bed rooms, the usual offices, a machine for pouring boiling lead
      upon the heads of a besieging force, and every other modern comfort and convenience. Fixtures,
      including a family ghost, to be taken at a valuation.”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Karl.</speaker>
     <p>Exactly, Seltzerwasser! But where <stage>(looking about)</stage>, where—where's the elegant
      new zinc roof I had put on the top of that tower ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>The second-hand porcullis your papa picked up a
      <pb n="4"/> bargain at Damascus ? and, I say, what—what has become of his summer torture
      chamber, all beautifully got up, and newly furnished ? <stage>(looking at a portion of
      ruin)</stage> Why, I do believe this is where it stood ! Yes, here’s the door!—ruins, every
      stone of it. I don’t think the bill for the instruments is paid yet.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Erlin.</speaker>
     <p>Why, it all looks as if a thousand years had passed over it!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>It does, my dear; but it is to be hoped they haven’t been sending in their account every
      quarter, or they must have ruined the firm in invoices some five hundred years ago.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Karl.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(to Erlinda)</stage> You said a thousand years ! Why, now I come to think of it,
      we’ve only got this place for nine hundred and ninety-nine—the usual term!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>Then you may depend upon it, it’s run out a twelvemonth. It all comes of your papa’s
      economy, wanting to save something on the stamp! Just like him.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fritz.</speaker>
     <p>But who could tell he would want a renewal?. I have never come across anything a thousand
      years old yet.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>Then you’ve never heard one of my jokes, that’s certain ! Will you have one ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Karl.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(stopping him)</stage> No, no! I feel quite depressed enough as it is! A thousand
      years, then horror! What will have become of the lady of Abbeville—my chosen love ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>Most probably a leading feature in the sarcophagus department of the British Museum. Send
      for a catalogue.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Karl.</speaker>
     <p>Not so; but quick, saddle my black charger, and let me off to her sea-girt castle at
      once.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, that’s the secret of your annual expedition to Boulogne. I told your weak-minded father
      there was more than donkey-rides and sea-bathing at the back of your indifferent French.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Karl.</speaker>
     <p>You were right. There was—listen!</p>

     <stage>Karl— Song— "The Cottage by the Sea."</stage>

     <p>Yes, I will away at once!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>Before you’ve solved this riddle— </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Karl.</speaker>
     <p>Riddle! What riddle ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>Well, I should call it a tidy one. Isn’t it rather confounding to find oneself, one’s
      clothes, retainers, appetite, rheumatism, and all in the midst of a property that looks—
      <stage>(looking round)</stage> as if it had been let unfurnished to a hyaena on a long term.
      But there, I know what’s happened!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Karl.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(rushing to him)</stage> You do! Speak.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Erlin.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(same business)</stage> Oh, tell us, do !</p>
    </sp>
    <pb n="5"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fritz.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(same business)</stage> Quick, Seltzer, out with it!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>It’s as clear as the sky in the roof of your dining room. We’re in a <hi>legend!</hi></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>All.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(start)</stage> A legend! <stage>(Music)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, in a <hi>legend!</hi> We’re <hi>part</hi> of a legend. I might say, humbugged into a
      legend. I feel convinced when I regard my boots, and think how much I should relish a ham
      sandwich, that I have been to sleep for a thousand years.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>All.</speaker>
     <p>A thousand years!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(to Karl)</stage> Yes; don’t you remember the strange Saxon Knight, who asked your
      sister Bertha’s hand ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Erlin.</speaker>
     <p>Yes; and how you promised it to him, as he started for the wars! You know you did !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fritz.</speaker>
     <p>And swore an oath that you would wait <hi>ten centuries </hi>for his return! <stage>(all
      start)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>And that very night—finding that he had but two hundred a year, a mere trifle in
      ready-money, and no expectations worth mentioning—had him, at the advice of his rival, Sir
      Hubert de Bow — </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Erlin.</speaker>
     <p>And spite the prayers of my dear Lady Bertha — </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(mysteriously)</stage> Put into the haunted chamber— <stage>(horror of all)</stage>
      from which he evidently never returned! At seven the next morning I took him his shaving
      water, his helmet, and his boots!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fritz.</speaker>
     <p>And found the three-foot-six flock mattress — </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>Empty! <stage>(horror of all)</stage> Your injudicious oath has taken effect! Ten centuries
      <hi>have</hi> elapsed since I put the finishing polish to those boots! But, hush! here comes
      the Lady Bertha; and with her her false admirer! Silence—not a word of this to her!</p>
    </sp>

    <stage>Enter Lady Bertha,followed by Sir Hubert—she carries a roll of paper, and he holds an
     empty stout bottle—all bow to her respectfully.</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
     <p>Count Fritz, you remember that song you made about that happy night when we wandered
      together by the seashore? I am melancholy—cheer me—I would hear the dulcet strains once
      more!</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Song—Fritz—"Sparkling Eyes."</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Sir H.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, fair lady, forget the foreign swain, the rosy dawn, and think of me, who for the hundred
      and nineteenth time offers you his heart, his hand, and his balance at his banker’s,
      <stage>(offering her the stout bottle)</stage> One smile, one look, fair Bertha, and this
      priceless <hi>objet d'art</hi> exquisite in design,
      <pb n="6"/>and matchless in its workmanship, shall be thine,<stage> (he holds it
      out)</stage></p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Bertha.</speaker>
     <p>It is indeed beautiful; but, Sir Hubert, you know I am affianced to another. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Karl.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(looking at "bottle)</stage> Must be true Venetian! What ; grace! What colour! Where,
      gallant sir knight, where did you obtain that? </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Sir H.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(with a swagger)</stage> I found it in the palace of Saladin : himself, defended by
      seventy Turks, through whom I cleft my path, to gain the prize and place it at your lovely
      sister’s feet, <stage>(aside)</stage> Just picked it up in the ditch outside my window, half
      concealed by the <hi>debris</hi> of a lobster salad. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fritz.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(admiringly)</stage> Most delicate! And see, there is some inscription on its side.
      Oh, it’s a gem!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(reading)</stage> “ Double London Stout.”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Karl.</speaker>
     <p>Double London Stout ! What does that mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Erlin.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(rapturously)</stage> Perhaps the true elixir of life !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(taking bottle)</stage> I shouldn’t wonder. It tastes uncommon like it. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Bertha.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(unfolding a large poster on which is written legibly “Daily Telegraph, largest
      circulation in the world. Price one penny.”)</stage> And what does <hi>this</hi> mean? I found
      it ; affixed to my bedchamber wall in the castle.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Wilhelm.</speaker>
     <p>Some fearless knight—and that <stage>(points to poster)</stage>must be his
      <hi>standard.</hi></p>
    </sp>


    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>Standard! No, that’s his «Telegraph!”<stage>(reads)</stage> " Largest circulation in the
      world!” Oh, I give it up; he must be " on the confines of the boundless desert,” or at some
      fearful spot beyond the reach of human “correspondence.” But wait! This will decide. If I
      have topped Methuselah and the fair lady Bertha is a charming creature of a thousand and
      nineteen summers, possibly we shall find some trifling change below, <stage> (points to
      scene)</stage> My youthful but patriarchal master, hear your doom. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Karl.</speaker>
     <p>At once! <stage>(approaches battlements and suddenly starts)</stage> Ha! what do I see? A
      mighty city on the site of my wild boar forest!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fritz.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(looking)</stage> And the castle of the terrible Baron of Hapenstein, neatly laid out
      in gravel paths and garden seats, and - </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>Labelled with a notice that "The band plays from four to six,” and is entirely supported by
      “voluntary contributions.” </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(looking)</stage> Oh, how exquisite! Look, Erlinda, look, at yonder chamber window a
      maiden is seated at her afternoon toilette! How lovely her complexion !</p>
    </sp>
    <pb n="7"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Erlin.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(same business)</stage> And what a lot of it she has got in that paper!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(in admiration)</stage> How slowly she puts on her jewels—one by one!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fritz.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(same business)</stage> And how quickly she puts on her back hair—all at once!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
     <p>So she does ! Wonderful ! But look in the high road beneath. A beautiful bright yellow
      vehicle drawn by two horses, and licensed to carry sixteen inside and thirteen out. Oh, it is
      exquisite! What luxury! </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>And the magnificent word "Omnibus" painted in large blue letters on its side !<stage>(wonder
      of all)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Otto.</speaker>
     <p>And what a noble driver on the box.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Sir B.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(looking over)</stage> And everybody walking about without a battle axe, and passing
      each other—positively, without cutting each other’s throats ! Call that chivalry ! Gammon!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Karl.</speaker>
     <p>But look, a huge craft rounds the point on wheels !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>Upon which «No smoking is allowed abaft the funnel.”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
     <p>See, it nears the shore !They land, oh, horrible !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fritz.</speaker>
     <p>They are set upon by varlets who rob them of their goods!</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>(to &gt;Karl)</stage> Quite reminds one of your father !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Sir H.</speaker>
     <p>Let us on to the attack.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>Quite unnecessary, the struggle is over, and they are taken captive by the proprietors of
      the several neighbouring hotels !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Sir H.</speaker>
     <p>But one has escaped! Ha, and advances to the foot of the ascent! He is coming up,
      and—yes—seems quite unarmed! <stage>(drawing a sword)</stage> By Sir Bugo of Bow Street, but
      I’ll make short work of him !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Bertha.</speaker>

     <p>You will not touch him. <stage>(to Karl)</stage> Brother, you will protect the defenceless
      stranger. Perhaps he is a Saxon knight disguised. Spare him !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Erlin.</speaker>
     <p>He may tell us where that maiden got that lovely hair. Spare him !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>He may have straying through his memory an unmade joke. By all means spare him!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Karl.</speaker>
     <p>He may bring me some message from the lovely Lady Rose. Her people talked of going over with
      the Conqueror for change of air. They may have met at Hastings! <stage>(aloud)</stage> He
      shall be spared! <stage>(looks)</stage> Quick, he is on his way to the summit now—so hide, all
      of you; and if be has no manners, think of his tender age. He comes !</p>

    <stage>All gradually retire.</stage>

    <stage>Enter Smith—he has on a modem tourist suit, carries a small opera glass, camp stool, and
     knapsack, as he enters he has a "Murray's Handbook" open in his hand—he seats himself in
     centre.</stage>

     <speaker>Smith.</speaker>
     <p>Let’s see—ah! here we are! <stage>(reads)</stage> "Pilfersberg—a well preserved ruin; date

     <p>The Normans? Why they’ve <hi>been.</hi> Oh yes, they got on all right enough; but that’s a

     <p>No, that's the only one I've ever heard of; there was one made forty-two years ago, but

     <p>With pleasure. My young but eccentric master, the Baron—appreciating the scientific
      advantages of the twenty-second century, but not exactly seeing its clothes, has entrusted
      this trifle to me, with directions that I am perpetually to keep the lot, and you, under the
      impression you are existing where, but for his unlucky oath, you would have existed together,
      in due course, with your administrators, executors, and assigns; in fact where you did.<stage>

     <p>All fancy—I can assure you it’s all fancy! All in ruins —all in ruins! But, as long as
      you’re happy, what does it signify? Why, I’ve put our youthful liege into a state himself
      several times this morning—it has comforted him to imagine he is waiting, a thousand years
      ago, at the Etablissement at Boulogne, and paying compliments to his boyish love, the Lady
      Rose. See, here he comes. He’s at it still ! Humour him!</p>

     <p>What—and shall I never—never again see the lovely Rose?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>She'll be two thousand and seventeen instead of one, that's all. But what's a century or two
      at her time of life ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Karl.</speaker>
     <p>Silence, fool! I tell you she lives—she breathes—and I will see her yet. Rose, thou fairest,
      sweetest of flowers, I'll sing thy beauty!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>What, when you have only five-and-twenty minutes to live ? </p>
    </sp>

     <p>Silence, and listen!</p>

     <speaker>Karl.</speaker>
     <p>But, tell me, will not this stranger ratify my inconsiderate oath, and wed the heiress of
      Pilfersberg ? I bade you make him—ha!—the talisman! You have lost it!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>I'm very sorry. I was giving him an extra dose of it—bringing him to the point—when—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>All.</speaker>
     <p>Well? </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>

     <p>It went over the battlements into the depths of the cold river beneath. <stage>(All express

    <sp>
     <speaker>Karl.</speaker>
     <p>And the stranger ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>Can't even stand a fiver to stop it. I sent him into the twelfth century—you told me to do
      it—and there I left him. He’s in for it, too!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Karl.</speaker>
     <p>But he <hi>shall</hi> wed! You mentioned the boiling oil ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
     <p>I did; and he seemed to prefer it to matrimony. He is turning the matter over now in the

      crumble away.</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Smith.</speaker>
     <p>The offer <hi>is</hi> tempting; but, no; I prefer physical to social annihilation. Let the
      hour strike !</p>
