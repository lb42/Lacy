    <head>BEFORE THE PARTY.</head>
    <stage>Scene.—An elegant Drawing Room, C., with open doors; doors, R. and L.</stage>
    <stage>Mrs. Harcourt discovered seated, reading, L.—Penson arranging furniture.</stage>
    <sp who="#L0993_F6">
     <speaker>Mrs. Harcourt.</speaker>
     <p>That'll do, Penson. If you go on altering and arranging for ever, you will never make the
      rooms larger.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F8">
     <speaker>Penson.</speaker>
     <p>Well, ma'am, as a villa is but a villa, howsomever you arrange it—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F6">
     <speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
     <p>Just so; then don't attempt impossibilities.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F8">
     <speaker>Penson.</speaker>
     <stage> (coming down)</stage>
     <p>No, ma'am. Master's rather late: he's coming home in time for the party, I suppose,
      ma'am.?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F6">
     <speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
     <p>What an absurd question, Penson! Why shouldn't your master come home?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F8">
     <speaker>Penson.</speaker>
     <p>Beg pardon, ma'am; didn't mean any offence, I'm sure. Only master's been out so much lately
      that—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F6">
     <speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
     <p>Penson, you forget yourself. Pray hold your tongue about matters that don't concern you: you
      should keep your place.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F8">
     <speaker>Penson.</speaker>
     <stage> (aside)</stage>
     <p>Yes, I mean to do that, spite of everything.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F6">
     <speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
     <p>Because I am more familiar with you than most mistresses, you should not presume. I
      certainly <emph>do</emph> talk a great deal to you, as I am—so much—so much—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F8">
     <speaker>Penson.</speaker>
     <p>So much <emph>alone</emph>, ma'am.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F6">
     <speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
     <p>Certainly not; I was not going to say that.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F8">
     <speaker>Penson.</speaker>
     <p>I thought you were going to say that master being out so much, you naturally—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F6">
     <speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
     <stage> (rises and comes down, R.)</stage>
     <p>Once for all, Penson, do<emph> not </emph>refer to that again.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F8">
     <speaker>Penson.</speaker>
     <p>Seeing it's a sore point, ma'am, I'll be careful. What's that? I'm sure I hear the sound of
      a silk dress—an expensive silk, too. There's ten and sixpence a yard in every rustle.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F6">
     <speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
     <p>Oh! it's Mrs. Delacour; she said she'd come early.</p>

     <p>Well, my dear, here I am you see, punctual as ever.</p>

     <speaker>Mrs. D.</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Delacour! Now, I declare if you call me by that odious name, I'll go away home this
      minute; you are perfectly well aware I was christened Emily, and why you should be continually
      reminding me of the great misfortune of my life, I can't divine.</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Mrs. D.</speaker>
     <p>Oh! of course; they're always on business. Poor dear Delacour was <emph>always</emph> out,

    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F6">
     <speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
     <p>He died a year after your marriage, did he not?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. D.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, dear; leaving me a widow,—nothing more. Luckily, my property being settled on myself,
      he couldn't touch it. Ah! my dear, Time having softened the resentment I once bore him, I can
      now content myself by saying he was a  sad brute!</p>

     <speaker>Mrs. D.</speaker>
     <p>I can't play the hypocrite, dear. I was forced, a mere child, to marry him, and he tried his
      best to break my heart; but he didn't do it, dear—ha, ha, ha! Oh, dear no! It's wonderful what
      a deal hearts will endure—after marriage. It's rather odd your husband hasn't come in, isn't
      it?</p>

     <p>Charley's been always accustomed to live well, and our cook's not accomplished, and so

     <p>I met him at Harrogate last year—met him a great deal. You know what watering places are.
      Society seems to fling aside its conventional reserve, and people revel for a short season in
      being natural. Folks get quite friendly and familiar until they come back to town with its
      gloom and its dismal propriety.</p>

     <p>Ay, Clarry, call it what you like, it comes to that. When a man has no income and no

      way, next door to what's dishonest. If I snatch a penny bun from a cake shop counter, I'm a
      thief; if I order a grand supper from a confectioner's, and can't pay for it when the bill
      comes in, I'm a victim to pecuniary pressure. It's a longer phrase; but it don't express much

      settle his pecuniary difficulties, and then he can start afresh. It was very sensible of you
      disclosing everything as you did. How much better it would be if people would always speak out
      at once. Now the whole business is explained, there's little enough in it. The fellow's a
