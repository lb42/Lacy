    <head>Act I .</head>
    <head>Scene first .</head>
    <p>—The Sitting Room in Mrs. Eversleigh's Bungalow. A spacious white walled room opening in flat
     to verandah by large folding French windows, furnished with green jalousies ; between the
     wooden pillars of the verandah are rolled-up mats of reeds, the floor is covered with fine
     matting, the chintz-covered couches and lounging chairs are of a light construction, cane or
     bamboo ; drawings here and there on the walls ; entrances to other rooms, R. and L., marked by
     purdahs or curtains of stuff or cotton, disposed in broad stripes of red and white, and kept
     stretched by laths passed across at intervals of about a foot; beyond the verandah a narrow
     strip of garden, bright with its growth of Himalayah rhododendrons, and shaded with clumps of
     deodaras and sycamore; beyond the garden, which is supposed to occupy the plateau on which the
     bungalow stands, are seen the vast ridges and profound valleys of the Himalayahs, and in the
     extreme distance, the great snowy range glittering in the sky ; as the curtain rises, the
     Tailor Men are seen at work in the verandah, sewing and embroidering Eastern muslin and other
     Eastern materials of female wear.</p>
    <p>A Khitmugar, with an Indian whisk made of a yok's tail, is brushing off the dust and flies
     from the furniture ; an Ayah is receiving some finished article of dress from one of the tailor
     men. Mrs. Eversleigh discovered in a lounging chair, R. C. ; Mahlee approaches and offers
     flowers, R.</p>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mahlee .</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(R.)</stage> Mahlee's humble offering! There is but one rose and one burra
      beebee!</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> <stage>(languidly)</stage> Tell Mogloo to put them in water Monee, take away the syringa—it
      overpowers me.</p>
     <stage> Exit Mahlee, R.</stage>
     <stage> Enter Khansumah, R. C., first opening. Exeunt Ayahs and Boy, L. C., also
      Tailor.</stage>

     <speaker>Khan .</speaker>
     <p> <stage><stage>(coming forward salaaming, R.)</stage></stage> Will the Mem Sahib give orders
      for to-day's dinner?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Settle it yourself, Ramdeholl, and don't persecute me.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Khan .</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(producing papers)</stage> Also, there is the account for things bought in the
      bazaar this month.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> What have I to do with it? Ask Major Stonihurst to look it over—You know he always checks
      your account. <stage>(Khansumah salaams and retires, R. C.)</stage> What should I do without
      him? Now that I am left alone in the world—enervated by this dreadful Indian climate—I feel
      his delicate and thoughtful kindness more and more every day. Ah! one of my tame griffs! and
      their dilapidated leader, Captain Slack.</p>
    </sp>
    <stage> Enter Greenway with Slack, L. C.</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> How do, Mrs. Eversleigh? <stage>(feebly)</stage> I tried to keep him away, but he would
      come !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> And Mrs. Eversleigh is glad to see me—don't you see she is. I say, Mrs. Eversleigh—the
      Major says we youngsters bore you; and that we musn't call without orders.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> <stage>(C.)</stage> He is very kind. You <hi>are</hi> rather troublesome at times—you have
      such overpowering spirits, Mr. Greenway.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> Yes; <stage>(seated, R.)</stage> I'm rather a stunner—lucky I am, or I couldn't stand this
      country—Isn't it a deuce of a climate ? Nine months vapour bath, and three months douche
      alternately. Here's old Slack is regularly breaking up.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Captain Slack does look rather exhausted.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(seated R. of table)</stage> If I might trespass on your hospitality, Mrs.
      Eversleigh, for a peg of soda— and brandy.</p>
    </sp>
    <pb n="5"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Ask for whatever you like ! <stage>(she calls)</stage> } Khansumah!</p>
     <stage> Enter Khansumah, R. C.</stage>
     <p>Take the Sahib's commands!
     <stage>(Khansumah takes orders from Slack, apart)</stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> A bottle of B. B. for me ! I'm as seedy as a P. and O. fowl this morning! I was up till
      gun-fire, at blind hookey. Such a wet night, and such a jolly shindy in the bazaar, coming
      home from the Major's Bungalow!</p>
     <stage> Exit Khansumah, R. C.</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> You silly boy!—you ought to blush, instead of boasting!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> Oh, Slack does the blushing, and I do the bounce! It's the division of labour, Mrs.
      Eversleigh; one must divide one's labour in this infernal climate— into the smallest pieces
      too. Look at the niggers !—don't it take three of 'em to black a boot! I believe on parade
      days Slack has four khitmugars to his own cheek, to get him into his uniform.
      <stage>(rises)</stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> Oh! fire away, griff—when you've had as much of Indian service as I have ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> And as much Bass and brandy pawnee, and peg—to say nothing of Mess Blackstrap, Claret, and
      sparkling Moselle—I shall be as ricketty, perhaps, but it will be a long time first. If it
      wasn't for the hills, Slack, you know you'd tumble to pieces every hot weather.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> Is it any wonder, with this climate ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> Climate be hanged! Look at Stonihurst!— He's had eight years of Indian service over
      you—half of 'em up at Lahore too; and he's as fresh as a griff; and as hard as a hill
      pony.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> Ah, Stonihurst! He's a wonder—mind and body! There's a constitution, Mrs. Eversleigh, and
      there's a head ! To see him knock off his company's accounts, before he got his step—it was
      wonderful!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> And such a performer across country! If you could only see him out pig-sticking, Mrs.
      Eversleigh —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> I've no taste for such butchery. <stage>(gets up)</stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> Butchery ! it's beautiful. He handles his spear as gracefully as you do your fan; and then
      to see him
      <pb n="6"/>
      make twenty off the balls without a break—that's something like billiard
      playing.</p>
     <stage>(Khansumah appears in verandah with beer, and brandy, and soda water bottles, on
      tray)</stage> 
     <stage> Exit Greenway, R. C.</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green. </speaker>
     <p>But here's Slack's brandy and soda, and my double Bass. We'll have it in the verandah. I
      say, Mrs. Eversleigh, why am I like Lablache ? Because I'm a Basso profondo—deep in Bass !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> I must see that griff doesn't do himself a mischief. It's astonishing how these boys wash
      their wits away with that pale ale.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Give brandy pawnee its due.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> Yes, that's very bad too; I wouldn't touch a drop if I weren't recommended to take it
      medicinally.</p>
     <stage> Exit Slack, R. C.</stage>
     <stage> Enter Major Stonihurst, L. C., by verandah, followed by Shawl Merchant, who waits
      aside; he exchanges a salute with Slack and Greenway.</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(L.)</stage> Ah, my dear Clara!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> <stage>(R.)</stage> Good morning, Edward ! always apropos. Here are that troublesome
      Khansumah's accounts for you to look over.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Too happy! those fellows would eat you up alive, unprotected female as you are, if you were
      left to fight them single-handed. But you will be out of your mourning soon. I've brought up
      Dherah Singh, the Cashmere shawl merchant.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> <stage>(with great animation)</stage> The shawl merchant ! Oh, delightful! after wearing
      nothing but greys and violets these six months, to revel in colour once more.</p>
     <stage>(while she speaks, Shawl Merchants have opened their bales, and surrounded Mrs.
      Eversleigh with the contents, displaying them on the furniture, &amp;c. </stage>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Oh ! what a lovely turquoise ! and what gorgeous green and gold! and this crimson ! I'm
      completely puzzled—an <hi>embarras de richesses.</hi> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> You must take all three. The turquoise when you mean to melt, the green when you intend to
      awaken hope, and the crimson when you are resolved to subdue.</p>
    </sp>
    <pb n="7"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> But I shall be ruined.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p><stage>( to Mrs. Eversleigh)</stage> Leave me to settle with the fellow. You are no match
      for these rascals. <stage>(to the Shawl Merchants)</stage> Clear out ! <stage>(they salaam and
      withdraw to verandah, L. C.)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> You are always so kind to me.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> What else do I live for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> <stage>(to Monee)</stage> Take away the shawls, Monee.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Stop ! I must make your pretty little Monee a present. Choose something from his stock,
      Monee.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Monee .</speaker>
     <p> Let the Sahib choose for me.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Here! this orange scarf.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Monee .</speaker>
     <p> Thanks, Sahib! <stage>(she takes the scarf, and presses it passionately to her lips unseen
      by Mrs. Eversleigh)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(to Mrs. Eversleigh)</stage> You have your card for the bachelor's ball ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Yes ; but I don't think I shall go—I'm scarcely out of my mourning yet.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> That might be a reason at home; but we are not so straitlaced in India, you know. Do
      come—or I shall have to stay away; and as I am Chairman of the Committee —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Well, if you'll decide upon my dress —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> I've been contriving one as I came along. I'll manage the details with old Madho yonder
      before I go.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> I often wonder how it is you always choose so much better for me than I can for myself!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Because I consult the picture in my heart— you, the reflection in your looking-glass!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> What should I do without you to protect me at all points ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> When will you allow me to protect you by a more authoritative title than that of friend—as
      your husband ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Hush ! it's still too soon for that—</p>
     <stage> Enter Khansumah with, letters, R. C.</stage>
     <p>The post dauk ! these letters are such a nuisance !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p> Pray don't mind me. <stage>(seated, L.)</stage></p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> What, the Colonel of Our's ? I didn't know you were acquaintances.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> She writes to say she's coming to stay with me during her husband's absence on service.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Mrs. Colonel Mac is not exactly the inmate <hi>I </hi> should choose.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Oh! I like her very much. She was very kind to me when I first came out, at the time of my
      marriage—indeed, I believe she partly arranged it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Was that a motive for gratitude—to have linked your fresh young heart to a worn-out mind
      and body of sixty-four? <stage>(rises)</stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Hush! he was very good to me—and it was my poor father's wish, not mine. Heaven knows I was
      not selfish or worldly then! But Mrs. Colonel Mac, as you call her, is so lively and
      agreeable!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Not to my taste. I find these barrack-bred women intolerable bores, with their mess-gossip
      and their regimental small talk! Then Mrs. Colonel Mac has been so long used to lead her
      husband by the nose, she imagines herself mistress wherever she sets her foot!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> I'm sure I shall be very much obliged to her for taking the management of these tiresome
      native servants off my hands.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Am I not here to do that ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Is that my fault ? But you may pay too dearly even for a lady housekeeper—it's right you
      should know she's a confirmed mischief maker! So be on your guard against Mrs. Colonel Mac;
      and above all, don't believe in the character she is likely to give you of me.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker><p>I should think, Edward,
     <stage>(rises)</stage> you need be under no apprehension on that point. I'm sorry she's
     coming, but I'm afraid it's too late to put her off—she writes from the nearest dauk-bungalow.
     It is a great nuisance. I was so happy—so comfortable, by myself. But while she's here, adieu
     to our <hi>tete-a-tete</hi> morning rides about the hills —</p></sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Our long, quiet verandah evenings, with no sound but the music of your voice—the unclouded
      moon over our heads, and before us the majestic presence of the

      mountains. Clara, it's hard to
      renounce all this. While she is here, I shall have to shut myself up in my bungalow, and
      console myself with your letters.</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> My letters !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> I have every scrap you have written to me for the last two years.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> You don't mean that you have kept the earlier ones?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Did you think I could part with them ? They revealed your heart long before you dared trust
      it to your tongue.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> I'm afraid I must have written very imprudently in those days. Edward, I wish you would
      destroy them.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Not till I hold, as husband, the hand that wrote them. But let us hope that Mrs. Colonel
      Mac won't stay for ever.</p>

     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Ah ! I'm afraid she'll be very fatiguing—she has such dreadful energy!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> You'll find yourself without a will of your own in a week. I quite agree with you, you
      can't shut your door in her face; but as soon as she's installed there's no reason why you
      should not set Ramdeholl to find a bungalow for her, hire her a khansumah, house, servants,
      and chairmen—in fact make her extremely comfortable somewhere else.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> A capital suggestion!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Let her know you've done all this quite as a matter of course, and she <hi>must</hi> take
      the hint, I think— old campaigner as she is. But I must settle with these niggers for you, and
      see old Mahdo about your ball dress.</p>

      I will release you, and we'll both retire into the bosom of our families, and wind up a
      virtuous old age— cabbage-planting. Now be off and open the trenches on Nabichull. There's one

     Here, Khansumah! Khitmugars! Coolee-wallahs! carry these things to our rooms.

     <p>That's right. Well, my dears, here we are at last, make yourselves at home.</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> <stage>(R.)</stage> Oh I told her I should bring a great deal of luggage, and she'll excuse
      a couple of nieces thrown in. That's nothing in India. It will give her lazy wretches of
      servants something to do. <stage>(looking about her)</stage> } A comfortable room enough, but
      the matting wants looking after, and the jillmills will be none the worse for a coat of
      paint—and these shrubs come too near the verandah. They'll harbour insects in the hot weather.
      However, I'll soon set all that to rights. Well, what will you take, girls—tea—beer—or
      soda-water—or will you wait for tiffin?</p>

     <p> Dear Mrs. Mac Cann, I'm so glad to see you.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs . Mc. C.</speaker>
     <p> Thank you—thank you—I've brought <pb n="17"/> you a brace of Miss Newcome's—my nieces, Katie Neil and
      Margaret Lovel. <stage>(passes Mrs. EveRsleigh to L.)</stage> They arrived at Calcutta on
      consignment to me just as I was starting, so as I had no eligible chaperon to turn them over
      to, I was forced to bring 'em along with me. After all, Clara, they're likely to do better up
      here at the Hills, than at the Station.</p>

     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>

     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Oh, bless you, they don't understand me any more than if I was talking Tarmul, do you,
      dears ? Katie is simplicity itself in a riding habit, and Patty is innocence in a mushroom
      hat. Let your people show the girls to their rooms, Clara, and help them to get their things
      in order. By the way, how many ayahs have you?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Four, I believe, besides Monee. <stage>(clapping her hands to summon them)</stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Oh ! I'm glad you've still got that pretty creature. But it is at least two too many. I
      must look into your household arrangements as soon as I've shaken down. I've no doubt I can
      cut your bills down from three to four hundred rupees a month, at least. These Hill Khansumahs
      are <hi>such</hi> rogues.</p>

     <p> Your boys?</p>

     <p> I mean the officers of ours who were on leave up here—Greenway at least—as for poor Slack,

     <p> Here she is ! Well Mrs. Colonel Mac ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs . M. </speaker>
     <stage>(C., to Greenway)</stage>
     <p>Glad to see you so rosy, my dear boy; you're looking a stone heavier for the Hills.
      <stage>(shakes hands with him)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> It's all the pleasure of seeing you. And how's the Colonel?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> In capital preservation. He'll be here soon to settle with the Major about the command of
      the regiment in his absence. This expedition may shorten your leave. Not that there seems much
      the matter with <hi>you,</hi> Greenway.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> Isn't there though? I'm very weak indeed. I was bled tremendously last night.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Bled ? I'll be bound it was by that old-fashioned Sangrado, Mc Rivet.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> No it wasn't, it was by that very expert practititioner, Stonihurst; and in the region of
      the pocket.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> What, Harry? playing again ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> Oh, Mrs. Mac, don't scold me, please—a fellow must have some excitement you know, and I've
      such a weakness for blind-hookey. But this time it's really serious.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> How much have you lost?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> I'm rather hazy about the whole affair. I gave I.O.U.'s. I am afraid it was more than
      £1,000, nearer two, I fancy.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Rupees, I hope ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> No, pounds sterling. Now don't put on your lecturing face, please. I've been lecturing
      myself all the morning, but without the least effect. But do stand my friend once more with
      the governor and with the Colonel.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> My dear boy, this is the second time. You promised me you'd never touch a card again.</p>
    </sp><pb n="19"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> And I never did, at the Station, but somehow, here, at the Hills, everybody punts more or
      less—I suppose it's something in the air—they say it's relaxing at first—and then I was so
      sprung.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Who played ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> Only our fellows, Callow and I, and the Major and Slack. The governor will insist on my
      selling out. Now do get the Colonel to say a good word for me and I will never—never— </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> You had better make no more promises. You were tipsy, you say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> Obfuscated, decidedly; mind, I don't say there was anything unfair, Stonihurst is incapable
      of that.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Of course! Of course! I suppose this has drained you?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> No ! I have just drawn the Major of a couple of ponies, half forfeit on a break-neck match
      he made last night. Mrs. Eversleigh has ordered him to cry off, it seems ; she can turn him
      round her finger, you know.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> I was not aware he knew her.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> Oh yes! they're quite thick, in fact they're giving long odds at the Club that he'll marry
      her before her year's mourning is out.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Indeed?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> I believe it's as good as settled. The Commissioner left her very well off, you know. And
      then I hear at the Club from some of the fellows in his old regiment there was a good deal of
      talk about Mrs. Eversleigh and Stonihurst—even in old Eversleigh's time, before the Major
      joined our's.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Ah! Well Harry, I'll think over your scrape, and see what I can do.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> That's a dear, kind soul! if you had been here it wouldn't have happened. You keep a fellow
      straight somehow.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> I must introduce you to my nieces—two dear good girls. If they don't bind you over to good
      behaviour I'm afraid all my scolding will be of little use.</p>
     <stage> Enter Katie and Margaret, L. D.</stage>
   
     <p>Miss Katie Neil—Miss Margaret Lovel—Mr. Greenway  <pb n="20"/>, of our's, my loves. You'll find Katie
      knows the points of a horse almost as well as you do yourself— Margaret is fresh from her
      papa's parsonage, and ought to be able to give you a better lecture than I can.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> Come along Miss Neil, I'll show you everything from the verandah, the race course, and the
      tennis court, and the mall, and the ball room, and the club, and our bungalow, and there's a
      church too, Miss Lovel, and old Ram Bux's shop, where you can buy anything from a bottle of
      mixed pickles to a perambulator.</p>
     <stage> Exit Katie, Margaret and Greenway, by verandah, L. C.</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Either of the girls might do worse. Greenway will come into a fine property—and he's a good
      lad at bottom, though his wild oats have taken a good deal of sowing. This is a heavy crop he
      has just told me of. So! Stonihurst is at his old tricks. He's the black sheep of the
      regiment, and such a clever unscrupulous fellow too! He bewitches the youngsters. They adore
      him while he devours them—So, he's trying to hook poor Clara into the bargain. Hem—I've not
      come a day too soon. I must see whether I can't outflank him at the Hills, as I've managed to
      do more than once at the Station. <stage>(she goes up to verandah)</stage> </p></sp>
     <stage> Enter Slack with Nabichull—Slack, not seeing Mrs.Mac Cann, who listens on seeing them.
     </stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack</speaker>
     <p><stage>(L.)</stage> So you won't let me have the money.</p>

     <speaker>Nabi .</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(C.)</stage> The sahib understands business, I must first see if sahib Greenway owns
      his signature—then, if he is of age, and if it's all right—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Nabi .</speaker>
     <p> I'll see about it, sahib, but it's a large sum—I must beat the Bazaar for it. Nabichull is
      very poor, but he has friends—friends who will help him. Krishna be good to them for it.

    </sp>

     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Your hand shakes sadly still, Slack— The Hills have not set you up yet.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> No, I'm afraid I'm past the Hills, and past the doctors—My poor head—it gets worse and
      worse. But I'm glad you've come: while you are here I've something to hold on to, that keeps
      me straighter than brandypawnee.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Ah, if you would but forswear that poison.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> Don't ask me: if it has made me what I am, it helps me to shut my eyes now and then to the
      wreck it has made—Give up brandy-pawnee ! You don't know the horrors it saves me from—without
      it how should I face my difficulties—that Meerut matter hanging over us —my Company's accounts
      unsettled!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> I feared as much, from what the Colonel told me.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> There's £300 wrong somehow, I can't tell how the money has gone; I only know I haven't
      taken any of it, but I'm in such a muddle ! It's gone, and I shall be broke: dishonoured:
      unless you can help me—Won't you?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Sit down, Slack. <stage>(he sits)</stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> If I might ask for some brandy-pawnee—I can't go into the figures without it. It steadies
      me.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> We must try if I can't replace brandypawnee for once. I'll help you on one condition.
      <stage>(seated, R.)</stage> That you state—in writing—without any reservation, all that
      happened at Major Stonihurst's bungalow last night, when young Greenway was fleeced at
      cards.</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Of course—only <hi>he</hi> was tipsy, and the Major was sober: he lost a large sum, and the
      Major won it. And you've been trying to negociate Greenway's I.O.U's with that old rogue
      Nabichull. You see, I'm tolerably well informed. Has Nabichull got those I.O.U's?</p>
    </sp><pb n="22"/>

     <speaker>Mr. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Tell Nabichull to let me have them.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> But if the Major asks me for them.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Refer him to me—and now go into the library and write me out the statement. That done, I'll
      see your accounts set straight, or at least the deficit made up, and then you must send in
      your papers. I'll take care there's no difficulty about <hi>them.</hi> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> I felt it was cruel to bleed the poor lad, I did indeed, but I didn't see how to prevent
      it, and I durstn't send in my papers, till my accounts were straight. I won't try to thank
      you—what are the thanks of a poor useless broken-down creature like me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Yes; one way you <hi>can</hi> thank me, Slack.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> Pray tell me how ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> By giving up this miserable habit of drinking.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> I'll try—yes, I'll try. But you don't know what a grip the devil has. But thanks to you I
      can look the future in the face now without the prospect of dishonour, and I can do something
      to make restitution too. I've a conscience, Mrs. Mac, though you mayn't think so. It don't
      prevent my doing wrong, but it makes me very uncomfortable. Heaven bless you.</p>

      climate of India knew how many sins and how many deaths it is made to answer for! This
      confession of Slack's and these I.O.U.'s may enable me to save this poor boy at all events

      ken. There's sae many red coats buz, buzzing about her, I thought a black one might be a kind
      o' relief.</p>

     <speaker>Tunst .</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(L.)</stage> I tell the Doctor he's wrong, Mrs. Mac Cann. We who don't belong to the
      service are little better than pariahs off our own walks, so I've come up to be duly snubbed
      by your Queen of Beauty and pooh-poohed by her military train.</p>

     <p> Mr. Tunstall! <stage>(with emotion, recognizing him)</stage></p></sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mc Riv</speaker><p>Eh ! what's this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tunst .</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(embarrassed)</stage> I was not prepared to find an old friend in Mrs.
      Eversleigh.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Mr. Tunstall, it's a long time since we met.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tunst .</speaker>
     <p> So long that it is almost a pity to renew our intercourse. We can never be to each other as
      strangers—still less as intimates.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Mr. Tunstall and I knew each other in England, Doctor, very intimately—almost as boy and
      girl.</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mc Riv.</speaker>
     <p> Ah ! <stage>(Mrs. Mac Cann and Mc Rivett retire up)</stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tunst .</speaker>
     <p> I was aware you had come to India. I heard you were married. I did not ask your husband's
      name, I am sorry now I did not. Good morning, Mrs. Eversleigh.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mc Riv.</speaker>
     <p> Hoot, hoot, Mrs. Eversleigh ! you're no gaun to let the man run awa' that gait like a
      scaudit colly. Mrs. Colonel Mac, you and me'll just hae a twa-handed crack, and leave them to
      anastomose a bit.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> So they are old friends, Doctor; was ever anything so fortunate ? <stage>(Mrs. Colonel Mac
      Cann and Doctor Mc Rivett retire up C.)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tunst .</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(L.)</stage> You will readily believe, Mrs Eversleigh, I did not seek this
      meeting.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> <stage>(R.)</stage> But if we do not seek, there is no reason why we should shun each
      other. We are wiser than when we parted eight years ago.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tunst .</speaker>
     <p> Yes; we ought to have learnt to wear our masks by this time. And after all, why look back
      with pain on the past ? It was all for the best. Had our boy and girl love gone on, you would
      never have drawn a great prize in the Indian marriage lottery, and I should not have made a
      fortune and lost a constitution in Calcutta.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> I hope your life has been happier than mine.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tunst .</speaker>
     <p> Happier! Have we not both been eminently successsful! Happiness was our dream as boy and
      girl—we know <hi>now</hi> that the thing to look for is solid pudding. You attained that
      philosophy before I did—it is seldom reached at eighteen by a woman.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> I was very weak and very helpless, and my father's will had always been law to me—but I was
      not fickle or worldly—I suffered very deeply from our separation—I should suffer still more if
      I thought you were expressing your real feelings—But I see you are speaking out of the
      bitterness of your heart, that you wish to make <hi>me</hi> feel now some of the pain I caused
      <hi>you</hi> long ago.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tunst .</speaker>
     <p> Forgive me—I am talking foolishly as well as cruelly—it is little use either blaming or
      regretting. Dr. McRivett tells me you have lost your husband.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Eleven months ago.</p>
    </sp><pb n="25"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tunst .</speaker>
     <p> Then your tie to India is severed?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Yes—I am only waiting for the cold weather, and a little more strength to leave the
      country—oh, how eagerly!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tunst .</speaker>
     <p> I am glad of that—there will be less danger in recalling old recollections together—I am
      frightfully home-sick. To retrace with you our Derbyshire village life will work in me either
      a cure or a —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> It shall be a cure—we must prescribe for each other. <stage>They go off by verandah L.

     <stage>Dr . Mac Rivett and Mrs. Colonel Mac Cann come down. </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mac Riv .</speaker>
     <p> Now Mrs. Eversleigh's is one of the cases of the mischief this infernal India is working in
      a hunder' English hearts and homes—if it hadn't been for India she and Tunstall would have
      been a sonsy London couple by this time—he pocketin' his fees and she rearing her weans under
      their vine and fig-tree aboot Russell Square.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> <stage>(R.)</stage> Don't be unfair, Doctor—young girls married rich old men, and
      barristers mortgaged their constitutions for fees before India was invented.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Macriv .</speaker>
     <p> And sae there was gold found before we lighted on the diggin's. Now, Mrs. Mac, ye're nae
      the woman to dispose o' yon two young nieces o' yours to the highest bidder, if it was no' for
      the facilities afforded by the Calcutta market.</p>

     <speaker>Mrs .Mac C.</speaker>
     <p> But do me the justice to say that whenever I put out my advertisement of "Wanted a

    <sp>

     <p> Hoot, hoot, Mrs. Mac, I'm ashamed o' ye— I tell ye India plays mair havoc in hames and

     <p> <stage>(L.)</stage> Puir things, puir things! Mrs. Mac, I never see symptoms of marriage in
      India, Mrs. Mac, but the awfu' sequel rise up to my mind's eye, separations of parents and
      children, partings o' husband and wife—Deil hae me, Mrs. Mac, but making a marriage in India
      is just an awful responsibility.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mac C.</speaker>
     <p> Never mind the Doctor, my dears, he's the monkey who lost his tail. Of all the desperate

     <speaker>Mrs. Mac C.</speaker>
     <p> He'd have received an answer that would have cured him of proposing for the rest of his

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Yes, at her age, and in her position, she requires a friend of her own sex. These Hill

     <p> She did so, before she had the advantage of your protection. Now, mark me—dare to breathe
      one word against me, to take one step in furtherance of this new old friend's interests to the
      prejudice of mine, and I place in his hands evidence that will leave her reputation blighted
      beyond redemption. You know me—and you know whether, when I threaten, I threaten idly.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> And this is the woman you pretended to love !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> The woman I do love as well as I can love anything. But my interest is at stake here as
      well as my affections. I might trample down the one, but I can't sacrifice the other, so
      beware !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Then this is a declaration of war.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> It is, but with every attention to good breeding. While we are cutting each other's
      throats, there's no reason anybody else should suspect we're not on the best terms in the
      world.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> As you please. The English and French were very polite to each other at Fontenoy, but I
      never heard they fought the worse for it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> On the contrary. Small swords would not be nearly so deadly if they were not so highly
      polished. So, au revoir, and war to the death. <stage>(bows politely and exit, L.
      C.)</stage></p>

     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> So, the trenches are opened! Stonihurst is an adversary worth checkmating.</p>
     <stage> Enter Monee, L. C.</stage>
     <p>Ah, my pretty little Monee ! <stage>(Monee kneels to Mrs. Mac Cann and clings round her
      knees weeping)</stage> Why, what's the matter?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Monee .</speaker>
     <p> Let me wait on you, mem sahib. I dare not be near <hi>her</hi> now.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> What, Monee, quarrel with so kind a mistress ?</p>
    </sp><pb n="31"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Monee .</speaker>
     <p> No, not quarrel; but <hi>he</hi> loves her. It makes me mad—bad thoughts come to Monee at
      night as the burra bee-bee lies asleep.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> What's this? Jealous of her mistress! Ah ! if it <hi>should</hi> be—do you mean the Major,
      Monee?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Monee .</speaker>
     <p> Yes, yes ; there is no word—no look for Monee now—oh, take me away—take me where I shall
      never see him.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Poor girl! How long have you known him, Monee?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Monee .</speaker>
     <p> Long, long—many moons—I never counted them. I was so happy. I used to carry the mem sahib's
      letters to his bungalow—he told me he wrote them that I might bring him the answers.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> When was this?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Monee .</speaker>
     <p> Long ago, before the burrah sahib Eversleigh died.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> In her husband's lifetime—ha! The arms he threatened to use against her good name—should
      they be those very letters ! Did you take many letters, Monee?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Monee .</speaker>
     <p> Many, many, every day. I was so glad to take them, for I saw <hi>him.</hi> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Did he keep them ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Monee .</speaker>
     <p> Yes, in a steel casket. I used to put them there when he was absent. It is full of them. He
      used to laugh at the mem sahib for writing so much.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Do you know where the casket is now, Monee ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Monee .</speaker>
     <p> Always at his bungalow—he never parts with it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Could Monee get it for the mem sahib ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Monee .</speaker>
     <p> Why Monee get it?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Because I am sorry for Monee—I want to bring back her peace. There is a charm in those
      letters —if Monee gets it, her pain will go.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Monee .</speaker>
     <p> Monee's love is her pain; she does not wish to lose it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> But what if his love for the burra bee-bee go too with those letters ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Monee .</speaker>
     <p> Then Monee take them if they kill her for it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> <stage>(aside)</stage> Now is the time, while he is here. Monee, bring me that casket—no
      one must see you bring it me, or the spell will be broken.</p>
    </sp><pb n="32"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Monee .</speaker>
     <p> Monee will take care. Oh! may Krishma bless the mem sahib for this ! Monee will creep
      through the compound like a snake. She'll be back before the shadows of the verandah pillars
      are there. <stage>(points, and exit rapidly)</stage>.} </p>

     <p> Here is the statement—the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. It will
      compromise both of us. But it was <hi>Stonihurst's</hi> plan to rook the poor lad; we made him
      drink on purpose. Mind, you'll bear me harmless from <hi>him,</hi> and you will help me out of
      the hole with my accounts.</p>

     <p> Out of my misery at last. If ever I fall again let me sink without a helping hand. Ah! you

      straight with myself was a greater kindness still. <stage>Exit, R. C.</stage></p>

     <p> Yes. I hoped I might do a little teaching among the poor heathen children ! but I don't

     <speaker>Marg .</speaker>
     <p> But it's our duty to teach them, poor things, and set them an example of industry and

     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> <stage>(L.)</stage> He will go, Isabella—though we haven't exhausted our chapter of
      Derbyshire recollections; they do expand so by talking about.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tunst .</speaker>
     <p> If I obeyed my inclinations I should remain; but I must get back to advise in the cases
      which have followed me even up to the Hills—and <stage>(sighs)</stage> you forget, that after
      each of our imaginary journeys home, I've to get back all the way to India alone. <stage>Exit,
      L. C.</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Poor Tunstall!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Say poor Clara, when you're about it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> I was thinking of his loneliness.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> And what a pity it was you couldn't find a companion to cheer it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Where shall I find a woman worthy of him?</p></sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mrs. Mc C.</speaker><p>  Why should you go from home ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Isabella, you forget Major Stonihurst. We are as good as engaged.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Say as <hi>bad</hi> as engaged, my dear.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> I forgot your prejudice against him—I had hoped it was removed.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> It is. 'Till this visit I admit I was prejudiced—now I am convinced.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Of what?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> That he is a man to whom no self-respecting woman should entrust her heart, or her
      fortune.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Ah ! he warned me against you.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Then I'm only returning the compliment.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> What have you to allege against him ? Is he not brave ?</p>
    </sp><pb n="38"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> As an old robber knight.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Accomplished?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> As the serpent that tempted Eve.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> A born captain and master, wherever men are met together.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> So was Lucifer — but now for the per contra. Imprimis—he is a gambler.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> The consequence of idleness and ennui— nine tenths of our officers in India play.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Granted. But let us hope not even the other tenth conspire to rob in playing.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> What do you mean?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Read this paper—it contains the confession of Major Stonihurst's accomplice in a regular
      scheme to intoxicate and plunder at cards, young Greenway. Here are the lad's I.O.U.'s for the
      money he lost to Stonihurst.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Is it possible ? But who knows if this accomplice's confession can be trusted!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> We won't trust it, till corroborated by the Major's own acts. I do not say he does not feel
      a strong passion for you; but I do say, that it is less potent than his desire for your
      fortune.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> What more have you to bring against him?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> He is a profligate. You wonder at the change in your pretty young Monee—her shrinking from
      you—the mistress whom she used almost to worship. Monee loves Stonihurst.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> I will not believe it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Ask the poor girl herself—or rather do not ask her—watch her while the Major is in her
      sight— you will need no other proof.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> And I am bound to this man!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Not yet, happily.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> The whole Station looks upon our marriage as a settled thing.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> It will not be the first time that the whole Station has jumped to a false conclusion.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> What am I to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Throw him over—boldly and decisively. If he asks you why, tell him what I have told you,
      and dare him to disprove. Meantime, think on what I have <pb n="39"/> told you—be on your guard—commit
      yourself to no further promise—put him to what test you please—and remember, if he threaten,
      you have two friends not easily frightened—John Tunstall, Barrister, and Colonel Isabella Mc
      Cann. <stage> Exit, R. door.</stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> <stage>(pressing her hands to her temples)</stage> Can all this be true ? Is this a dream ?
      I will <hi>not</hi> believe it— easy to say I will not; but I cannot sweep her words from my
      mind. I can never again feel the faith I felt yesterday. Oh, that I had never known him!—that
      I had never loved him !—or, having loved, that I had never doubted! What shall I do ?—what
      shall I do ? Hark ! his voice ! <stage>(she runs to the verandah)</stage> He comes this way. I
      cannot face him now. Heaven give me strength and guidance against the moment when I
      <hi>must</hi> meet him ! <stage> Exit, L . door. </stage></p>

     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(l. C.)</stage> Clara not here! just as well—I must rearrange my plan of campaign.
      This letter from Mrs. Mac Cann's worser half—who takes rank and pay as Colonel of the 120th,
      while his wife <hi>does</hi> the duties—is an arrow from <hi>her</hi> quiver—who can have

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(R., in agitation)</stage> Well met, Stonihurst, I heard you were here—I've just had
      a letter from the Colonel.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(coolly, L.)</stage> So have I.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> But mine contains what should be very awkward news for some people.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> So does mine.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> He has heard of these I. O. U.'s of Greenway's— he says he means to insist on the lad's
      demanding a court of inquiry.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Exactly what he tells me.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> Have you considered the consequences of an inquiry ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> The certain cashiering of Edward Stonihurst, major, and Thomas Slack, captain.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> And you can contemplate these consequences as calmly and as coolly —</p>
    </sp><pb n="40"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> I have yet to learn that flurry is the best way of meeting danger.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> What do you mean to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Put my ball in baulk by blocking this inquiry.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> You'll confess.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Confess! my poor Slack, you've not had your proper allowance of peg this morning—time
      enough to confess when you are found out. The Colonel only knows the pigeon has been plucked;
      he's in the dark as to the poulterers—I'll point out to him the scandal an inquiry will bring
      on the regiment, and suggest how it may be rendered unnecessary by inducing the rooks to
      disgorge their plunder.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> You'll return Greenway's I.O.U.'s ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> As I can't keep 'em. Burking this inquiry is worth more than £2,000 to <hi>us.</hi> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> To <hi>us</hi> ?—to <hi>you.</hi> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> We are Siamese twins—hurt one—the other must feel it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> I don't know that—I'm not quite so sensitive as I was.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> I'm glad of that; you wanted casehardening— and now I look at you, you are amazingly
      improved—eye clear, comparatively—hand steady, all but—by Jove, you're a new man!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> I am a new man—at least I'm in progress of repair—half of me is new, and the other half is
      in course of renewal. I'm going to send in my papers.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Your papers! but how about your Company accounts ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(proudly)</stage> I've sent them to the paymaster, balanced.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> No wonder you're elated—balancing is a feat so much out of your line; I thought you were
      £300 short.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> So I was, but a friend has dubbed up—and I'm a free man.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Give me back those I.O.U.'s of Greenway's.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> I haven't got them.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Where are they ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> I handed them over to Nabichull as you told me.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> You must get them back for me at once.</p>
    </sp><pb n="41"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> Get 'em yourself.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Slack, you're drunk!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> No, that's just it—I'm sober.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Ah, I meant you were not yourself—it comes to the same thing; now don't wax fat and kick,
      my dear Slack, in this unfamiliar consciousness of sobriety—but go, like a good fellow, and do
      what you are bid.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> I don't intend to do your bidding any longer, Stonihurst; if you want your I.O.U.'s, get
      your I.O.U.'s— I'm tired of playing the monkey to your hot chesnuts.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> So this explains the Colonel's letter. Slack, you've peached to Mrs. Colonel Mac about this
      aftair of Greenway's.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> Eh I peached?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> This £300 is the price of your treachery.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> Don't bully; I won't stand bullying—I'm not your slave now.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> No; you've changed your situation for an advance of wages.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> Come, Major Stonihurst—I'll thank you to remember I'm an officer and a gentleman.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> How can I be expected to remember it, my good fellow, after I've used you so long as a tool
      and a turnspit ? You're quite right to send in your papers; Her Majesty's livery is the only
      one you are not worthy of wearing.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Slack .</speaker>
     <p> And was I worthier to wear it when I was your creature—alternately your decoy and your
      victim. Aye, look down on me in the pride of your stony heart. I am prouder of <hi>my</hi>
      weakness, than of <hi>your</hi> strength. Conscience may have made me a coward, but you are
      not more a man for wanting it. <stage>Exit, L. C.</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Bravo, Mrs. Colonel Mac; I must admit you play your game well. Nothing like buying up a
      traitor. Luckily I have discovered the purchase in time. I must return the I.O.U.'s; but,
      then, how to raise the thousand pounds I want for the Meerut settling ? If I don't pay up, I
      shall be posted as a defaulter. Here's a dilemma ! Cashiering on the one hand, levanting on
      the other—I'm between the devil and the deep sea, with a vengeance ! Well, I've been in
      scrapes as bad, <pb n="42"/>and brought a whole skin out of them. I must drive matters to an issue with
      Clara. Her fortune will make everything square. This woman little knows the absoluteness of my
      influence over her yielding nature. Here she comes, now for my coup d'état !</p>

    </sp>     <stage> Enter Mrs. Eversleigh, door, L . </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(R.)</stage> I'm lucky, my dear Clara, in finding you alone at last. Mr. Tunstall
      has been such a constant visitor of late.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> <stage>(L.)</stage> Surely you would not grudge me the recollections of old times—the
      society of an old friend ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> I've no quarrel with the old times; a more jealous lover might, perhaps, object to the old
      friend, when he comes in the shape of a smooth-spoken lawyer; but I'm not disposed to be
      jealous.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> <stage>(ironically)</stage> Thank you—you are very kind. Then I may see my old playmate now
      and then?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> As often as you please, after we are married. My dear Clara, I've done suit and service
      this many a weary month; will you not give me my reward at last ? Let us fix the day.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Before my year's mourning has expired! Do not press it, Edward.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Clara, if your love were like mine, you would not allow an empty form to stand between us
      and happiness. I have only listened to my heart.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Are you quite sure of that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> What do you mean, Clara ? Is is possible you can doubt the disinterestedness of my
      attachment ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Edward, were I poor, as I am rich, would you be as eager for this marriage ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> There is suspicion in your very question. I guess who has prompted it. I warned you against
      this woman; you see suspicion of me has followed her into your house—into your heart. I have
      not deserved this, Clara. <stage>(turns as if to hide emotion)</stage> But from the moment
      that confidence is at an end, it is idle to talk of love. This is no longer a place for me!
      <stage>(he turns as if to go)</stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Stay, Edward; do not leave me.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Clara, I am not disposed to play the tyrant, and <pb n="43"/> even if I were disposed, I have no right.
      But I cannot condescend to clear myself of such suspicions as you have hinted. It is enough
      for me to know their source. Either this Tunstall is kept at a becoming distance, and that
      woman leaves the house, or I never set foot in it again.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> A generous nature should not be so quick to take offence. Whatever Mrs. Mc Cann may have
      said against you, it is in your own power to disprove.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Disprove ! Am I on trial then ? Is your new friend, Mr. Tunstall, to sit in judgment on me
      ? How do I know the judge may not be interested in the result of the case.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> I can listen to no imputation on Mr. Tunstall, even from <hi>you,</hi> Edward.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Forgive me, Clara; make some allowance for the susceptibility of ardent love—leave no room
      for the hideous working of jealousy—of doubt in <hi>me</hi> and suspicion in yourself. I love
      you truly—passionately. Be my wife at once !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> On one condition —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> I will have no conditions; consider well if it is you or I who should impose them.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> What do you mean?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Your love, Clara, is not a thing of yesterday. It dates back for years—to a time when you
      were still the wife of another. It has been recorded, not in words that can be unsaid as
      easily as spoken, but in written pages— pages that have been my comfort and solace, 'till now,
      but which, at need, may be my weapons for self-defence and justification.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> You would not use my letters against me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> And why not ? You have suspicions that dishonour <hi>me</hi> —you are giving way to them. I
      have what the world calls proofs, that discredit you, and I will use them if you will not be
      my wife. Do you think I will sit by in silence, to see you become the wife of another. I will
      give you time to consider well. Fling aside these doubts, and be my wife at once; or act upon
      them and take the consequences of throwing Edward Stonihurst over, for John Tunstall.
      <stage>Exit, L. C.</stage></p>

     <p> This threat from him ! Become his wife from <pb n="44"/>fear, or see my letters made food for public
      comment— every equivocal word in them wrested to my shame !— my brain swims ! What shall I do

     <p>Isabella! he has threatened me !</p>

     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> I have overheard all, Clara. Now judge him by your own reason—your own sense of what is due
      from man to woman. You have put your good name in this man's power.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> I was only imprudent.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> <hi>Only</hi> imprudent! And he asks you to choose between marriage with him and exposure.
      Would one who really loved you have offered such an alternative ? Setting love aside, would a
      generous man have stooped to such a weapon ? Can you conceive Tunstall using it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> No, no. But what is to be done ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> If he repeats his threat defy him to produce the letters: this may drive him to show his
      hand ; at least it will teach him you are not so easily terrified as he imagines.</p>

     <speaker>Mc Riv.</speaker>
     <p> 'Deed ha'e I. Thank your bonnie Margaret for it. She's doon at the schule. I tell you it
      was the pleasantest sicht I've seen since I clapped eyes on my brevet o'
      Superintendent-General of Hospitals. The bonnie English lassie, wi' her fair face and gentle
      voice, and a' the brown bairnies clinging aboot her, wonderin' if it was na' their ain Krishna
      come down amang them on a mission o' mercy.</p>
    </sp><pb n="45"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> It must have been very pretty indeed; but I want you to do me a favour; my dear old husband
      is as brave as a lion; but he's too old for Hill service. I want you to certify to the fact,
      and further to certify that Stonihurst is quite fit for duty.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mc Riv.</speaker>
     <p> But certificates canna' he given at wull, ye ken. I maun ha'e data <stage>(pronounce "

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Ah, you know well enough, you doctors can always find reasons, or make them. Then, besides
      that, I want you to frighten Mrs. Eversleigh from the Hills and back to Calcutta at once, en
      route for England.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mc Riv.</speaker>
     <p> 'Deed and I'll do that, for she's not quite tough enough for India; and ther'll be Tunstall
      to escort her down to the coast. It'll be a chance for him, puir lad.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Only manage all this, Doctor, and I don't know what I won't do for you. I'll even pretend
      to be ill myself and call <hi>you</hi> in to prescribe for me.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mc Riv.</speaker>
     <p> That's a strong temptation; but ye might find a stronger. Ca' me in to prescribe for your
      bonny niece.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Pooh ! she doesn't want the doctor.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mc Riv.</speaker>
     <p> Na ! but perhaps the doctor wants her ! Aye, you may stare ; it's a fac', Saunders Mac
      Rivit has caught the epidemic at last; and it's like the measles, the mair dangerous the
      aulder the patient,</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> What does Margaret say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mc Riv.</speaker>
     <p> I've nae asked her. But ye ken my position, Mrs. Mac; I've earned my retiring pension ;
      I've saved half a lac to boot. I'm no jest a young man; but I've a constitution like bent
      leather; and as for my principles—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> I know they're as stout as your constitution. If Margaret consents, so do I.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mc Riv.</speaker>
     <p> And the lassie's parents ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Oh, I never allow girls to be consigned to me without carte blanche as to all future
      arrangements. If I'm satisfied, that's sufficient.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mc Riv.</speaker>
     <p> I'll awa' down to see her up frae' the schule. Odd ! she'll ha'e me for her scholar the
      noo—my education has been sair negleckit. I learned the verb "amo," I love, in Adam's Latin
      Grammar, at Aberdeen High Skule; but I'm thinking Miss Margaret'll no' be satisfied with my
      auld fashioned parsing o't. <stage>Exit, L. C.</stage></p>
    </sp><pb n="46"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> So Margaret has brought down her man before Katie. I've observed the quiet girls generally
      do kill soonest. I must think for Clara, now. Shall I tell her these letters are in
      <hi>my</hi> hands ? It would relieve her anxiety; but it would spare her the lesson she sadly
      wants. Yes, it's decidedly for her good to sit on thorns a little longer. But that's no reason
      I should sit on thorns beside her, as I shall, till these letters are destroyed. I must find
      the means of opening this troublesome casket. If Monee can't steal the key she might steal the
      impression of it. Yes, I'll try it <stage>(goes up stage)</stage> Monee! Yonder she crouches,
      poor girl. I'll borrow an inch of this wax taper. <stage>(cuts off piece of taper that stands
      on table)</stage> </p>
     <stage> Enter Monee, L. C.</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Monee is a good girl: she has brought the casket; but that is not enough. I must burn the
      letters, or the spell will not be broken. Cannot Monee find the key?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Monee .</speaker>
     <p> I told the mem sahib—he carries it always on his chain—here ! <stage>(points to her
      breast)</stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> But at night ?</p>
     <p>Monee It is under his pillow. There are the watchmen about his verandah.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> If Monee cannot get the key, cannot she get an impression of it ? Look, here is a piece of
      soft wax. <stage>(shows it)</stage> Monee will wait in the verandah. When the sahib Stonihurst
      comes, she must watch her opportunity, and then press this wax against the key—she
      understands.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Monee .</speaker>
     <p> Yes, yes—anything to kill his love for the burra bee-bee. Give Monee the wax—she will
      watch— she will do as the mem sahib bids her. <stage>Exit, L. C.</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Meanwhile, I must put the casket in a safe place. I dread every moment Stonihurst may find
      it is gone. I know he will stick at nothing to recover it. <stage>(calls Clara, L.)</stage></p>
     <stage> Enter Mrs. Eversleigh, L. door. </stage>
     <p>What is the safest lock-up place in the bungalow ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> You know how little we trust such fastenings <pb n="47"/> in India—but this cabinet has a strong and
      intricate lock. I keep my jewels in it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> I've a box here which I wish to deposit in safety—the contents are very valuable. May I
      lock it up in your cabinet?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Certainly—here's the key. <stage>(takes the key, and opens cabinet —Mrs. Mc Cann shews

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Let me look at that casket. Yes—it's the same, or a counterpart, of one I brought out with
      me— it was Tunstall's first and last present. I lost it two years ago. Where did you get
      it?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> From Monee.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Monee ! She was not in my service when I lost it; besides, the girl is as honest as the
      day.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Did you know Stonihurst at the time you missed it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> Yes — I remember he used to admire the casket: and asked me for it. He must have stolen it
      in a jest, and given it to Monee since. <stage>(she locks casket in cabinet, and puts the key
      in her pocket —Monee in verandah suddenly springs up, and utters a short cry; then stands
      gazing eagerly)</stage> </p>

     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> What is the matter with Monee ?—Look at her.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Stonihurst is in sight—I'm certain of it. Clara, will you be guided by me?—watch his
      meeting with Monee, from behind the purdah. In your present relations with him, you have the
      fullest right to use all weapons—open or concealed.</p>

     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> The game grows critical. I must oust this woman, or she will oust me. I have left time for

     <p> I am unwilling to suppose you ungenerous. Come, confess that that threat was only meant to

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Do not buoy yourself up with that hope. I told you before—I tell you still—I have kept
      every word you ever wrote to me.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> With a view to turn them to this use?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> No—for love of her who wrote them—but if this love be at an end, though they may be useless
      for my consolation, they will serve my just revenge. You still doubt. What if I show you these
      glowing mementos of happiness—these terrible witnesses against you?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>

     <p> The casket is gone from my bungalow—it was there last week ; my servants deny all knowledge
      of its disappearance. The watchmen declare no strangers have been seen about the place. This
      is not the work of a chance thief—who, who can have done this ! Who but this infernal
      sleepless enemy—this bold player who has pitted her wits against mine ! Thus far she has made
      the highest score—but the game is not over yet. Yet how or why can she have got possession of
      the casket ? Clara may have told her of the use I intended to make of the letters, but she did
      not know I had the casket, still less that it contained them. Hark ! her footstep—let me try
      an ambuscade. <stage>(he retires to verandah)</stage> </p>
     <stage> Re-enter Mrs. Colonel Mc Cann with the key of the cabinet — she opens it and takes out
      the box. </stage>

     <p> Oh—this casket?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p> Yes; stolen by you from my bungalow last week.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Pardon me, stolen by you from Mrs. Eversleigh's bungalow two years ago.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> It was a gift—or if not, a theft which love prompted and which love will excuse. Give it
      back.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> No. <stage>(she rapidly replaces it in the cabinet and re-locks the door)</stage> If you

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> An unfair and unmanly one. You hope by help of them to frighten her into marriage. Happily
      the box and its contents are in my possession.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Yes! but not the key which gives access to them. Here it is—it never quits this chain.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Ah ! caskets may be opened without keys.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> You will find this one difficult to open by any means within your reach. I warn you, by
      fair means or by foul I mean to recover that casket, and when I do, I will place it instantly
      in the hands of Mr. Tunstall.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> We shall see.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(with a sudden change of tone)</stage> Mrs. Mac Cann, I admire you immensely.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Thank you.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> I was never so well matched in my life!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> You flatter me.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Come—if heads like ours were allies instead of enemies, we might do a great deal.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> I prefer hunting single.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> I presume we are both too clear-headed, and too superior to humbug to pretend to purely
      disinterested motives—I love Clara, as I told you, and within the limits of my nature,
      genuinely and passionately. But I don't mean to say that even my passion would make me so
      eager for this marriage were she not rich, as well as <pb n="53"/> beautiful. You, I take it, know the value
      of a rich and fashionable friend, as well as I do the advantage of a wealthy wife. You think
      by ousting me to establish yourself firmly as amie de la maison here, which, with Clara's
      hatred of trouble, means much the same thing as mistress of the house. Come, what terms will
      induce you to a compromise—to act as energetically in my cause as you have acted against me
      ?</p>
     <stage> Exit, L . </stage>
     <p>Mrs. Mc C. I'm delighted at your frankness, it is so refreshing. I will be as frank. I
      <hi>do</hi> know the advantages of a wealthy well-established fashionable friend, as well as
      you do those of a rich wife. I like to know where my luxurious room is always ready, and my
      knife and fork laid at a well-appointed table. But, I would sooner lie on straw, and eat rice
      for the rest of my life, than have spoken as you spoke just now, and yet, dare to call myself
      a gentleman! I defy your efforts—be they by force or fraud— and I repel your offers of
      compromise with the scorn that becomes a woman, and that woman the wife of a man who wears
      with honor the uniform which you disgrace.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Oh, that there were but something here—man or beast—that I might vent my fury on! First to
      recover these letters! They must still be there—the lock is cunning —the key has never left
      me. This cabinet may easily be broken open. Monee can easily get rid of the watchmen for me
      to-night—it will not be the first time. Poor girl! how her true love stands out in the light
      of her mistress's fickle, feeble flame! Curse the heartless coquette! Because her eyes are
      blue, her skin white, I must turn from my poor Monee's dusk beauty, and fling her love aside
      like an emptied flask. <stage>(Monee creeps down from verandah, and listens with passionate
      eagerness)</stage> And all because Anglo-Indian rules of caste are stern against the union of
      the conqueror and the conquered! Why should I stoop to these trammels?—I have laughed at
      stronger ones. I have defied convention—broken the pale of morals ; not always stopped before
      the banner of law ; and shall this frail reed-fence of caste stop me ? No, I will gratify love
      and vengeance at once. I will proclaim the dark girl my wife, and make this haughty<pb n="54"/>
      white-skinned lady creep and quail in the glare of her own shame ! What matter that the
      letters were only the utterances of imprudence ? They read like the shamelessness of guilt.
      Yes, Monee, you have deserved this reward for your long and humble devotion—you shall have
      it.</p>

     <p> May I ask the reason of this change of quarters.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Yes—I suspected you would break in, and I didn't wish her to be alarmed.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> And had you no fears for yourself?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Oh, dear, no! I've strong nerves—a clear conscience—and an excellent revolver—so I am armed

     <p> For what purpose ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> That I may satisfy her I am still in possession of her letters.</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> I think it would be a pity to break her first sleep.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Then, if you will not, I will. I must place her own letters before her eyes. I know she has
      ceased to love me, for she has ceased to trust. I would not have her now, were she to crawl on
      her knees. But I will have her at my feet suing for mercy, that I may have the pleasure of
      rejecting her prayer.</p>

     <p> Only a burglarious entrance into the bungalow, by Major Stonihurst; I always knew he was a
      man of very varied accomplishments, but I was not aware till to-night, that they included
      housebreaking.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mc Riv.</speaker>
     <p> Hech, sirs; but this is a queer world we live in! Explain, Major.</p>
    </sp><pb n="59"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> I came here to recover this casket—stolen from my bungalow, by this lady's contrivance.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tunst .</speaker>
     <p> That casket ? One moment—yes—it is my present to Clara, Mrs. Eversleigh, long, long
      ago.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> I know nothing of its early history: all I know- is, it has been mine for two years. The
      best proof of that will be found in its contents, and in my possession of the key. It is here.
      Shall I open it, Mrs. Eversleigh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. E. </speaker>
     <p> How am I interested in the question ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> One word. <stage>(aside to her)</stage> It contains your letters!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> <stage>(aside to Clara)</stage> Be firm, it is too late now, let him do his worst.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Well, shall I open it? Silence gives consent. Tunstall, I entrust the papers in this casket
      to your perusal—your private perusal, if you please—you will then return them to me, for such
      use as I think proper to make of them. <stage>(he hands the key to Tunstall)</stage>
      <stage>(aside to Mrs. Mac)</stage> Who wins now?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> I do.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tunst .</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(taking paper from casket)</stage> What is this? <stage>(reads)</stage> "Full
      statement of Thomas Slack, of what occurred at Major Stonihurst's bungalow, on the night of
      the 4th of August," and these ? I.O.U's to a large amount, addressed to Major
      Stonihurst—signed Frederick Greenway! <stage>(Stonihurst stands confounded)</stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Be good enough to hand them over to Major Stonihurst, for such use as he thinks proper to
      make of them. <stage>(the rest whisper)</stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(aside to Mrs. Mac)</stage> I'm at your mercy!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> I will use my victory magnanimously <stage>(aloud to all)</stage> I see now the motive of
      the Major's burglary—he wanted a coup-de-theatre, to introduce to all the parties concerned
      this avowal of his share in Greenway's losses, and the reparation he is ready to make for it.
      Those are Greenway's I.O.U.s.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> Which, I thus publicly restore to the very green young gentleman who gave them.
      <stage>(across, L.)</stage> I hope this lesson will not be thrown away <stage>(Mrs. Mc Cann
      gives him a look)</stage> on any of us. <stage>(aside to Mrs. Mac)</stage> You have conquered
      me twice over. <stage>(aloud)</stage> I have more surprises for you. Dr. Mc Rivett, having
      certified that Colonel Mc Cann is <pb n="60"/> unfit for this expedition against the Khoords, as the
      officer next in command, I have volunteered for it—but, before I go, I invite all here to my
      marriage ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>All .</speaker>
     <p> Your marriage!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mc Riv.</speaker>
     <p> With our fair friend here, of course.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> No, my dear Doctor, Mrs. Eversleigh is going to change her name, but for that of
      Tunstall—not Stonihurst.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mc Riv.</speaker>
     <p> Then who is the happy woman?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> One not quite so fair, though neither less faithful nor less fond—she is here <stage>(he
      takes Monee by the hand and brings her forward)</stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>All .</speaker>
     <p> Monee!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mc Riv.</speaker>
     <p> Man ! this is the best thing I ever heard o' ye yet.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Green .</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(aside to Katie)</stage> Marry a nigger! only think, Katie!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Katie .</speaker>
     <p> And why shouldn't a dark horse come in a winner? <stage>(Greenway and Katie cross behind to
      R. C.)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> Stonihurst, this redeems much—the rest I leave to time and conscience. For your Meerut
      settling you may look to me.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stoni .</speaker>
     <p> I go on a desperate service. If I never return <stage>(to Mrs. Mc C.)</stage> <hi>you</hi>
      will take care of <hi>her.</hi> If I do come back I trust it may be with a name that may wipe
      out something of the stain that now lies dark upon me. Henceforth my lot lies here.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Mc C. </speaker>
     <p> And yours, you happy folks, at home! The sooner you're there the better! For whatever the
      fresh breezes of the Himalayahs may do for Indian constitutions, it's clear to me that the
      moral atmosphere of dear old England is far more conducive to health and married happiness
      than the air "Up at the Hills."</p>
