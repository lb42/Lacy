   <head>THE LOAN OF A LOVER.</head>
   <stage type="setting"> Scene — Gardens of a Villa on the Canal, near Utrecht. The tower of the
    Cathedral is seen in the distance. In E. corner of the Garden, overlooking the Canal, is a
    Summer House, in the Dutch taste. </stage>
   <stage> Enter Swyzel and Delve, L. 2 E. </stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Do as you're bid, and no reflections. Don't you know the mistress is the master ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Del.</speaker>
    <p> Well, but now really, Mynheer Swyzel—to put out the orange-trees before the white frosts are
     over—is that common sense ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> What have you to do with common sense ? Nothing at all, or you would not pretend to have
     more than your mistress. It is Mamzelle Ernestine's pleasure to turn the orangery into a
     ball-room, and turned it must be.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Del.</speaker>
    <p> But the trees will die.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Let 'em die, then—that's their business; yours is to clear the place out, according to
     order. About it without more words! If she told me to fling all the Schiedam in the cellar into
     the canal, I should do so, without hesitation.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Del.</speaker>
    <p> You'd fling yourself after it, I'm sure.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Not when it was mixed with water, you rogue! or while the baron has money enough to buy
     more. Come —to work! to work ! or you'll not get the-room ready by midnight.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Del.</speaker>
    <p> O, my poor orange trees—they'll die, every one of them! <stage>Exit Delve, L.</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Silly fellow, to trouble his head about what does not concern him. If his employers take no
     care for their own interests, why should he fidget about them ? He hasn't the slightest notion
     of service ! Ah ! here's Peter Swyk.</p>
    <pb n="4"/>
    <stage> Enter Peter, R.</stage>
    <p>Well, Peter.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Good morning, Master Steward.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> So, you've been to Amsterdam, to buy cattle, I hear?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Ay, and fine beasts they are too, Master Steward: but, talking of beasts, how do you find
     yourself to-day ? You were rather poorly when I left.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, I'm better, thank you; but I'm not so young as I was thirty years ago—I find that,
     Peter. Ah ! I envy you, you rogue ! Three-and-twenty—stout-timbered— light-hearted—and rich, I
     may say; for old Jan Spyk, your father, left you a pretty round sum, I take it ?' </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Why, it might have been less, and yet worth having, Master Steward.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Well, and why don't you get a wife now ? All the girls in the neighbourhood are pulling caps
     for you !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Why, I don't know; they do look at me, somehow, but I'm not smitten with anybody in
     particular. However, I don't wish to prevent them—they may fall in love with me, then I can
     choose, you know.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Well, perhaps that's the best way.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Yes, I think so ; as Gertrude said to me, the other day, you don't love anybody in
     particular, Peter, so you can look about you.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Gertrude—what, our Gertrude ? The simpleton that has the run of the house and gardens, by
     permission of the baron, because she is the orphan daughter of his old bailiff, and who is
     always so mighty busy, doing nothing at all, by way of earning the living allowed her! Is she
     your counsellor ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, she and I gossip now and then, when we meet. She's a sort of relation of mine—my
     brother-inlaw's aunt stood godmother to her.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Well, that is a sort of relation, certainly.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> And then, you see, simpleton as she is, she has now and then an idea, and that's the only
     thing I want—I never have an idea. It's very odd, but I never have what you can really call an
     idea—of my own, that is—for I'm quick enough if a person only just—and yesterday, now, I saw
     her but for two or three minutes, and I'll be hanged
     <pb n="5"/>if she didn't give me a capital idea! and that's what has brought me here this
     morning. You've a captain Amersfort staying here, haven't you ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, yes ; one of our young lady's score of lovers and the best of 'em, too, to my mind; but
     she's too capricious to make up hers. He's a fine fellow—handsome, clever, gallant—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> And landlord of the fine farm of Appledoorn— so Gertrude says.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Ah! and you want to be his tenant, no doubt ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Why Gertrude thinks—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Well, she's right there—it's a pretty property; but there are several farmers offering.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> So she tells me ; but she says that if you were to speak to the captain in my favour—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Well, she's right there, too. If I were to speak—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> And will you ?—will you, Master Steward ? I've a keg at home of the finest flavour, which I
     should be too happy—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Pshaw ! pshaw ! you know if I do anything it's never with a view to benefit myself, Peter;
     so send me the keg, if it will serve you, and we'll see what can be done about it.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Gertrude, </speaker>
    <p><stage>(without)</stage> Mynheer Swyzel! Mynheer Swyzel!</p>

    <p> Here comes Gertrude.</p>
    <stage> Enter Gertrude, running, R.</stage>

    <p> Mynheer Swyzel! Mynheer Swyzel!</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Well, don't bawl so—you young baggage! What do you want!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>( out of breath)</stage> You're to go directly—I've been looking for you everywhere,
     to tell you—there's Peter Spyk!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> To tell me that ?—why I know that ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> No; to tell you—to tell you—how d'ye do, Peter? Are you very well?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Ay, ay!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Will you tell me what you mean to tell me ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Law! I'd almost forgotten—I'd run so fast. How well Peter looks this morning, don't he ?</p>
    <pb n="6"/>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Do let Peter alone ! and tell me who wants me— and what for. Is it the wine for breakfast
     ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Yes, that's it; you've got the keys of the cellar, and the baron wants some of the best
     Moselle, to give to Captain Amersfort.</p>

     <l> Well, but make more haste about it,</l>
     <l>Master wants to treat his guest.</l>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
     <l> Oh, I'll please him! never doubt it;</l>
     <l>Of his wine you know the best.</l>
     <l>He shall own that down his throttle,</l>
     <l>Such has seldom found its way.</l>
    </sp>

   <stage> Exit SWYZEL, R. </stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(aside)</stage> An old rogue, I'm sure he is; and he always snubs me and scolds me.
     So does everybody, indeed, except Peter. Peter never snubs me, at any rate; but that's because
     he hardly ever speaks to me. Now only look at him at this moment! there he stands, puffing away
     with his pipe, and turning up the whites of his eyes, Now, what can he be thinking about ?—that
     is if he is thinking. Suppose it's about—<stage>( aloud, and taking hold of his arm)</stage>
     —Peter!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Eh !—Oh! you're here still, are you ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(aside)</stage> How civil! <stage>(aloud)</stage> Yes, I am here still; and, if I had
     kept still, you'd never have known it seemingly. What are you thinking about so deeply ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Thinking about ? Why, I was thinking about Mother Wynk's tavern, where I breakfasted this
     morning.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> What an interesting subject!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Rather. The old vrow worried my life out with "Why don't you get married, farmer Spyk?"—"Why
     do you live alone in that old house, like an owl in an ivybush ?—"Why don't you take a wife ?
     You've got money enough to keep one, and you are your own master : you've only to please
     yourself."</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Well, and haven't I told you so over and over again ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Well, so you have; and I do think if I should get the Appeldoorn Farm, I'll sign a lease and
     a contract the same day.</p>
    <pb n="7"/>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> But, if you don't get the farm, what does it signify ?—you might marry all the same for
     that. You've enough without. You needn't wait—that is, if you like anybody well enough to marry
     them.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Ah, but then I don't know that I do. Now, who is there, in your opinion, that would suit
     me.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, don't know. I dare say, if I were to choose, I could name somebody.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Well, but let's see now. To begin with the neighbourhood:—I know all the girls here, and I
     am sure I can't say— <stage>(suddenly)</stage> —What d'ye think of Mary Moerdyke, to begin
     with?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Very bad, to begin with, and much better to have done with as soon as possible. She is the
     worst tempered girl in all Utrecht, and as tall as the tower yonder—a great, gawky, sulky
     thing, just like it.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Ah, well, I don't think she would suit me.— But there's her cousin, Judith—she's very
     good-natured!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Ah, Judith's a pretty girl, if you please, and very good-natured, as you say,—perhaps a
     little too good- natured.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> No, really—humph !—I shouldn't like that. What d'ye say to Anne Stein ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Everybody says she's a great coquette. See her on a Sunday, that's all! or at a dance at the
     fair! She's always changing her partner.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, if she's always changing her partner—well, they can't say that of little Barbara ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> No, because she is lame, and can't dance at all.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> That's very true ; poor thing, she's lame, so she is. Well, I declare, then, Vrow Wynk
     herself?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Old enough to be your grandmother.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> And Rachel, her daughter ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> She's engaged to young Maurice.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> The devil! Then I must go farther a field, for there's nobody else that I know of in this
     place.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Oh dear! oh dear! how blind he is, to be sure.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Ah!—stop ! What a fool I am never to have remembered—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Well, who?—what?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Why, that to-morrow will be market-day here,
     <pb n="8"/> and that there'll be plenty of pretty girls, from all the villages round about—so I
     can choose, without the trouble of a journey.</p>

    <p>The best, they say, are given away,</p>
    <p> Nor left to sell on market-day.</p>
    <p>In verity, verity, &amp;c.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Well, at any rate, I'll take my chance of tomorrow. But yonder's mamzelle and some of the
     gentlefolks, so I'll go and hear what the steward has done for me. Good-bye, Gertrude. I say,
     mind, if you can find me a nice little good-tempered wife, I'll make you a present the day I'm
     married, and you shall dance at the wedding.</p>
    <stage> Exit Peter, R, singing "In verity, verity,"&amp;c.</stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Now isn't it provoking? He can think of everybody but me ; and unless I were to say to him,
     plump, "Peter, will you marry me? "—and then, if he should say, "No !"oh, I should die with
     shame and disappointment. O dear! O dear! how vexatious it is ! And it's not only Peter, but
     nobody seems to think me worth marrying at all—nobody ever says a civil thing to me of any sort
     ! I never had a sweetheart in my life, and I do believe that's the reason. If I only had one to
     begin with, I shouldn't wonder if they swarmed afterwards.</p>

     <l>But I not a sweetheart can get for my life!</l>
     <l>It isn't because I'm not worth a penny,</l>

    <p> Dear me !—you don't say so ?</p>

    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> He wouldn't hear a word; and, to make matters worse, old widow Stein, who saw me talking to
     him, waited to hear the upshot; and, when I told her, she as good as gave me to understand that
     I wasn't match enough for her daughter, and that Anne herself liked Groot, the miller, much
     better than she did me ! A coquette !—you said
     <pb n="17"/>she was a coquette !—and you were quite right. I don't know how it is, but you're
     always right!—you've got more sense than all of 'em put together; and, for the matter of looks,
     why there's the captain vows—and, talking of vowing, what was old Swyzel about on his knees? I
     do believe he was vowing, too !</p>

    <p> A note for me ?—who is it from ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Del.</speaker>
    <p> The clerk at Van Nickem's, the lawyer. I took a letter there for the captain, and, as his
     master wasn't at home, the clerk opened it, and wrote this answer to the captain, and then
     scribbled that for you, and begged me to give you yours first—and so I have ; and now I must
     find the captain. <stage>Exit Delve, R.</stage></p>

   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Van Nickem's clerk, Delve told you.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Yes; here's his ugly name, sure enough, at the bottom of it—-Simon Sneek !</p>

    <p> Ah! if I recollect, he's rather a good-looking young man!</p>

    <p> Surely he's better than old Swyzel!</p>
   </sp>

    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Well! but what does it all mean ? Everybody wants to marry you.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> I can't help that—can I ? But I shan't be in a hurry; I shall do as you do—look about me ;
     perhaps somebody may offer that I should like better. <stage>(clock strikes)</stage> Hark!
     that's two o'clock!—and I promised to meet the captain at the sun-dial yonder. Good bye, Peter;
     and mind, if you can find me a husband that I should like better than any of these, I'll make
     you a present the day I'm married, and you shall dance at the wedding!</p>

    <p> <stage>(stands staring after her, with the note open in his hand)</stage> Well, when she
     talks of Anne Stein always changing her partner—she's off to meet the captain now ; and yet she
     says to me, "if you can find me a husband I should like better !"—the idea of Gertrude having a
     husband !—a little girl, that was only a baby the other day, as it seems to me. I wonder if
     she'd like me better; because if she would—I want a wife myself—and I don't know why I didn't
     at first. But there goes that cursed captain, running like mad to meet her!—'Gad ! I begin to
     feel that I don't like it all! Why can't he keep to his fine ladies, and let the others alone ?
     I don't go and make love to Mamzelle Ernestine, do I ? What business has he to talk a pack of
     stuff to Gertrude, and turn the poor girl's head? He'd better mind what lie's about, though—I
     can tell him that ! If he makes her unhappy, I wouldn't be in his shoes for something, for I
     should break every bone in my own skin !</p>

    <p> This note!—no. This is the note you brought from Van Nickem's. There's that young rogue,
     Sneek, wants to marry Gertrude.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Del.</speaker>
    <p> To marry Gertrude! Well, now, do you know, I think he might do worse.</p>

    <p> The best humoured soul in the world !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Del.</speaker>
    <p> Do you know, Master Peter, if I thought there was any chance of our living comfortably
     together, I shouldn't mind making up to Gertrude myself.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> You !—you be hanged!</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Del.</speaker>
    <p> Hanged !—what for, I should like to know ? I question now if I couldn't afford to marry as

   </sp>
   <sp>

    <p> Well, you needn't trouble your head about it, because you shan't have her !</p>

   <sp>

    <p> Why, farmer Spyk, what have you to do with it?—suppose I choose, and she chooses, you're

    <p> I'm waiting to know what she'll say to mine—but she's a plaguy long time with the captain.

    <p> Well, he won't be broke for disobedience, then— that's all I can say—for he does make love
     to her most furiously ! I caught him myself with his arm round her waist, this morning, and I

    <p> Indeed, sir; and for what purpose? I thought I had desired you to pay your attentions in
     another quarter for the present.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Amer.</speaker>
    <p> It is in perfect accordance with that desire that I have sought this interview. I am anxious

    <p> What do you mean, sir?</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Amer.</speaker>
    <p> I mean, Mamzelle Rosendaal, that the heart you treated with so much indifference has been
     accepted by one of the most lovely and amiable of your sex; and that, in the affection of
     Gertrude, it has found a balm for all the wounds you had so wantonly inflicted on it!</p>

    <p> Upon my word, sir !—and you have the assurance to make this confession to me ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Amer.</speaker>
    <p> Why not, Mademoiselle ? We are not masters of our affections, and, therefore, I will not
     reproach you. But can you be surprised that I should be weary of loving one who did not love
     me? or that, stung to the quick by your contempt, I should be more sensible to the kindness and
     sympathy of another? Gertrude is lovely !</p>

    <p> It is—it is a very beautiful dress, as you say, and I don't wonder you start to see me in
     such a dress ; but, as the bride of a captain, you know——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> It is true, then, you are going—going to marry Captain Amersfort ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Ah ! he has told you, then ? Well, I was in hopes of giving you an agreeable surprise !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> An agreeable surprise !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Why, are you not delighted, Peter, at my good fortune ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Delighted!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Only think—a poor orphan girl like me, whom nobody loved, and nobody cared about—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> It isn't true! I cared about you—I loved you— doated on you!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> You, Peter !—you ! Mercy on me ! And why didn't you tell me so then ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Because I didn't know it myself then; but I do now, Gertrude—I do now !</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Now !—now that it is too late!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> But is it—is it too late ? You are not married yet,?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> No ; but I have promised! The contract is
     <pb n="24"/> ordered, and this beautiful dress was bought by the captain on purpose. You would
     not have me behave so shamefully to one who loves me so dearly ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> But I—I love you dearly !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Ah! if you had but said so an hour ago! But you thought of everybody but me !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> I know it—I know it! But then nobody thought of you, and now everybody does ; and it proves
     to me that you—you are the only girl in the world that I ought to marry; and if you wont have
     me, I—I know what I'll do.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Dear me, Peter, what ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> I'll fling myself into the canal!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Nonsense!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> You see if I don't, then. I'm not desperate till I take anything in my head ; but then
     nothing can turn me!</p>

    <p> I'm very sorry, mamzelle. I know you only

    <p> Cease your impertinence ! Your simplicity is all affected !</p>

    <speaker>Ern.</speaker>
    <p> You will? Hark ye, Gertrude! Don't think that I care the least about Captain Amersfort—his
     behaviour has entirely destroyed any little affection I might have had for him ; but, only to
     vex him in my turn, if you will promise not to marry him—</p>

     believe it would be only the truth—I have a great respect for Captain Amersfort, but I
     certainly do not love him—and perhaps I do love somebody else! <stage>(looking at

    <p> To be sure I have !</p>

    <p> Well, as you say, when you once do take a thing in your head, nothing can turn you, I
     suppose it's useless to say "No."There is my hand, dear Peter !</p>
