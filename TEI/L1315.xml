                        Visitor in hot haste, who gets a cool reception. Anxious enquiries for
                        Louis, and extraordinary revelations concerning the wonderful sympathy
                        between the Twin-born interrupted by the cancelling of an old Vendetta, to
                        the mutual satisfaction of Colonna and Orlando. How one gives his bird, and
                        the other his word, and how Fabian receives a mysterious intimation that his
                        Brother has come to grief and has received a <hi>Fontain-blow</hi> on his eye, and
                        how he determines in a <hi>second</hi> to set <hi>fourth</hi>, and how he frightens his
                        mother and starts himself. </item>

                        By a distracted troupe of attractive Artists. How the Ladies shew their
                        partiality for <hi>Real Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Champagne</hi>, and how Louis proves himsclf
                        an anomaly, for though the least drop upsets him, he can <hi>stand</hi> any
                        quantity of Wine. Champagne <hi>cup-lets</hi> ... How Chateau Renaud wins his
                        Wager, and Emilie de Lesparre expresses a strong opinion of his conduct in a
                        <hi>cuss-ary</hi> manner, and how Louis takes up the affair and takes down de
                        Renaud, and how the Scene, notwithstanding the General Row, ends with
                        immense Harmony in the shape of an arranged Fight and a Concerted Piece. </item>
                    <item> SCENE IV.—CORRIDOR OF A PARIS HOTEL. How Madame dei Flunki with her
                        Retinue makes up her mind that the hostile meeting shall be interrupted, and
                        at “this juncture the Police shall arrive upon the Scene.” THE FAMILY BREAK

                        literally of the blackest nature, as does Fabian, who having travelled for
                        five days and nights is not quite awake to his danger, and how he puzzles de
                        Raynaud by a <hi>double a cross stick</hi>, and how the weapon fails through its
                        snap action, and how the Mother is struck by her Boy, but recovering from
                        the stroke of the Son is enabled to forgive everybody, whilst Fabian avenges
                        his Brother by presenting Emilie to Chateau Renaud, thereby securing his
                        Enemy’s discomfort for an unlimited period, and how he determines to write a
                        comprehensive account of the whole mystical business, and enclose it to

                    <l>Is more involved considerably, because you see with us,</l>

                        wuss.</l>
                    <l>We cut our tiny teeth together at the age of three;</l>

                    <l>We always made the same mistake when adding up our sums;</l>
                    <l>We both were nigh succumbing to a plethora of plums;</l>

                    <l>Which made it rather awkward when there warn't enough for two.</l>
                    <l>Our thoughts all run in couples, dual objects we behold,</l>
                    <l>We are so single-minded, but our boots are doublesoled ;</l>
                    <l>For fruit we both eat pairs, and thoughts of <hi>Dublin </hi> each
