     <stage>SCENE.—A handsome Apartment in Mr. Melville's House. Practicable doors, R. 2 E. and L. 2
      E.—in the centre stands a writing table, a violin and flute lie on it, on L., a couch.</stage>
     <stage>Melville discovered signing papers in a hurry.</stage>

      <speaker>Mel.</speaker>
      <p>There, there, and there; at last, then I have finished. Anyone to see me sign so rapidly,
       would look upon it as a sign of industry; but no, if industrious at all, it is industriously
       idle I am—for what little business I am obliged to do, I do thus rapidly, that I may have the
       more time to be idle—No, no, not idle, for he who devotes himself to the service of the
       ladies, need never complain of not having enough to do. Oh, here comes old Mathew, my head
       clerk.</p>

     <stage>Enter Mathew Multiply, R.</stage>
     <sp who="#L0480_M3">

      <p>I hope, to-day, sir, you will look over my last two years' accounts.</p>

      <p>Not to-day, Mathew, not to-day—to-morrow.</p>

      <speaker>Mathew.</speaker>
      <p>To-morrow, always to-morrow. Ah, sir! to-morrow's that scoundrel, who has never yet been
       born, who has deceived so many by his promissory notes, that I doubt whether he'll ever dare
       show his face in this world at all.</p>

      <p>Has Lord Charles called this morning?</p>

      <p>No, sir, not yet.</p>

     <sp who="#L0480_M1">
      <speaker>Mel.</speaker>
      <p>I wrote to him—why does he not come, I wonder? If I do not see him every morning, I never

     <sp who="#L0480_M3">
      <speaker>Mathew.</speaker>
      <p>Still young, you are one of the first merchants in London, and though it's only two years
       since you practised addition, and got married—</p>

      <p>True. <stage>(sighs.)</stage> I was married on the first of April.</p>

     <sp who="#L0480_M3">
      <speaker>Mathew.</speaker>
      <p>You were, and even now, as sure as madam goes one way, you as surely go the other. Nothing
       is as it used to be—except our amateur concerts, now and then; at which you blow the French
       horn so charmingly; if you no longer love your wife, one must confess you still love
       music.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M1">
      <speaker>Mel.</speaker>
      <p>Mathew, you are going a little too far.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M3">
      <speaker>Mathew.</speaker>
      <p>Pardon, sir, but the love I bear the son of my old master—who has pass'd his account, bless
       him!—makes me speak out. Look here, sir, at these diamonds, that you ordered me to purchase,
       and which, I fear, are not for my lady—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M1">
      <speaker>Mel.</speaker>
      <p>Fear nothing, and keep your lips closed about the diamonds.</p>
      <stage>(double knock, L. 1 E.—he puts them in a drawer.</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M3">
      <speaker>Mathew.</speaker>
      <p>Depend on me, sir; but do, pray do be more attentive to my mistress; for be sure that if
       the husband deceives the wife, the wife will very soon deceive the husband. Here comes the
       great cause of all our troubles, Lord Charles.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M1">
      <speaker>Mel.</speaker>
      <p>You are wrong, Mathew, he is the very best and most attached of all my friends. As you go
       down, tell William to let me know the moment the maker brings home the new pair of French
       horns I have ordered.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M3">
      <speaker>Mathew.</speaker>
      <p>I'll not forget, sir; no, I must cease my lecture and begone, for when deceitful folly
       enters, honest sobriety had better quit the field.</p>

      <p>Good morning, Melville. How fares it?</p>

     <sp who="#L0480_M1">
      <speaker>Mel.</speaker>
      <p><hi>Bon jour, mon cher ami!</hi> How is it you are out so early this morning? We did not

     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M2">
      <speaker>Lord C.</speaker>
      <p>I had some little purchases to make.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M1">
      <speaker>Mel.</speaker>
      <p>I wish to speak to you before I see my wife; I want your assistance.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M2">
      <speaker>Lord C.</speaker>
      <p>And you shall have it.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M1">
      <speaker>Mel.</speaker>
      <p>I'll do as much for you when you are married. Well, you must know, the lovely little French
       girl, that invincible beauty, with all her unconquerable virtue, has at last melted a
       little.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M2">
      <speaker>Lord C.</speaker>
      <p>I compliment your chymical power.</p>

      <speaker>Mel.</speaker>
      <p><stage>(in a low voice.)</stage> It is all settled—at three o'clock she is to be here; she
       will be charmed with my manners, and delighted with my conversation, I know she will. We sup
       together.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M2">
      <speaker>Lord C.</speaker>
      <p><stage>(drawing a note from his pocket, which he immediately returns.)</stage> Ah, that is
       what you mean then when you say “I sup with a lovely woman.”</p>

     <sp who="#L0480_M1">
      <speaker>Mel.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, and as I shall want a little money for my private business, and you have always been
       tempting me to sell my young Arabian horse, I am determined you shall purchase it.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M2">
      <speaker>Lord C.</speaker>
      <p>Willingly, and with thanks.</p>

      <p>But, ah! my dear friend, now comes the great service you must do me. It will be necessary
       that I should, at three o'clock, be here, <hi>alone</hi>—<stage>(sighs.)</stage> and you know
       I have a <hi>wife</hi></p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M2">

      <p>As how?</p>

     <sp who="#L0480_M1">
      <speaker>Mel.</speaker>
      <p>Presently, in a careless way, you must propose to me and my wife just to take an airing in
       the park.</p>

     <sp who="#L0480_M2">
      <speaker>Lord C.</speaker>
      <p>Well?</p>

     <sp who="#L0480_M1">
      <speaker>Mel.</speaker>
      <p>At the moment we are ready to depart, I remember an important affair—and men of business
       have plenty ready made— I am, therefore, <hi>against</hi> my <hi>will</hi>, obliged to remain
       at home. As the horses are put to the carriage, I could not think of preventing my dear wife
       enjoying herself; and you, yes, you must accompany her.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M2">
      <speaker>Lord C.</speaker>
      <p>But, Melville—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M1">
      <speaker>Mel.</speaker>
      <p>I know you must think a wife disagreeable, but out of friendship for me, do all you can to
       amuse her.</p>

      <p>You go this evening to the ball at Lady Graves, my wife's aunt?</p>

      <p>I am invited.</p>

     <sp who="#L0480_M1">
      <speaker>Mel.</speaker>
      <p>You know that for this year past I have not been on visiting terms with her ladyship?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M2">
      <speaker>Lord C.</speaker>
      <p>Which has astonished me greatly—a lady so amiable!</p>

     <sp who="#L0480_M1">
      <speaker>Mel.</speaker>
      <p>True, she is an excellent creature; but then I was always obliged to be there twice a week,
       a thing not to be borne, whereas by quarrelling with her, I don't prevent my wife attending
       her parties—indeed, I insist upon her never missing <hi>one</hi>—by which, instead of two
       nights a week of detestable tediousness, I enjoy two nights a week of delightful liberty.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M2">
      <speaker>Lord C.</speaker>
      <p>Well managed, indeed.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M1">
      <speaker>Mel.</speaker>
      <p>Is it not so? Now, my dear friend, you must take her to this ball and conduct her home
       again.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M2">
      <speaker>Lord C.</speaker>
      <p>Perhaps—I am engaged elsewhere—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M1">
      <speaker>Mel.</speaker>
      <p>It is to serve a friend, and by this means Julia will suspect nothing; for after all, I
       would not give her pain for worlds; and if I thought there was a chance of the affair ever
       coming to her knowledge, I would renounce it altogether.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0480_M2">

      <p>So plump, so pretty—not so pretty as my wife, I allow—but it is a whim of mine, a

     <sp who="#L0480_M2">

      <speaker>Mel.</speaker>
      <p>This is the last, I swear! But, after all, it does not hinder one loving one's wife—rather

      <speaker>Mel.</speaker>
      <p>I'll do the same for you with your countesses and your duchesses, for no less rank will

       admire the <hi>arms</hi> of <hi>your</hi> mistresses upon her carriage door, I admire mine
       with her arms about my neck; <hi>chaçun à son goût</hi>. But why have you been so mysterious
