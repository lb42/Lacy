<head>THE SCAPE-GOAT.</head>
<div type="scene">
<stage>Scene—Polyglot’s study. A door on each side, conducting to other
apartments. An opening to the garden, at the back of the stage. Another door
leading to the interior of the house. Globes, books, maps, &amp;c. are scattered
about.</stage>
<stage> Robin discovered, turning a globe. </stage>

<sp who="#L1468_M4">
<speaker>Robin.</speaker>
<p> ’Tis an extraordinary thing, that, do what I will, I can’t make myself
sensible. I turn the world topsy-turvy for hours together, as I see my young
master, Mr. Charles, do; like Mr. Ignatius Polyglot, his tutor, I sometimes look
into a book full of Greek or Latin; but all to no purpose. Ah! Mr. Polyglot must
be in the right: he can’t bear the sight of a woman in the house, for fear Mr.
Charles should fall in love, and neglect his studies; and, for my part, I’m sure
that, if all the Greek I have got in my pocket (<stage>shewing a book</stage>)
were cramm’d into my head, one thought of my sweet little Somersetshire lass,
Molly Maggs, would drive it out again.</p>
</sp>

<stage> Enter Molly Maggs, from the Garden. </stage>

<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> Hist! hist! Robin!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M4">
<speaker>Robin.</speaker>
<p> What! my dear Molly! You may come in.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> I’m afeard, Robin.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M4">
<speaker>Robin.</speaker>
<p> There’s nothing to be afraid of just now.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> Where’s Mr. Ignoramus, the tutorer, then?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M4">
<pb n="6"/>
<speaker>Robin.</speaker>
<p> Mr. Ignatius you mean. He’s out, taking his evening’s walk.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> Be he? I hope he be gone down towards the little bridge.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M4">
<speaker>Robin.</speaker>
<p> Why?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> The last time he went that way, he were so busy at what he called soldering
a problem, that he stumbled over into the brook. If I had been in your place,
Robin, before I pulled him out again I’d ha’ made him promise to consent to our
marriage, or I’d ha’ let him bide there till doomsday.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M4">
<speaker>Robin.</speaker>
<p> Molly, Molly, you don’t like Mr. Polyglot.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> Why don’t he like me then?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M4">
<speaker>Robin.</speaker>
<p> It is not you alone, but he would dislike any other young maiden about the
house the same.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> And what for? there’s no reason in that. Am I to blame? I’m sure ’tis no
fault of mine, Robin, that I’m a young maiden. Ha! ha! ha! A pretty to-do
there’d be if he should catch me here—in his own apartments too!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M4">
<speaker>Robin.</speaker>
<p> So there would. I tremble to think of it; and so, Molly, you’d better—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> I don’t care: if he says any thing to me, I’ll give him his own. Besides,
our master, old Master Eustace, will be home in a few days, and we’ll ask his
leave to be married, in spite of old tutorer.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M4">
<speaker>Robin.</speaker>
<p> No, no, we must not displease him; he’s steward as well as tutorer, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> He’ll discharge us? let him. I’m not afeard of wanting a service. I have
relations who are up in the world. I’m first cousin to Sally Maggs, who is head
chambermaid at the Bell, at Winchester—Chattering Sally, as they call her, and
well they may, for she is chatter, chatter, chatter—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M4">
<speaker>Robin.</speaker>
<p> In that respect, Molly, you don’t disgrace the relationship.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> Discharge us, indeed! the sooner the better; <pb n="7"/>we may then get
married when we please. What does the foolish old chap mean by not liking folks
to marry? I wish his father had been of the same mind, and then Mr. Ignoramus
would not have been here to torment us.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M4">
<speaker>Robin.</speaker>
<p> Well, well, though he is a little crabbed and sour, he’s a good old soul at
bottom. He’d go through fire and water to serve young Master Charles.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> With a vengeance! Poor young gentleman! he’s grown as melancholy as a willow
tree: and no wonder: at four-and-twenty to be kept in leading-strings like a
baby! But no good will come of it, see if there do; and I wish that Master
Charles would give him the slip one of these days, on purpose to plague him. O,
if I could but catch the old one doing any thing amiss—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M4">
<speaker>Robin.</speaker>
<p> Think kindlier of him, Molly; we’ll wait till we find him in a good humour,
and then perhaps—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> If we wait till then, Robin, you need be in no hurry to buy the wedding
ring. Well, I’ll go.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M4">
<speaker>Robin.</speaker>
<p> Do; for after all ’twould do no good to anger him. And, Lord! if he were to
see us here together!-Well, good bye, my dear Molly.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> Good bye, Robin! (<stage>loitering</stage>) Good bye, Robin!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M4">
<speaker>Robin.</speaker>
<p> (<stage>Kisses her</stage>) Bless your little heart!</p>
</sp>

<stage> Enter, from the garden, Ignatius Polyglot, with a book. Robin runs off. </stage>

<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> O, crimini!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> What do I behold! Under my nose! my very nose! here too! in my study, the
sanctuary of science and of learning!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> Well, if nothing worse was ever learnt here, Mr. Ignoramus—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> Ignatius.—But what atonement can you make for this?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<pb n="8"/>
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> Atonement! I’ve done nothing to atone for.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> Nothing! Do you call that nothing? Did I not see? Did I not hear? Nothing!
<stage>O tem</stage>—but you don’t understand Latin.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> Latin, indeed! no, nor Greek neither; and I’m sure ’tis all Greek you are
talking to me. What did you see? what did you hear? You heard Robin say good
bye, that was all.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> Peace! I’m a linguist, and in none of the seventeen languages I’m acquainted
with, does that mean good bye.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> Then I wouldn’t give seventeen figs to be as learned as you are, and your
seventeen languages are not worth talking.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> To what is the poor youth exposed! Mischief! Serpent! Woman! I pity, and
tremble for, the unfortunate lad.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> ’Tis a misfortune not likely to happen to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> But ’tis I alone who am to blame. I ought not to have allowed one of the
deluding sex to approach those innocent and unsuspecting youths. Had my pupil,
Charles, beheld this, it might have put things into his head, which—But there
will yet be time to save them. To-morrow, at day-break, you will quit this
house.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> Nay, and you wouldn’t be so cruel, Mr. Poll-parrot.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> Polyglot.—I have said it; reply not.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> I have not done any harm, and I’m sure I did not think any harm. ’Tis no
fault of mine if Robin is in love with me: he fell in love of his own accord,
indeed he did.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> Love! (<stage>looks fearfully about.</stage>) Silence!—If Charles should
hear that dangerous word—Retire—Withdraw—begone.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> (<stage>Bursting into tears.</stage>) O dearee me! Pray, good, kind Mr.
Ignoramus, forgive me this once. <pb n="9"/>Would you have it upon your
conscience to turn a poor lass out of her service, and send her upon the wide
world without a friend to protect her? Would’ee now, Mr. Ignoramus,
would’ee?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> Go away, my dear, and—No, I will not give way to the weakness of our common
nature, but prove myself, in the discharge of my duty, inflexible as the first
Brutus!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> And well you may call him so, if he was as stony-hearted as you are. Will
you forgive me?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> No!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> You won’t? Nay, then, I’ll tell you a bit of my mind; I’ll do that, an’ I
die for it. For all your grave looks, I’ll be sworn you are no better than your
neighbours; I know you arn’t. I’ll pass my days in watching you, I will; and if
ever I catch you saying “good bye,” as I know I shall, then, when you are in
trouble, and in need of indulgence, you shall find me as pityless as yourself.
There; carry that bundle upon your shoulders, and now—I’ll go and pack up
mine.</p>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> The little serpent! Her tears, her imploring looks, had well nigh—But I must
be firm: I see the danger, and must protect my pupil against the snares of these
pernicious creatures. Poor lad! he is innocent, and knows not the seductive
power of love. My example and instructions have so fortified his mind, so
hardened his heart against all silly, soft impressions, that, thanks to me, he
may hope to pass through life as becomes a philosopher—in a happy indifference
to all its joys, its pleasures, and its cares. He comes!—My dear disciple!</p>
</sp>

<stage> Enter Charles, in violent agitation. </stage>

<sp who="#L1468_M2">
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p> My dear sir, I’m glad you are returned.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> Your impatience pleases me. Come, is it to be Sophocles this evening?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M2">
<pb n="10"/>
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p> No:—it is not that, sir,—but—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> Well, well; we must sometimes relax,—make holiday; so, instead of Sophocles,
we’ll amuse ourselves with a problem in Euclid.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M2">
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p> Confound Euclid! as he has often confounded me. No, sir; I—in short, you see
me in the greatest distress.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> In distress! You alarm me! My dear boy, my dear child, what is the
matter?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M2">
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p> My father is returning; he is now galloping up the avenue, and I see no
refuge from my difficulties but in death.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> Mercy on me! what do you mean? No refuge but in—and in his father’s absence
too! Consider, that for all that concerns you, I am responsible. Wait, at least,
till he arrives, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M2">
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p> No, I am resolved; the matter is pressing, and there’s no time for
deliberation.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> And he has not half finished his studies! (<stage>Rushes into his
arms</stage>) Charles—my dear boy—be composed—look at me—who am I? have I not
been your guide, your protector, your friend, since the hour you were born. You
know I love you; that there is nothing on earth I would not do to see you happy;
tell me, then, what it is afflicts you.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M2">
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p> You will betray me to my father, and I dread his displeasure worse than
death.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> Betray you! Never; be it what it may.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M2">
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p> Swear!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> I never swear.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M2">
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p> Swear, or this instant will I—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> Hold! your danger inspires me with the devotion of an antique Roman: I
swear, (<stage>raising his hand</stage>) <stage>Per Jovem!</stage> By Jupiter! I
swear.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M2">
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p> Enough! I will trust you. (<stage>Aside</stage>) And yet I dare not tell him
the whole.—I—I am in love.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> O, horror! In love! ’Tis epidemic—’tis running <pb n="11"/>through the
house! Robin, Molly, and now—How, sir! and at your age, only just turned of
four-and-twenty; the thing is incredible, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M2">
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p> Do but hear me, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> In love! it cannot be: why, he has Greek, Latin, algebra, and mathematics at
his finger’s ends. And is this the termination of my hopes? You, whom I destined
for a philosopher; you, whose name I fondly hoped to see placed side by side
with the glorious names of Archimedes and Aristotle! Did love find out the
square of the hypothenuse? Did love—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M2">
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p> O, sir, if the bare avowal of my affection so displease you, what will you
say when I confess to you that—but here comes my father. (<stage>Aside.</stage>)
Where shall I conceal my dear Harriet?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> Be composed; he must not observe our agitation.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M2">
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p> Remember your promise, or I’ll keep mine. Pop!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> My dear boy I’ll not betray you, I—Oh!</p>
</sp>

<stage> Enter Old Eustace, followed by Robin, to whom he gives his great-coat,
hat and whip. </stage>

<sp who="#L1468_M1">
<speaker>Eustace.</speaker>
<p> Charles, my boy, I’m glad to see you. Mr. Polyglot, my worthy friend, your
hand. You did not expect to see me so soon.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> No, sir, we—we didn’t expect you till last week.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M1">
<speaker>Eustace.</speaker>
<p> Till next week, you mean. The truth is, I was willing to take you by
surprise, and see how things had been managed during my absence; but I might
have spared myself the trouble. You, Mr. Polyglot, have the superintendance of
my servants, and are accountable for their conduct;—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M4">

<p> Don’t tell about Molly and me, sir. (<stage>Aside to Polyglot.</stage>)</p>

<p> Yes—no—certainly.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M1">
<speaker>Eustace.</speaker>
<p> Well, Charles, my arrival must not interrupt your studies; retire to your
own room till supper is ready. Mr. Polyglot, I have something of importance to
communicate to you. Robin, desire the cook to be expeditious; my ride has given
me an appetite: and do you put lights into my study: after supper, I shall be
occupied there for an hour or two.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M2">
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p> (<stage>Stops Robin as he is going off.</stage>) What, sir! the pavilion at

<p> You are right to be severe with him: he is now arrived at an age when the

<speaker>Eustace.</speaker>
<p> No objection! Why, till now, you have always held that no man ought to marry
till he’s sixty; that is to say, till he has finished his education, and seen a

</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">

four-and-twenty.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Eustace.</speaker>
<p> Well, I’m glad it is so; for, to say the truth, although I am of your

thought sixty somewhat of the latest.</p>

<p> I’m delighted to find you are of my opinion. Next week I’ll take Charles to
town with me; he shall see the young lady; I do not mean to <pb n="14"/>control

instantly.</p>

<p> Come, Mr. Polyglot, follow me to the supper room; we’ll talk further of
this. I can never repay you, my good friend, for your care of my son. As I said
before, your example has made him what he is: for his virtues he is indebted to
you; and, were it possible he could be guilty of any crime or folly, so
completely is he under your guidance, that I should hold you more to blame than
him.<stage>[Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> What a fortunate turn has this affair taken! Since he is in love, he must
naturally be anxious to marry. Yet he did not tell me with whom he is in love. I
do not pretend to understand those matters; but I presume that, being in love,
he wants a wife, and—Oh! there can’t be a doubt of it; so long as he get a wife,
surely it can’t signify who. He comes; I’ll communicate the joyful tidings to
him.</p>

<p> I have been anxiously waiting the departure of my father.</p>

<p> I hope then it is the worst half, for really I have suffered—</p>

<sp who="#L1468_M2">
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>

<p> Come, come, courage; tell me all.</p>

</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">

<p> Eh? What!—say no more—Oh! Charles, Charles—</p>
</sp>

<p> Do but hear me to the end of my story.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> I have heard too much already. And are these the fruits of my instructions?
Is it by such wickedness you repay my anxious care of you?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M2">
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p> You mistake me, sir; if you would but listen—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">

<p> Never expect from me either pardon or indulgence. Had you indeed formed such

I might—</p>
</sp>

<p> What, sir! would you have sanctioned our marriage? Obtained for us my

<p> Betray me, and my life, my dear wife’s too, may become a sacrifice. But no,
you will not; for your own sake, you dare not. Upon you alone will fall the
blame.—Under whose especial care have I been placed? Yours. Whose duty was it to
watch over my conduct? Yours. Whose vigilance was at fault when I could contrive
a secret marriage? Yours. My father has made you responsible for my actions:
<stage>ergo</stage>: it is against you alone that my father will manifest his
displeasure at my misconduct.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> (<stage>His countenance gradually betraying his satisfaction.</stage>) The

a word to reply.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M2">

<p> But there is no time to be lost; you must at once decide. If you consent to
protect us, we shall for ever consider you our friend—our saviour. You shall
pass your days with us; we will be a comfort to your age; our children shall
thank you; and, as you moulded their father’s mind, so shall you give the bent
to their’s.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> My dear Charles, I will encounter anything for your sake: whatever may befal

your father. You must allow me a few days to consider the best mode of breaking
the affair to him. But where have you left your—it was only this morning I
rapped his knuckles for a false quantity—your wife?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M2">

<p> In my father’s study, in the garden. Taking advantage of his absence, I
have, for many days, concealed her there; but his sudden return compels me to
seek some other retreat for her. Aided by the growing darkness, I have removed

Not but that so imprudent a step as a clandestine marriage deserves the

used to—</p>

<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> The mischievous truant! I’ll trim him for this. I beg pardon; I forgot I was
speaking to you of a husband.—Ah! I can imagine by what arts he won your
affections. He has often delighted me. He solved some difficult problem in
Euclid for you, perhaps—talked Latin to you, eh? or Greek?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F6">
<speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
<p> Greek, sir! he merely said he loved me.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">

<p> Where could he have picked up that! I never taught it him. But I always said
the dear boy was blessed with a natural genius. And so you have taken advantage

<speaker>Eustace.</speaker>
<p> Do you hesitate?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M2">
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p> Will you but listen to me, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M1">
<speaker>Eustace.</speaker>
<p> No, I will listen to but one thing only. (<stage>To Poly.</stage>) When a
man has committed an error, is it not his first duty to do what he can to repair
it?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> Granted.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M1">
<speaker>Eustace.</speaker>
<p> To restore her respectability to the woman he has betrayed?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> Granted.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M1">
<speaker>Eustace.</speaker>
<p> To protect and bestow his name upon his child.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> Granted. (<stage>To Charles, who is about to interrupt him.</stage>) Further
concealment is impossible. (<stage>To Eustace.</stage>) But suppose his family
should refuse——</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M1">
<speaker>Eustace.</speaker>
<p> Refuse! In such a case, no honest member of it would refuse to sanction the
union; if he did, he would share in the guilt of the offender.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> I am quite of your opinion.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M1">
<speaker>Eustace.</speaker>
<p> Then why hesitate?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> The lady is already married; but if you would just have the kindness to
repeat to your son all you have said to me——</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M1">
<speaker>Eustace.</speaker>
<p> My son!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M2">
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p> Yes, sir; we throw ourselves at your feet, and implore your pardon. This
lady is my wife.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M1">
<speaker>Eustace.</speaker>
<p> How! married! without consulting me! Leave me, ungrateful boy!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M2">
<pb n="31"/>
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p> Will not the choice I have made procure your forgiveness, sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> Let me intercede for them. Remember the lecture you have just delivered to
me. Practice what you preach. Besides, you can’t unmarry them, you know.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M1">
<speaker>Eustace.</speaker>
<p> And when I had another scheme in view for him?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> It is all as it should be. You wished him to marry—what can it
signify?—there he is, without farther ado, ready married to your hands.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M4">
<speaker>Robin.</speaker>
<p> You save the trouble and expense of a wedding.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F6">
<speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
<p> You have a daughter who will love you.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> And a little grandson ready made, master.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M1">
<speaker>Eustace.</speaker>
<p> But the example——</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_F7">
<speaker>Molly.</speaker>
<p> ’Tis a good one, master; and, if you please, Robin and I will follow it.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M1">
<speaker>Eustace.</speaker>
<p> Well—well—since it is so: but there is a little urchin who, I foresee, will
one of these days play us a similar trick.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1468_M3">
<speaker>Poly.</speaker>
<p> Never fear: place him under my care—you know me; and I give him twenty
years’ notice, that if he too should attempt to elude my vigilance—Ah me! as I
have done for the father, so shall I doubtless be induced to do for the son; and
I trust to your indulgence for my re-appearance in the character
of—Scape-Goat.</p>
