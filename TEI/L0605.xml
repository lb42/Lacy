      <stage>SCENE—A Drawing Room fitted up for an evening party—to the left a card table—doors, C.
        and L.</stage>

      <stage>THWAITES, who has finished lighting candles in chandelier at back, C., steps back to
        survey the effect.</stage>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> Now, that’s what I call the real thing—the clean grit. The position of that bokey
            <foreign>(bouquet)</foreign> is such, that none but the purest taste could
          conceive,—those camellias, chastity itself. A fine combination! Cutting the turnips and
          carrots to make ornaments for the cold tongue; chusing the bokies at Covent Garden Market;
          mildly tempering the brilliant light of wax and gas with the soothing hue of flowers. I
          have brought all my arts to bear upon this sworry. The party who is a greengrocer in the
          morning, is the only perfect waiter in the evening.</p>
      </sp>

      <stage type="entrance">Enter AGATHA, C.</stage>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p>
          <stage>l.)</stage> So, Thwaites, the room appears quite ready?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p>
          <stage>r.)</stage> Yes, Miss Agatha; without exaggeration I may venture to say, we are lit
          up.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p> My father has not returned?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> No, Miss Agatha, he has not—since he left the house at two in the afternoon—I haven’t
          the slightest notion where he is gone.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p> Indeed! <stage>laughing—sits, l. c.)</stage></p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> No—though I did my best to ascertain;—“Are you going far, sir?” says I. He stares, and
          he makes me no answer. “Shall you be long, sir?” says I. He stares again, and again he
          makes no answer. “Because sir,” says I, “there’s the party this evening!” “I know that,
            <pb n="4"/>better than you do,” says he, “for I shall have to pay for it!”—just like
          him, Miss Agatha—ha, ha, ha!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p>
          <stage>aside—vexed)</stage> Really, ’pa must have a regular footman; these tradespeople
          whom he engages as occasional waiters don’t understand subordination a bit.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> I hope you admire the bokies, Miss Agatha; them camellias are quite the thing, I flatter
          myself;—all my taste—ha! ha! You’ll be called to-morrow the Lady of the Camellias!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p> Most offensive! <stage>rises, and turns aside)</stage></p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> Now, I thought I had said something very pretty—but she don’t look pleased.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p> No one has arrived, of course?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> On the contrary, Miss Agatha—I’m sorry to differ from you, but I rather think one has
          arrived, and is coffee-ing in the back parlor;—here he is, too!</p>

        <stage type="entrance">Enter WHITEWASH, C. from L. C., and down, C.</stage>

        <p>Mr. Whitewash, as I’m alive!—No occasion to announce you, sir.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p><stage>c.)</stage> Ah, my dear Miss De Windsor, excuse me if I stopped a minute to
          refresh myself with a demitasse of your choice Mocha instead of flying up stairs; but you
          see, a cause in which I was retained came on late, and I was obliged to exert myself a
          good deal—abnormally—if I may use the expression;—in short I was regularly knocked up.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p> Don’t think of apologies—as it is you are the first in the room. So you have had another
          brief to-day—I hope you have been victorious.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> One of my most brilliant triumphs! I actually outshone myself! <stage>Thwaites
            listens)</stage> A rascal had stolen a watch from a gentleman’s pocket, and hid it!—ha,
          ha, ha!—in his umbrella.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> Watch in an umbrella—come, that’s not bad!—ho, ho, ho!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> Eh? <stage>looks half offended—then continues without noticing Thwaites)</stage> There
          is not the slightest doubt that the scoundrel was guilty; indeed he had such a face that
          innocence would have been a positive fraud upon nature<pb n="5"/>—but, ha, ha, ha! I got
          him off—I got him off!—a weeping jury declared that he was not guilty.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p> Capital!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> Which it is capital!—just like you, sir.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p>
          <stage>draws Agatha aside)</stage> I say—this person—rather familiar.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p> Yes, I know—I’m quite annoyed. He’s our greengrocer. ’Pa jokes with him in the morning
          when he buys the vegetables, and now he’s come to wait in the evening, he don’t understand
          his position at all.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> I think I’ll take the liberty of dropping a hint. I say, Mr.——</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> Thwaites, at your service, sir. Cards ain’t common in our business; but my address
          is——</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> Of your address, Mr. Thwaites, I have not the slightest doubt. But I would speak a word
          with you.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> And I’ll listen if you talk for an hour. If I take up the newspaper, is it to read about
          politics? No! About plays?—No, I should rather think not! About pictures? bother, no! I
          look to see if Mr. Whitewash has been saying something for some poor devil in the Central
          Criminal Court. That’s my intellectual treat!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p>
          <stage>flattered)</stage> Indeed! ha! ha! Really, my dear Miss de Windsor we should do
          wrong to check this diffusion of intelligence among the masses.</p>
      </sp>

      <stage type="entrance">Enter DE WINDSOR, C. from L. C.</stage>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> He is here—is he—the dear boy. I must shake him by the hand. <stage>rushes forward,
            r. c. and grasps Thwaites by the hand)</stage> Eh! ha! ha! You’re not Whitewash!
          Ridiculous! I’m always making myself ridiculous; I’ve too much heart. You feel what I
          mean, Whitewash. <stage>shakes his hand violently)</stage> You feel what I mean.</p>

      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> I’m so glad you are here before the others. Leave the room, Thwaites. <stage>Thwaites
            lingers, moving at back to c.)</stage> I can now disburden my heart. As I said, I’m all
          heart. <stage>Thwaites advances, c.)</stage> Leave the room, Thwaites! <stage>Thwaites
            goes up, and moves chair from r. to c.)</stage> This moment is the most
          important—Zounds! Thwaites, will you leave the room?</p>

          <stage>coming to c.)</stage> Now look, I hesitate no longer; I shilly-shally no longer; I
          follow the dictates of my heart, and my heart tells me to—Come here, Whitewash—come here,
          Aggy. <stage>joins their hands)</stage> Whitewash, consider yourself as my son-in-law.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p> Really, this is very sudden, ’pa.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Of course it is; I’m always sudden, I’m a creature of impulse. But do you dislike the
          arrangement?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p> I did not say that, ’pa.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Didn’t say that, ’pa! Then why don’t you speak out? Wear your mind in your face, as I
          do, or as my young friend here, with whom I want to speak a few words in private. So, go
          and see how they are getting on with the coffee.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p>
          <stage>r.)</stage> And don’t forget, that you are engaged to me for the first set, and the

      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Of course, she won’t forget. Run along child.</p>

        <stage>Exit, AGATHA, C., off, L.</stage>

        <p>Now, I can give vent to my feelings; Whitewash, you’ve done it. I was long making up my
          mind, but now, you’ve done it. You are one of the men I like. <stage>shakes his hand
            violently—they sit)</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> My dear sir, I’m most happy. (wringing his hand)</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Of course you are. Look you, it’s only now that I like you; this very morning I weighed
          your merits with those of Tom Tango of the Stock Exchange, who you know has a sneaking
          kindness for my girl, and the balance was considerably in Tom’s favour. He’s a better
          looking fellow than you, and his conversation is more agreeable. Then, what’s a lawyer?
          said I, a creature all brains and no heart? no heart, sir! But now, I’m changed, my views
          are more enlarged—more expansive—I have been——</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> Dining out?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> No, I have been in the Central Criminal Court, during the cause, “The Queen
            <emph>v.</emph> Pawkins.”</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> Ah, I see! and you heard my speech for the defence. It was not bad, was it?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> It was noble—it was glorious. While I looked upon that poor man in the dock, and I heard
          you enunciate<pb n="7"/> his virtues and expatiate on the largeness of his small family,
          he assumed in my eyes the sanctity of a martyr.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> You don’t say so?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Perhaps you noticed that among the persons in the court one wept aloud—very loud?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> I did. The policeman turned him out, I believe.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> True—ahem! Some such brutal occurrence did take place; I was the man that wept, sir, you
          were the man that made me weep; you touched my heart, sir, you touched my heart.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> (aside) Really, a most sensible old gentleman!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Lingering at the door, I learned that the prisoner was acquitted. So I walked home, and
          I said to myself—Whitewash is my destined son-in-law. I as a manufacturer of fancy soap
          remove physical impurities from the skin; Whitewash effaces the blots that calumny has
          cast upon innocence.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> Innocence!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Of course; no one knows better than you that that poor persecuted being was innocence
          itself.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> (coolly) Oh, yes—yes.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> What delight you must have felt in restoring him to his weeping wife, and those five
          small children!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> Wife! children! Oh! ah! I believe I did use the expression.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> But there’s a further pleasure in store for you. You know I always follow the dictates
          of my heart. Well—well, my heart told me that society owed that poor persecuted being a
          reparation, and was bound to declare that he had not forfeited his social position. In a
          word, sir, I’ve invited him to my ball this evening.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> (rises) Here? To your house? A fellow with the taint of the dock fresh upon him!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> A taint that he did not merit—a taint that you have so nobly removed. (rises)</p>

          shilling slipped in one’s hand <pb n="9"/>would have given a finishing touch to the
          compliment; but one can’t have it all one’s own way; then her pretty smile were worth more

        <p> No; that’s where you put your foot in it. I ain’t a regular hair-dresser for a nobby

        <p> I calls it a shop, sir, but if you calls it a s’loon it’s werry kind on you, and I’m

        <p> Oh, perfectly unsophisticated! I only wish he had not fixed on the only head dress in
          the room that gives a notion of positive value? No, no, I must not hesitate any longer.
          Look here, my dear, sir, you are a man of heart—I may say, a noble creature—and it’s one
          of the specific weaknesses of noble creatures, to fancy everybody else as noble as
          themselves. Now, suppose this favourite of yours, this Pawkins, were really a little light
          fingered; suppose the dazzling brilliancy of one of your table spoons caused him to forget
          the distinction between <emph>meum</emph> and <emph>tuum</emph>. Under these painful

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Why, didn’t you stand up before the judge and jury, and bellow out your belief in that
          man’s immaculate virtue. Did you not clap your hand on your heart, and declare that our
          country might be proud of such a citizen; and St. Giles’s in the Fields proud of such a
          parishioner? Did not you cause me to blubber aloud, till I was turned ignominiously out of
          court, as a charity boy is kicked out by a beadle? And am I to understand that all that
          rhodomontade, followed by that expulsion, was for the sake of a pickpocket? Abominable!

      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Sir, no one has business to tell lies, professionally or not; a man should always speak
          what he thinks. I follow the dictates of my heart, and I always speak what I think; my
          heart is in my heart, and my heart is in my mouth.</p>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> Then I wish you would swallow it, and say no more about it.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Yes, I dare say you think that a very good joke, but what I am going to tell you is no
          joke. If Pawkins is a thief, you shan’t have my daughter, and Tango shall.</p>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> Monstrous!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Not at all, I give you my girl because I regard you as a noble defender of persecuted
          innocence; but if persecuted innocence turns out to be a low pilfering scoundrel, I
          naturally retract.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> But, my dear, sir, the doctrine you so strangely maintain is diametrically opposed to
          the very principles of British jurisprudence. It is one of the high privileges of our
          blessed country, and of several others, that even the vilest and meanest criminal is
          allowed a professional defender in the courts of justice.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Sir, it is one of the high privileges of our blessed country, and of several others,
          that a man need not give away his daughter where he don’t like.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> But, sir, by virtue of my profession I am positively bound to——</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Well, I don’t say you’re not. But an honest man, sir, should have nothing to do with
          clients that don’t come into court with clean hands.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> My dear Mr. De Windsor, borrow a little wisdom from your own business. If everybody had
          clean hands, what would become of the soap trade?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Go, go, and defend every pickpocket, forger, coiner, housebreaker, in London. I don’t
          want to hinder you, I only say that I won’t give my daughter to a man<pb n="13"/> who
          makes respectable people blubber till they are shoved out of court, on purpose to defeat
          the ends of justice.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> Then, sir, I suppose, because he furthers the ends of justice, you would give your
          daughter to the hangman.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> (puzzled) Ahem! I shall not condescend to answer an argument so obviously sophistical. I
          only repeat what I said before. If Pawkins is a thief you sha’n’t have my daughter.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> (aside) Reason is wasted on this old blockhead! I must try another tack. (aloud) Ah, you
          have passed nobly through the ordeal. Just to sound you I hinted at the remote possibility
          of Pawkins’ guilt, but he is in point of fact, as we both know, innocent as the babe
          unborn. Did not the jury say so? However, ta, ta! for the present, sir. (aside) I must
          look out, egad! I was only retained as the rascal’s counsel, but I find I am his bail.</p>

        <p> But, sir, I’m the husband——</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> (rises and goes to Pawkins) That’s awkward!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Pawkins.</speaker>
        <p> Yes; it is awkward!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> But we won’t flinch! Mr. De Windsor, I must say your society is not the most select.
          (pulls chair from under Pawkins)</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Fergus.</speaker>
        <p> (crossing to l., and collaring Pawkins) And now, you villain—you destwoyer of my
          domestic peace—what have you to say for yourself?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Pawkins.</speaker>
        <p> Why, I cannot say nuffing, while you goes on choking me like that! (Ferguson lets go)
          That’s better! Well, then, I didn’t have no thoughts about Mrs. Ferguson—Mrs. Ferguson
          don’t come up to my hideas of female beauty. (snaps his fingers) That for Mrs. Ferguson!
          If you will tear from me the secrets of my ’art, I com’d arter Jemima, Mrs. Ferguson’s
          young ’oman—there, now, ye knows all about it. I’ve told the truth, and I can
          shame—Ferguson!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> (comes forward, l.) So, Mr. Pawkins, it was Mrs. Ferguson’s Jemima, was it? Are you
          aware, sir, that I pay my attentions in that quarter? Are you aware that I’m Thwaites?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Pawkins.</speaker>
        <p> Are you, indeed?—who says you ain’t? There ain’t no advantage in being Thwaites, as I
          sees—I don’t want to be Thwaites. You’re one of them swells as takes out a young ’oman on
          a holiday, and grumbles at the expense all the blessed way there, and all the blessed way
          back;—you prefers the ha’penny boat to the penny, and you prefers walking to heither.
          Thwaites, you ain’t the favored man, so drop Miss Jemima;—I don’t say what I’ll do if you
          don’t—but just take an ’int, and drop Miss Jemima.</p>
      </sp>

      <stage>(AGATHA and DE WINDSOR come forward, R.)</stage>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p> (r.) Really, papa, this is an extremely vulgar scene, at our party.</p>
      </sp>

      <pb n="21"/>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> (r. c.) Disgustingly so, my dear—but join the guests, and make the best of it. (Agatha
          retires up)</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> (coming forward, c.) Well, father-in-law, I hope you are satisfied now!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Mr. Pawkins, I have an apology to make to you—you’ll think it very absurd—but I—I—ha,
          ha!—I scarcely know how to express it—but I actually took you for a thief!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Pawkins.</speaker>
        <p> (l. c.) You ain’t the first, else I shouldn’t have been tried at the Hold Bailey this
          morning. Look ye—a fellow chucks a watch into my umbrella——</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> (c.) Yes, yes, we know all about that; besides, you are completely cleared.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> (r.) Perfectly; your character is as cloudless as a fine day in July, and I am about to
          give you the most convincing proof of my confidence.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Pawkins.</speaker>
        <p> (aside) He’s going to ask me to shave him!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> (crossing to c.) I have long been looking out for a man of indubitable integrity, to act
          as my cashier; I keep nearly the whole of my fortune locked up in a strong box, so I may
          as well give you the key now. (about to give key, Whitewash hastily comes between
          them)</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> (c., intercepting) No! no! what are you about? A thief!—a common pickpocket!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> (r.) Ha, ha! victory!—you admit it, do you?</p>
      </sp>

      <stage>(retires to GUESTS, R.)</stage>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> (aside) Caught, by all that’s unlucky!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Pawkins.</speaker>
        <p> (l.) Come, I say, master, this ’ere won’t do: when I looks black, you makes me white;
          and when I’m whitened, you makes me black: I’ve a jolly good mind to——</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> Oh, go to the devil!</p>
      </sp>

      <stage type="entrance">Enter THWAITES, C. from L., with a letter.</stage>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> (to Whitewash) Please, sir, a knowin’ party, as calls himself your clerk, has brought
          this. (gives letter to Whitewash; Whitewash opens letter at first with indifference, but
          proceeds to read with eagerness; De Windsor, Agatha, and Ferguson come forward, r.)</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> (r. c.) My dear, this matter is settled; you shall be the wife of Mr. Tango.</p>
      </sp>

      <pb n="22"/>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p> (r.) La, papa! how shocking!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Fergus.</speaker>
        <p> (coming down r.) I beg your pardon; you don’t mean Tom Tango, of the Stock Exchange?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Yes, I do.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p> Then you haven’t heard the news: he was declared a defaulter this vewy afternoon.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> The devil! One swindles—another tells lies: where can I find an honest man?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> (rises, having been seated while reading letter) Here! (leading Pawkins forward) Look at
          that face—and read that letter? (gives it) The sum and substance of it is this: A
          notorious pickpocket has just been arrested, and retains me for the defence—confessing
          that he threw the watch into Pawkins’ umbrella.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Pawkins.</speaker>
        <p> Does he? Then there’s some good in the waggerbone after all.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Well,—as a barrister who twaddles, is better than a stock jobber who waddles—here’s my
          daughter. (joins the hands of Whitewash and Agatha)</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Pawkins.</speaker>
        <p> Ah! werry good! Jines hands and gives the paternal blessing! All right and proper! But
          wot good comes to me on it all? It strikes me you are a rum lot—you are. There’s this ’ere
          wenerable party—(De Windsor) asks me to ’is house—gives me a hice, which doesn’t agree
          with me, and does me out o’ three bob at cards! Here’s another chap (Ferguson) as talks as
          if he had gooseberries in his mouth, and tries to stop my windpipe. Then here’s a sort o’
          costermonger in disguise (Thwaites) as interferes with my young ’oman.—And
          here—(Whitewash) here’s the wust villain on ’em all. Ladies and gents, if I’m in any
          trouble touching your good-will—him’s the party you must pitch into—cos vy? Don’t you see?
          He’s retained for the defence.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> That won’t do! I haven’t had a refresher.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Pawkins.</speaker>
        <p> Haven’t you? Then take your refresher there—(pointing to Audience) that’s my refresher.
          Give me them ’ere parties on my side, and hang me if I’ll want any defence at all!</p>

        <p>In general, this transcription attempts to retain the punctuation and spelling of the
          source text. A few changes were made for the sake of consistency and to correct minor
          errors.</p>

        <p>The following changes were noted:</p>

        <list>
          <item>p. 2: Changed the name “Fergusson” in both the character list and the costume notes
            to “Ferguson” to be consistent with how the name is spelled elsewhere in the
            text.</item>

          <item>p. 5: White. (l. c.) Most acutely! wringing his hand)—Inserted an opening
            parenthesis before “<emph>wringing</emph>”.</item>

          <item>p. 11: (some of the Company <emph>pass across at back of</emph> c. <emph>doors,
              from</emph>, l. <emph>to</emph> r.)—Deleted the comma after
            “<emph>from</emph>”.</item>

          <item>p. 14: De W. (aside) Why, Mr. Pawkins, what’s the cause of this singular
            hurry?—Pawkins’ and Whitewash’s subsequent lines indicate that both hear De Windsor.
            Therefore, the direction indicating that this line is an aside was deleted.</item>

          <item>p. 17: Gov’nor can’t be coming the old soldier!—Changed “Gov’nor” to “Gov’ner” for
            consistency.</item>

          <item>p. 18: Tango will have my daughter. ha, ha, ha!—Changed the period after “daughter”
            to an em dash.</item>

          <item>p. 18: Mr. De Winter, allow me to remark—Changed “De Winter” to “De Windsor” for
            consistency.</item>

          <item>p. 19: They say we were found in a cupboard at three o’ clock in the
            morning.—Deleted the space before “clock” for consistency.</item>
        </list>

        <p>Note that Thwaites re-enters on p. 21 when he delivers a letter to Whitewash, but there
          is no stage direction for Thwaites to exit after Pawkins tells him to “drop Miss Jemima”
          on p. 20. He could exit either at the end of Pawkins’ speech or when De Windsor apologizes
          to Pawkins.</p>

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
