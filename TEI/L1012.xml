     <head>SCENE FIRST.—Boudoir of Adrienne. The room is neatly but handsomely furnished—folding
      door, C.—doors, R. and L. 3 E.; at the back, an inner room—sideboard, L., with clock, books,
      ornaments—clock strikes ten as curtain rises.</head>
     <stage>Giannetta speaks without.</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gian.</speaker>
      <stage>(without)</stage>
      <p>It is sufficient, Monsieur Samson, I can find my own way.</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter GIANNETTA, C., with a peasant's rough basket containing flowers.</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gian.</speaker>
      <p>Not a soul here! then I shall have time to arrange my little gift, so that it may find most
       favour in the eyes of my benefactress. <stage>(puts basket on stage, L. C.—sits down, and
        selecting the best flowers, arranges a bouquet during the ensuing dialogue)</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter BERTRAND, R. door—he has account books and papers.</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bert.</speaker>
      <p>I heard the rustle of a dress. I thought it was my mistress. <stage>(sees GIANNETTA—places
        books on R. table)</stage> Mademoiselle Giannetta.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gian.</speaker>
      <stage>(rising and curtseying)</stage>
      <p>Monsieur Bertrand. I presume mademoiselle is not up yet?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bert.</speaker>
      <p>Favour me by glancing at the clock.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gian.</speaker>
      <p>I look at the clock, Monsieur Bertrand; it is five minutes past ten.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bert.</speaker>
      <p>And yet you have the hardihood to surmise that mademoiselle has not risen. She has been
       abroad at least two hours.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gian.</speaker>
      <p>Pardon; I am but a model for the artists here in Rome; you are a mighty steward to a very
       rich lady.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bert.</speaker>
      <stage>(playfully touches her under the chin, as he passes to drawer of sideboard, L.)</stage>
      <p>I think, mademoiselle, I could forgive you even a graver fault.</p>
     </sp>
     <pb n="6"/>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gian.</speaker>
      <p>Ah, but you mustn't do that; you must cease to compliment. I am about to be married.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bert.</speaker>
      <stage>(selecting pens from drawer)</stage>
      <p>Bravo, bravissimo! Who is the happy swain?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gian.</speaker>
      <p>Happy! Well, we won't anticipate the future; but you know him. La! it's Hector Falloux, art
       student of Rome.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bert.</speaker>
      <stage>(returning to R. table)</stage>
      <p>Son of Hector Falloux, grocer, of Neuville. I congratulate you again.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gian.</speaker>
      <p>Well, yes, Hector's father is a grocer; but quite in a wholesale way—is he not?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bert.</speaker>
      <p>You had better enquire of mademoiselle: the minutest affairs of her estate in Neuville are
       sacred in her eyes—she will be here in exactly three minutes.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gian.</speaker>
      <p>You are confident, Monsieur Bertrand?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bert.</speaker>
      <p>I am; she gives a sitting to-day to M. Savignie.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gian.</speaker>
      <p>Then will Monsieur Savignie certainly fail her. I was at his studio yesterday, and he is
       away somewhere amongst the mountains.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bert.</speaker>
      <p>Then to-day besides, she audits the weekly expenses of her household. You will find I am a
       true prophet: observe! <stage>(Music—BERTRAND points to c. door—GIANNETTA rises, puts her
        basket aside—as the clock chimes the quarter, ADRIENNE is heard without, L. C.)</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adrien.</speaker>
      <stage>(without)</stage>
      <p>Monsieur Samson, you will oblige me by sending the soup instantly; the family I tell you
       are in want.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bert.</speaker>
      <p>You hear <stage>(pointing off and returning to his books)</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter ADRIENNE, C.—sees the bouquet which GIANNETTA presents her—throws off her scarf on
      chair, R. C.</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adrien.</speaker>
      <p>What a charming bouquet! <stage>(taking it)</stage> Really charming!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gian.</speaker>
      <stage>(assisting ADRIENNE with scarf)</stage>
      <p>I'm glad it pleases you—very glad.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adrien.</speaker>
      <p>And a double welcome for that rare flower <stage>(selecting one)</stage> that I have not
       seen since—since when—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gian.</speaker>
      <p>Ah! mademoiselle, your kindnesses are so frequent that it is no marvel you should allow one
       to escape your recollection. It was when you took a poor peasant, my mother, out in your
       carriage to inhale the pure air of the forest. My dead mother! <stage>(takes a small cross
        from her bosom, kisses it, and replaces it)</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adrien.</speaker>
      <p>Forgive me for reviving so painful a memory. <stage>(GIANNETTA retires, L. C.—BERTRAND has
        arranged account books at R. table)</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bert.</speaker>
      <p>(R.) Observe, mademoiselle, how dusty are her shoes.</p>
     </sp>

      <p>(R. C.) Bertrand?</p>
     </sp>
     <pb n="7"/>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bert.</speaker>
      <p>She has walked more than a league, through a hot sun, along a dusty road, to bring you
       those flowers.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adrien.</speaker>
      <p><stage>(taking GIANNETTA's hand)</stage> I am not ungrateful, my good Giannetta. Books,
       Monsieur Bertrand, if you please.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gian.</speaker>
      <p>Books! one would think mademoiselle was a poor clerk in a warehouse, instead of a rich
       lady; but I know she audits her accounts, that she may economise her own expenditure, and
       give a wider scope to her benevolence. <stage>(during the last speech BERTRAND has shewn his
        account, and ADRIENNE has compared the books, &amp;c.)</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adrien.</speaker>
      <p><stage>(aside to BERTRAND)</stage> So much for wine! <stage>(BERTRAND whispers to
        her)</stage> Your pardon, I had forgotten.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bert.</speaker>
      <p>We have no cellar in Rome, and if mademoiselle will be so generous <stage>(ADRIENNE returns
        books)</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Samson.</speaker>
      <stage>enters C. door, announcing</stage>
      <p> Monsieur Savignie!</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter SAVIGNIE, L. C., but remains in the doorway—he has a knapsack (artist's) on his
      back, and is dusty as having just returned from a journey.</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Savig.</speaker>
      <p>May I enter?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adrien.</speaker>
      <p>(R. table) You may, Monsieur Savignie. <stage>(to BERTRAND)</stage> This is right, I
       see.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Savig.</speaker>
      <p>Look at me; observe I am dusty—uncouth—travel-stained! May I still enter?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adrien.</speaker>
      <p>You may. A chair, good Giannetta. <stage>(she places one, L. C., and assists SAVIGNIE off
        with his knapsack, &amp;c.)</stage> I suppose I ought to express myself supremely flattered
       that you condescend to abandon the study of your dear mistress, Nature, for so mechanical a
       task as painting my portrait.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Savig.</speaker>
      <p>But when that task is a duty transformed into pleasure, why then—then—I declare I attempted
       a compliment, and I've positively broken down.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gian.</speaker>
      <p>Never mind, Monsieur Savignie; mam'selle will soon patch you up again.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adrien.</speaker>
      <p><stage>(shaking her bouquet at him playfully)</stage> I always said you were too
       ambitious.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Savig.</speaker>
      <p>Let me temper your severity by shewing you the results of my journey. <stage>(takes from
        his knapsack a small sketch book, places a chair L. C., with the back to Audience, and puts
        sketch thereon)</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gian.</speaker>
      <stage>(speaking while business is going on)</stage>
      <p>You have been away three days.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Savig.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, precisely, three free happy days: I often envy Salvator Rosa his life among the hills.

      <p>The date was Thursday, the 12th day of March—the place, the fête of the Solerno's. The

     <sp>
      <speaker>Savig.</speaker>
      <p><stage>(rising, and going to DE GRASSAC)</stage> It was in a crowded salon—I required an

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>De Gras.</speaker>
      <p>Have you finished?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Savig.</speaker>
      <p>Ladies were present, and I too was dumb. Before men, I too am a man. The explanation I
       requested then, I demand now.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>De Gras.</speaker>
      <p>The explanation?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Savig.</speaker>
      <p>Of the impulse—the base impulse, which prompts a man to degrade abroad the character of a
       lady, at whose house he is an honoured guest. Still silent.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>De Gras.</speaker>
      <p>Presently I may be more communicative.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Savig.</speaker>
      <p>Then it is for me to speak—for me to tell you, Monsieur de Grassac, that from your sneer
       and your silence a suspicion has been bred that the sneer and the silence are alike
       unworthy—that the suspicion they have created is a lie. <stage>(deliberately and firmly
        folding his arms)</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>De Gras.</speaker>
      <p><stage>(starts up—deliberately folding his arms)</stage> And what has stimulated the

      <speaker>Savig.</speaker>
      <p>When an innocent woman is cruelly maligned, every gentleman becomes her

      <p>Better than rich, Adrienne—she is good. Her purse ministers to no selfish pleasures. It

      <p>No, no comedy; no dramatic imitation of a passion, but the outpouring of a love for months

      <p>Be calm, Savignie, still; your words tear my very heart! Listen: as you are noble so will I
       be honest; could these lips hail you husband, then would the happiness of a life be condensed
       in the ecstacy of that instant. Between us, Savignie, there is a gulf which you will never
       see; but which divides us always, yet I would not have your words unsaid; in years to come,
       when my step shall falter and my eye be dim, their memory shall cling and cling till the
       cruel earth closes over me, and shuts it out for ever! <stage>(Music—during this speech

      <p>The truth. Courage, Adrienne! 'twas not your mother; 'twas this poor child! <stage>(taking

       lured to a <emph>mock</emph> marriage. Two officers of the army of Italy came to our peaceful home, their
       names, Emile de Martres and Eugene de Grassac; De Martres won my trusting sister's love, and
       a union, though in secret, was to consecrate her devotion. But few days past ere her husband,
       for she thought him such, left her, and after months of weary waiting, she heard that he was
       married to another; she, poor girl, journeyed to Paris— saw him, and showed him the
       certificate of her marriage; he crushed her heart with a smile and a sneer! 'twas a false
       <pb n="43"/> priest, 'twas his comrade, De Grassac. My dead Mina was the victim, and your
       mother, Adrienne, was the lawful wife of Emile de Martres!</p>
