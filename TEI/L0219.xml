<stage type="setting"> Scene.—Interior of the Lowther Arcade. The Strand
Entrance supposed to be at L. side; shops and stalls with goods exposed running
across at back of stage; Pedestrians, male and female children walking to and
fro at L., a number of people standing, others make their way in with umbrellas
up, which they put down and join the Promenaders; the Beadle of the arcade
occasionally seen; heavy rain heard. </stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(without, l.)</stage> Now, gentlemen, stand aside—don’t quite block up
the way if you please! <stage>(forces her way through crowd, l., followed by
Fanny; they have their parasols up, which they immediately put down)</stage>
Mercy on us! here’s a day! this is something like rain. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
<p><stage>(l.)</stage> Yes, mamma, very like it indeed. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Jellicoe.</speaker>
<p><stage>(r.)</stage> However, now we are safe under cover, my dear, suppose we
see what we’ve got to do to-day. First, there’s the upholsterer’s; then the
milliner’s; then the jeweller’s; then the printer’s—— </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
<p>The printer’s—what for? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> What for! why, to order the wedding cards to be sure! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
<p>Lor, mamma! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(imitating)</stage> Lor, mamma! just as if you’re not ready to jump out
of your wits for joy all the time! I’m sure when I was engaged to your papa, I
was so happy, I did nothing but cry all day long for weeks together: but,
perhaps I was more in love with the late lamented Jellicoe, than you are with
Mr. O’Walker? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
<p>I like Mr. O’Walker very well, mamma; he’s agreeable enough—very amusing—very
attentive—sufficiently good-looking—— </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> And very genteel! And then, he’s very well to do in the world; in short,
Fanny, it’s a very desirable match for you in every respect; and if we can only
persuade cousin Brown to be of the same opinion—— </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
<p>Surely, mamma, I can get married without the consent of this cousin Brown
that you are always talking about? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> Of course you can, my dear; but Barbican Brown is a rich old bachelor, and
your godfather into the bargain—I shall never forget him on the memorable
occasion of your christening—the tender yet half-reproachful tone in which he
said “don’t kick up such a row, you little brat,” as you lay squalling in his
arms;<pb n="4"/> and I must say, my dear, you did misbehave yourself in a
variety of ways. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
<p>Well, this godpapa of mine certainly must have taken a very violent interest
in me indeed, considering that he has never seen me since. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> Simply because your poor papa went out of business shortly after and settled
at Brentford, and cousin Barbican went into business and settled in London; we
really must go over to his little place at Holloway this evening, we shall be
sure to catch him at home, and then we’ll see if between us we can’t coax him to
come down with something handsome on your wedding day. <stage>(violent rain
heard)</stage> Dear, dear, I declare it rains harder than ever; I really think,
Fanny, we had better put off our shopping and our intended visit to cousin
Barbican till to-morrow, and get into a Brentford omnibus and go home at once.
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
<p>Very well, mamma, but do let us take one stroll up and down the Arcade first.
I suppose there’s no harm in it? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> Harm! Do you suppose I should be here if everything wasn’t perfectly
respectable? For goodness’ sake put that silly notion out of your head—and take
care of your pockets. </p>
</sp>

<stage> Mrs. Jellicoe and Fanny lounge out at R., looking at shops as they
exeunt; violent rain again heard and noise of voices L., in dispute. </stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Voice.</speaker>
<p><stage>(outside)</stage> Now then—where are you pushing? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(without)</stage> I’m pushing my way into the Arcade—at least, I am
trying to do it! </p>
</sp>

<stage type="entrance"> O’Walker, with a green cotton umbrella over his head,
forces his way through Crowd, L. </stage>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Isn’t it a remarkable fact, that people no sooner get under cover out of the
rain than they immediately congregate in a dense mass to prevent other people
getting under cover out of the rain—I don’t know why they should, but they do!
Here’s a day! never mind, I’ve no doubt the country wants rain, the turnips
especially: somehow or other, turnips always seem to want rain—I don’t know why
they should, but they do! and if they do, all I can say is, they’ve got
it—consequently, it’s all for the best; and although my new twelve-and-ninepenny
boots do feel for all the world like a couple of wet sponges, I think of the
agricultural interest and am silent. </p>
</sp>

<stage type="entrance"> The Beadle here approaches, and touching his hat to
O’Walker, points to his open umbrella, and then walks on. </stage>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(astonished)</stage> Now, that man evidently means something; he
wouldn’t touch his hat to me for nothing—I don’t know why he shouldn’t, but he
wouldn’t! </p>
</sp>

<stage type="entrance"> Beadle again approaches O’Walker, R., points to his open
umbrella, smiles, touches his hat, and about to retire. </stage>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(beckons to him)</stage> My good friend, perhaps I ought to<pb n="5"/>
know you? you may have been the cherished companion of my childhood, or the
friend of my bosom in after years? if so, I’m ashamed to say I’ve forgotten
you—now, what is it? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Beadle.</speaker>
<p>Umbrella, sir! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Well? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Beadle.</speaker>
<p>Don’t rain here, sir—under cover, sir—needn’t keep it up, sir! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(suddenly)</stage> Of course—ha! ha! ha! As you say, it doesn’t rain
here—I don’t know why it shouldn’t, but it doesn’t! I’m obliged to you.
<stage>(shutting up his umbrella)</stage> The fact is, I’ve so much to think of
I really haven’t time to think of anything. In the first place, I’m going to be
married—that’s a trifle to begin with, isn’t it? Are you married? <stage>(Beadle
nods)</stage> And how do you like it? Is matrimony an article you approve of in
the long run? In short—do you recommend it? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Beadle.</speaker>
<p><stage>(in a low tone and with a significant wink)</stage> Try it! </p>
</sp>

<stage> Exit, L. </stage>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>He says “try it!” therefore, he does recommend it! Not that I exactly liked
the tone in which he said “try it!” I mean to try it. I shouldn’t like to know
who wouldn’t with such a charming little wife as I’m going to have, a sweet
unsophisticated creature from the peaceful and picturesque village of Brentford,
with health on her cheek, innocence in her heart, and £2,000 in her pocket. Now
that £2,000, added to what I shall bring, will make a total of £2,000; for I
don’t mean to say a word about the ninety-seven pounds ten, left me last week by
my uncle Samuel—no, that ninety-seven ten I consider the property of my
creditors; I gave it yesterday morning to my friend Dibbs to invest in the three
per cents, with the full determination of paying my debts with the interest. I
made the calculation last night, and find that in thirty-seven years I shan’t
owe one shilling in the world: if that isn’t a moral satisfaction for a man, I
don’t know what is! Dear me! now I think of it, I went out in such a hurry this
morning that I hadn’t time to read my letters. <stage>(taking letters out of his
pocket and opening them)</stage> Oh, from Jacob Jones, Dibbs’ head clerk, to
tell me he’s invested my ninety-seven ten, I suppose! Holloa—what’s this?
<stage>(reads)</stage> “Sorry to say Dibbs is done up”— Dear me! how very
sudden—poor Dibbs. <stage>(reading again)</stage> “and means to make a bolt of
it to-morrow”— That’s to-day! well, I can’t blame Dibbs if he does; perhaps it’s
the best thing Dibbs can do. <stage>(reads)</stage> “with all the money he can
lay his hands on”— Of course, every man has a right to do what he likes with his
own, and so has Dibbs. <stage>(reads)</stage> “all the money he can lay his
hands on—yours included”— Mine! my ninety-seven ten! that scoundrel Dibbs!
<stage>(reading again hurriedly)</stage> “he means to be off by the rail”—
Jacob’s a clever fellow! <stage>(reads)</stage> “but I don’t know which”—
Jacob’s an ass! <stage>(reads)</stage> “but this I do know, that if you want to
get your money back”— Want my ninety-seven ten? Of course I do! “be at his house
in Arabella Row, Pimlico, before three o’clock and you’ll nab him.” Before three
o’clock— <stage>(hastily pulls<pb n="6"/> out watch)</stage> come, I’ve plenty
of time, that’s one comfort—I’ll jump into a cab at once, drive to— Stop—I’ve
only got a fourpenny-piece in my pocket, and I don’t suppose any cabman would
take me two miles and a half for that—I have it, I’ll jump into a Pimlirow
Omnibus—get down at the corner of Arabellaco, and come down upon Dibbs like a
thunderbolt. <stage>(looking out)</stage> Ah! yes—there’s an omnibus! here!
stop! conductor! </p>


<stage> Puts up his umbrella and forces his way through Crowd at L.—and then
heard outside. </stage>

<p> Here! Pimlico! stop! stop! </p>
</sp>
<stage type="entrance"> Re-enter Mrs. Jellicoe and Fanny from R. </stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> Rain or not, we must go now, my dear; indeed we must! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(outside)</stage> Now then, if you’ll allow me. </p>

<stage type="entrance"> Re-enters, with his umbrella up. </stage>

<p> Full, of course; and, strange to say, there wasn’t a lady would get outside
to accommodate me. They positively refused, every one of them—I don’t know why
they should, but they did! </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
<p><stage>(seeing him)</stage> Why, I do declare, mamma, there’s Mr. O’Walker!
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> So it is! How fortunate, to be sure! My dear Mr. O’Walker! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Mrs. Jellicoe! Miss Fanny, too! <stage>(passing his umbrella, which is still
open, from one hand to the other as he shakes hands with them)</stage> I was
that moment thinking of you—I was indeed, my dear Mrs. Pimlico—I mean Jellicoe.
<stage>(aside)</stage> That ruffian Dibbs! <stage>(aloud)</stage> And how’s my
Arabella—I mean my Fanny? <stage>(aside, and looking at his watch)</stage> A
quarter to two. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> Here’s a dreadful day, Mr. O’Walker; but it can’t be helped. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>No—I believe the only thing to be done is, what they do in Spain when it
rains. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> And what’s that? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Why, they let it rain!—I don’t know why they should, but they do! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> Ha, ha, ha!—you’re a funny creature! besides, as the old joke says, it suits
the ducks. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Not mine! <stage>(showing his splashed trousers)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Don’t laugh, Miss Fanny; ducks are no joke I can tell you, and so you’ll find
when the washing bills come in—after we are married; by-the-bye, suppose we wash
at home? I appeal to you, Mrs. Jellicoe—you’re a woman of experience in
household matters, you’ve been washed by other people, and you’ve washed
yourself—now which do you recommend? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> You’ll find washing at home a great nuisance. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Perhaps; but I’d put up with a great deal for two pair of ducks a-week. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> Suppose we get the home first? By-the-bye, we’ve just<pb n="7"/> seen such a
love of a loo table— <stage>(taking O’Walker’s arm)</stage> haven’t we, Fanny?
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Have you though? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
<p>Yes, John Horatio, and such a darling sideboard. <stage>(taking O’Walker’s
arm)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>You don’t say so; and I’ve got my eye on such a duck of a bedstead. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> Fie, Mr. O’Walker. </p>
</sp>

<stage type="entrance"> Here the Beadle again comes in, L., goes up to O’Walker,
points to his open umbrella, smiles, touches his hat, and retires. </stage>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(suddenly recollecting and shutting up his umbrella)</stage> Thank
you! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> Now, my dear Mr. O’Walker, let’s talk of business. Have you seen a house
that you think you would like? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Fifty! there isn’t a house in Grosvenor Square that I shouldn’t like
amazingly! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> Now let’s talk seriously, if you please. Of course, when a man marries, he
must expect to lay out a little money at starting. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>I perfectly agree with you, and what’s more, I don’t care how little. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> In short, as the late lamented Jellicoe would have said, you must come down
with the dibbs. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(suddenly)</stage> Dibbs! <stage>(pulling out his watch and looking at
it, then looking suddenly off at l.)</stage> There goes one!—here!—stop! stop!
</p>
</sp>

<stage> Puts up his umbrella and runs out, L.—noise of voices in dispute outside
as before. </stage>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(without)</stage> Stop! Conductor! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> Why what can be the matter with Mr. O’Walker? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
<p>How very odd! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(without)</stage> Will you allow me? Thank you! </p>
</sp>

<stage type="entrance"> Re-enters, L., with his umbrella up. </stage>

<p> Full again! the Conductor wanted me to get on the roof of his vehicle and
sit upon a sort of knife board—I don’t know why I shouldn’t, but I wouldn’t!
<stage>(to Mrs. J.)</stage> My dear Mrs. Jellicoe, I beg ten thousand
pardons—but I thought I saw a friend pass—a friend I haven’t seen since—since I
saw him last—but as you were very properly observing just now—by-the-bye, what
were you very properly observing just now? </p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> I was going to say that you ought to take a small house, furnish it
comfortably, and then, with Fanny’s little fortune and your own
income—by-the-way, I think you said your income was about—— </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Yes—more or less—but that’s the average. </p>
</sp>

<stage> Here Beadle comes in again, L., goes up to O’Walker, points to his
umbrella, touches his hat, and again retires; O’Walker hastily puts down his
umbrella. </stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(to Beadle)</stage> Worthy man, would you be so kind as to stop the first
Brentford omnibus? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Beadle.</speaker>
<p>Certainly, ma’am. </p>
</sp>

<stage> Goes out at L. </stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(l.)</stage> Oh, Mr. O’Walker, when you were a traveller to a wholesale
house in the oil and varnish line, and used to come down to Brentford once a
week for orders, little did I think you would ever be my son-in-law. And how
does the business get on, eh? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(c.)</stage> My dear Mrs. Jellicoe, you don’t imagine I’m the sort of
man to settle down in oil and varnish all my life? Bless you, I cut it a long
time ago. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> Indeed! And what are you doing now? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Why the fact is, I’ve tried my hand at a good many things: I thought it
prudent not to make too great a dash at starting, so I began by doing a trifle
in the coal and potatoe line—then I took an early breakfast house—then I started
a penny publication—— </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> A weekly one? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Yes, so weakly that it didn’t live above a fortnight. At last, I hit upon a
brilliant idea—what do you think it was? I turned doctor. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> A doctor? Then I suppose you walked the hospitals, as they call it? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Not all of ’em; I walked through Saint Thomas’s one day with a friend of
mine. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
<p><stage>(r.)</stage> Oh, then you’re not a member of the profession. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Oh no, my dear, I’m not one of your regular <emph>Materiars
Medicars</emph>—I’m what ignorant and prejudiced people call a quack; but I
don’t care what they call me as long as my boluses go down. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> Boluses! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Yes—O’Walker’s Beneficial Bolus! Sold in boxes at thirteen pence halfpenny,
two-and-threepence, four-and-sixpence, and nine shillings—this is a nine
shilling one. <stage>(pulling a very large pill box out of his pocket)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> Good gracious! And how did you come to think of it? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>By study, Mrs. Jellicoe—by intense study. I shut myself up in my room for
three months, and the result of that confinement was a bolus. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> And what do they cure? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Everything—if you only take plenty of ’em! I used to make ’em up myself at
starting, but so eagerly were they swallowed that now I’ve got three men and a
boy up to their elbows in boluses all day long. Now, I’ll explain my system:
these boluses are so composed that the more you take of ’em the worse you
get—still you persevere—and when you’re as ill as you can be you leave ’em off,
and from that moment you begin to get well; I don’t know why you should, but you
do—that’s my system! But enough of business—now for pleasure. When is the happy
day to be? Fanny, my fond one, my fair one, when will it be your happy lot to
call me yours? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
<p><stage>(r.)</stage> Ask mamma! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> Come and dine with us to-morrow, Mr. O’Walker, and<pb n="9"/> we will talk
about it. <stage>(suddenly and solemnly)</stage> I hope your moral character
will bear the strictest scrutiny, Mr. O’Walker. You say you have no debts? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(proudly)</stage> If you doubt my word, Mrs. Jellicoe, I refer you to
my milkman. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
<p><stage>(tenderly)</stage> And I’m the only woman you ever loved? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>The only one—except my mother. </p>
</sp>

<stage type="entrance"> Beadle appears, L. </stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Beadle.</speaker>
<p><stage>(l.)</stage> The Brentford ’bus, ladies! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> Come along, Fanny. We shall see you to-morrow, Mr. O’Walker. Now, Fanny.
</p>
</sp>

<stage> O’Walker opens his umbrella, and escorts the Ladies off, L. </stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Beadle.</speaker>
<p><stage>(picking up reticule which Mrs. Jellicoe has let fall)</stage> Holloa,
the old lady has dropped her <emph>ridicule</emph>, and there goes the ’bus!
</p>
</sp>

<stage type="entrance"> Re-enter O’Walker, L., with his umbrella up. </stage>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! it’s too bad—but I can’t help laughing. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Beadle.</speaker>
<p><stage>(as before—pointing to O’Walker’s umbrella, touching his hat, &amp;c.;
O’Walker puts umbrella down)</stage> Please, sir, one of the ladies dropt this
article—perhaps you’ll take care of it, sir? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(taking the reticule)</stage> Of course—here! <stage>(feels in his
pocket—then puts his hand into the reticule, takes out purse, and gives the
Beadle money)</stage> I always make a point of rewarding honesty—there’s half-a
crown for you! <stage>(puts purse in his pocket—Beadle touches his hat, and
retires)</stage> As I said before, I can’t help laughing; that poor innocent
little Fanny, too, flattering herself she’s the only woman I ever loved. If she
could only see a catalogue of my tender attachments, she’d find herself about
the hundred and sixteenth on the list—that dear Patty Peckover, for instance. I
do believe I should have married that Patty Peckover if she hadn’t had so many
cousins in the Life Guards; but she was a good-hearted soul—she never would have
treated me as Miss Amelia Jones has done. When I think of the number of cubas
I’ve smoked in that woman’s little back parlour, and the bill I owe that woman
for those cubas, that woman’s ingratitude quite shocks me! Here’s a letter she
wrote me yesterday. <stage>(taking out letter and reading)</stage> “Perfidious
monster”—that’s so like Amelia Jones, that is—“you’re going to be married, are
you? Don’t deny it, hideous wretch that you are;” that’s Amelia Jones all over,
that is—<stage>(reading)</stage>—“but I’ll be revenged: listen—I have kept your
letters, miscreant!” that’s a favourite expression of Amelia Jones’s, that
is—<stage>(reading)</stage>—“and to-morrow they shall be in the hands of your
intended. So tremble, viper! and believe me to remain as usual—your fond and
affectionate—Amelia.” Now any one would imagine that Amelia Jones was an
exceedingly ill-used young woman—but it’s no such thing. I went to her shop in
Little Windmill Street this evening, prepared to offer her a shilling a piece
for my letters, she wasn’t at home—so I went into her little back parlour, and
there, lying open upon the table, and staring me in the face, was<pb n="10"/>
this letter <stage>(showing letter)</stage>—beginning with “Loveliest of
Amelias,” and winding up with “Your fondest of Browns.” Now here’s a woman who’s
got a Brown—a mysterious Brown—a Brown who by his own account is the “fondest of
Browns,” and yet this woman presumes to call me a viper. Such is the sex—I
grieve to say, but such is the sex. <stage>(during the above he has been
occasionally cracking nuts, which he takes out of Mrs. Jellicoe’s reticule—very
suddenly)</stage> Goodness gracious, I forgot Dibbs! <stage>(pulling out his
watch)</stage> A quarter to two! Why it was a quarter to two the last time I
looked. <stage>(holding the watch to his ear)</stage> It’s stopped—that’s
pleasant; what’s to be done now? Ah, there goes an omnibus. Here! Stop!
Conductor—Pimlico—— </p>
</sp>

<stage> Puts up his umbrella, and runs out at L., nearly upsetting Mr. Barbican
Brown, who enters at the same time. </stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p><stage>(who is without an overcoat or umbrella, has a pair of nankeen
trowsers on, and is drenched with rain)</stage> I am not aware that I ever saw a
<emph>drownded</emph> rat, but I should say that the appearance of that animal
when in that state must closely resemble mine! It’s a singular fact, but this
morning I said to myself as I was dressing myself, “Barbican Brown,” said I,
“thirty years’ experience tells you that as sure as you put on nankeens, so sure
is it to rain;” nevertheless, nankeens I did put on—I sally out—before I get to
the end of the street down comes a shower—nankeens soaked! I go into a
pastrycook’s, call for a basin of soup, dry my nankeens at the fire, sally out
again, down comes another shower—nankeens soaked again; go into another
pastrycook’s, another basin of soup, another shower—nankeens soaked again! Look
at me now, I’ve just swallowed my thirteenth basin of soup, dried my nankeens
for the thirteenth time—I sally out, down comes the fourteenth shower, and, as
you see, nankeens soaked again! </p>
</sp>

<stage type="entrance"> Re-enter O’Walker hurriedly, his umbrella up—he is
closely followed by Schnipps, L. </stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Schnipps.</speaker>
<p><stage>(following O’Walker and trying to look into his face, who continually
thwarts him by concealing his face by means of his open umbrella)</stage> I’m
sure I know de shentleman. <stage>(in a strong German accent and trying to get a
peep at O’Walker, who again thwarts him with his umbrella)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(r., aside)</stage> My tailor—the devil! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Schnipps.</speaker>
<p><stage>(l.)</stage> You may hide your vace as much as you like, Mr.
O’Valker—I can swear to de umprella, ha, ha! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(putting down umbrella)</stage> Ah, Schnipps, my boy! how are you? And
how’s Mrs. Schnipps and the little Schnipps? I hope they’re all salubrious—I
don’t know why I should, but I do! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Schnipps.</speaker>
<p>They’re very boorly—de tree leetlest is very bad with de weasels. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Oh, they’re bad with the weazles, are they? I’ll tell you how to get rid of
the weazles—catch ’em asleep, ah, ah! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p><stage>(who is standing apart, l. c., and listening)</stage> Ha, ha! good,<pb
n="11"/> good, very good! <stage>(nodding approvingly at O’Walker, who bows in
return)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Schnipps.</speaker>
<p>De doctor says I must take dem in de country. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>The weazles? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Schnipps.</speaker>
<p>No—de leetle ones—to give dem a leetle fresh hair. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>A little fresh hair, eh? then I’d advise you to go with them.
<stage>(pointing to Schnipps’s bald head)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p><stage>(as before)</stage> Good, good, good again! <stage>(nods approvingly
to O’Walker, who again bows)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Schnipps.</speaker>
<p>And where’s de money to come from? Gustamers won’t pay—it’s no use at all
sending in their pills. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Then why don’t you try draughts? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p><stage>(as before)</stage> Good, good, good again! <stage>(same play)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Schnipps.</speaker>
<p>No—I will try de law! I will make dem pay, and yourself among de number—yes,
Mr. O’Valker. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Now there’s gratitude! Didn’t you ask me for my custom? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Schnipps.</speaker>
<p>Ya! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Did you ask me what my custom was? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Schnipps.</speaker>
<p>No. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Then you ought, and I should have told you my custom was not to pay—I don’t
know why I shouldn’t, but I don’t! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p><stage>(as before)</stage> Good, good, good again! <stage>(same play)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Schnipps.</speaker>
<p>We will see that, ha, ha! when you find yourself in brison—perhaps you will
laugh on de oder side of your vace—but I can’t stop here all day—I’ve got to go
after anoder bad gustomer at Bimligo. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(suddenly)</stage> Pimlico!—I quite forgot Dibbs! Ah!—<stage>(looking
out)</stage> there goes an omnibus! here! conductor! stop! stop! </p>
</sp>

<stage> Opening his umbrella and pushing his way out, L., followed by Schnipps,
shouting “Mr. O’Valker! Mr. O’Valker!” </stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>I feel an intense desire to cultivate that gentleman’s acquaintance; in
short, so intense is my desire to cultivate that gentleman’s acquaintance, that
I’ll instantly run after him! No—yes! I will, though I know what the result will
be, namely, another shower, and nankeens soaked again. <stage>(running towards
l., again meets O’Walker, who again nearly upsets him)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(l.)</stage> Full again! it’s a most extraordinary thing!
<stage>(twirling his umbrella round and sprinkling the wet over Brown, who tries
to advance towards him)</stage> I repeat It’s a most extraordinary thing!
<stage>(twirling umbrella and sprinkling Brown again, who is advancing on the
other side of him)</stage> It really seems as if the entire population of the
metropolis was animated by a frantic desire to go to Pimlico to-day! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p><stage>(r., to O’Walker)</stage> Sir, you have afforded me considerable
amusement, and I thank you—I’d embrace you, only I might give you cold, being,
as you see, wet through. </p>
</sp>

<p> O’Walker <stage>(l.)</stage> I see you are, those nankeens of yours are
the<pb n="12"/> most uncomfortable looking things I ever saw, however, rather
than disappoint you I’ll wait till you’re dry—I don’t know why I should—but I
will. </p>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p><stage>(r.)</stage> That tailor of yours, sir, hadn’t the ghost of a chance
with you—you didn’t leave him a leg to stand on. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>No, I flatter myself I rather cooked his goose. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>Good, good, good again: if you will insist upon making yourself so damned
agreeable, I shall be obliged to embrace you before I <emph>am</emph> dry. I am
the last man in the world to intrude upon any one, but if upon emerging into
yonder crowded thoroughfare, our paths happen to lay in the same direction, we
will walk together, and by the time we part, as I shall probably be dry, I can
embrace you. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(impatiently)</stage> Oh! confound it—there—<stage>(flinging his arms
round Brown)</stage> and now I’m off to Pimlico—what say you? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>I say wherever you go—Brown goes too. <stage>(taking O’Walker’s arm)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Brown! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>Brown! Barbican Brown! but perhaps you’ll have no objection to my taking
Little Windmill Street in my way? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(aside)</stage> Brown—Little Windmill Street! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>Just to buy a few cubas. <stage>(taking out cigar case)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(aside)</stage> Brown—Little Windmill Street—cubas. <stage>(snatches
cigar case out of Brown’s hand—takes out a cuba and examines it, aside)</stage>
This is one of Amelia Jones’s cubas—I’ll swear to it—he’s a Brown—he says he’s a
Brown, and if a Brown, why not the “fondest of Brown’s,” if I could only make
him the means of getting those infernal letters of mine back—I have it.
<stage>(aloud and suddenly seizing Brown’s hand)</stage> Brown, it is my painful
duty instantly to plunge a dagger into your manly bosom. <stage>(Brown
starts)</stage> Don’t be alarmed, I speak figuratively—in other words—<stage>(in
a loud and mysterious whisper)</stage> go elsewhere for your cubas. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>Ah! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(aside)</stage> It <emph>is</emph> the fondest of Brown’s.
<stage>(aloud in the same low earnest tone)</stage> Brown, you are deceived.
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>I mean that Amelia Jones—— </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>Hush! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>I repeat, that Amelia Jones. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>Hush! <stage>(looking about him and then to O’Walker)</stage> don’t speak so
loud—I’m afraid you’ll call me a sad dog when I unfold my tale—I shan’t be
offended if you do—for I know I’m a shocking good-for-nothing rascal, but I
can’t help it—that’s the melancholy part of it—I can’t help it. Listen! As I was
sauntering about the West End one evening last week, I suddenly found that I had
lost my way, and seeing a gentleman in a Highland dress standing outside the
door of a tobacconist’s shop, in the act of taking a pinch of snuff, I accosted
him and civilly asked him where I was; he didn’t think proper to reply, which I
inferred from being a Highlander he didn’t understand English—consequently, I
entered the shop, and there I beheld a sweet creature—I bought a cigar, and
though I had never smoked before in all my life, I lighted it—I positively<pb
n="13"/> lighted it, and then I smoked and chatted, and chatted and smoked,
till, as it was getting <emph>rather</emph> late, and <emph>I</emph> was getting
very poorly, I took my leave of the fair creature and went home. I’m ashamed to
say I was there again, the next day, and the next day, and the day after that;
and as every pound of cigars I bought of her seemed to ingratiate me more and
more in her good opinion, in less than a week I found I had laid in a sufficient
stock to open a tobacconist’s shop of my own—in fact I became so fascinated—so
charmed—so—so—— </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Spooney! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>Exactly—so spooney—that I was on the point of asking her to become Mrs.
Brown, when I suddenly recollected that I was engaged to another. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Engaged to another? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>Hush! A woman who can’t live without seeing me twice a day and that I haven’t
been near for a week. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Then go to her, Brown, and forget the perfidious Amelia. She’s made a fool of
you, Brown, nobody can look at you and doubt it. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>How? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Simply because she’s engaged to be married. I happen to know the fact,
because the gentleman is the friend of an intimate friend of a friend of mine, I
don’t know why he should be, but he is. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>Who is he? Tell me his odious name and place of abode, in order that I may
instantly repair thither and sweep him off the surface of the earth. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>I can’t tell you his odious name—but his letters <emph>can</emph>, and Amelia
Jones has got half a bushel of ’em at least—so go to her at once—ask for a few
pounds of her best havannahs—she’ll open a particular drawer—then you’ll see the
letters. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>How do you know? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Eh! Why—because the friend of my friend’s intimate friend told him so and he
told me; so as I said before there you’ll see the letters—you’ll pounce down
upon them, carry them off in triumph—join me here,—and then we’ll decide upon
future operations. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>That’s settled already—the friend of your friend’s intimate friend—dies—and
now I’m off. <stage>(starting towards l.)</stage> Stop—<stage>(feeling his
clothes)</stage> dry as a bone—so come to my arms. <stage>(embraces O’Walker and
runs off l.)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>There he goes, what an advantage a man of his protuberant proportions has in
a crowd to be sure! I shall count every minute till he comes back with the
letters. What a state of nervous agitation I’m in to be sure. Goodness gracious!
Dibbs! I quite forgot Dibbs. Ah, there’s an omnibus! here! conductor! stop!
<stage>(opening his umbrella and running towards l. and pushing against Patty
Peckover who enters with her parasol up and a pair of clogs in her hand)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Patty.</speaker>
<p><stage>(r.)</stage> Well, I’m sure, sir,—eh? Yes. I do declare it’s<pb n="14"
/> O’Walker. <stage>(laying hold of O’Walker by the tail of his coat and pulling
him back)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(l. without looking at her and endeavouring to make his way
out)</stage> I’ll speak to you presently, ma’am—here! conductor! stop!
<stage>(flourishing his umbrella)</stage> Gone, of course—and this is your
doing, ma’am? <stage>(turning upon Patty)</stage> Eh—no—yes—it is—Patty
Peckover, and more bewitching than ever. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Patty.</speaker>
<p>O’Walker! but no familiarity if you please, I’m a married woman. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Married! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Patty.</speaker>
<p>Yes! at least I’m as bad—I mean as good as married. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Oh—to one of your numerous cousins in the Life Guards I suppose? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Patty.</speaker>
<p>That’s no affair of yours, sir,—when you behaved like a brute to me—yes, Mr.
O’Walker, brute’s the word—you didn’t imagine I was going to remain in a state
of single blessedness all my life. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>And yet you swore you would. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Patty.</speaker>
<p>And so I did—for a whole fortnight, and then out of spite I vowed I’d marry
the first man that asked me—I shouldn’t have cared who, if he’d been a baron or
even a duke I’d have had him! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>And who is the happy man? What’s his name? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Patty.</speaker>
<p>B. B. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>B. B. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Patty.</speaker>
<p>Yes—I shan’t tell you any more, except that he’s made his fortune in the soap
line, and says I’m absolute perfection. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>The soft soap line evidently. Patty, I congratulate you on your B. B., and
you may as well congratulate me.—I’m going to be married. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Patty.</speaker>
<p>You! You who vowed you could never love any woman but me! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>No, more I did, <emph>for a whole fortnight?</emph>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Patty.</speaker>
<p>Well, I can’t stand chattering here any longer—I must go and look after my
intended. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>By all means; we’ll go and look after your intended. <stage>(opening his
umbrella and offering Patty his arm)</stage> Come along, Patty. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Patty.</speaker>
<p>Certainly not, Mr. O’Walker. B. B.’s so dreadfully jealous, he’d do you some
frightful injury to a certainty; that’s one reason—the second is—— </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Never mind the second, the first is perfectly satisfactory: though we may be
friends, we’re no longer sweethearts. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Patty.</speaker>
<p>Sweethearts, Mr. O’Walker! <stage>(drawing herself up)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Ah! those were happy days. Greenwich in the morning—— </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Patty.</speaker>
<p>Greenwich, Mr. O’Walker! <stage>(horrified)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Vauxhall in the evening—— </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Patty.</speaker>
<p>Vauxhall, Mr. O’Walker! <stage>(horrified)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>And then the polka—the delicious polka! <stage>(polking with his umbrella.
Band plays a polka l.)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Patty.</speaker>
<p>The polka, Mr. O’Walker, just as if <emph>I</emph> ever—— <stage>(looking<pb
n="15"/> at O’Walker dancing and beginning to move her feet about
suddenly)</stage> That’s all wrong—bless the man, you never could do it right.
<stage>(snatches umbrella from O’Walker and flings it away—dances the polka with
O’Walker, till seeing Beadle who appears l. she escapes from O’Walker and runs
off, r.)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(suddenly)</stage> Good gracious! Dibbs! I quite forgot that scoundrel
Dibbs. <stage>(snatches up his umbrella—opens it—starts off towards l. and runs
up against Brown who enters, l.)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p><stage>(advancing to the front and showing his clothes wet through)</stage>
Soaked again! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Well, the letters! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>I’ve got ’em; they cost me a pound of cigars, but that’s not worth thinking
about. <stage>(showing a packet of cigars)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Certainly not. <stage>(taking cigars)</stage> Don’t think of ’em again. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>I look upon that as money well laid out. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Decidedly well laid out! <stage>(putting the cigars into his blue
bag)</stage> Now for the letters. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p><stage>(producing letters tied up)</stage> Here they are. To my surprise she
gave them up without the slightest hesitation, and said she was very much
obliged to me for taking the rubbish away. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Rubbish! Ha, ha! <stage>(forcing a laugh)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>Yes; it seems she has been for some time past pestered with letters from a
contemptible fellow with the vulgar name of O’Walker. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! <stage>(aside)</stage> This is pleasant! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>Yes; he signs himself “John Horatio O’Walker,” and she requested me as a
particular favour to find Walker out at once, and give Walker a horsewhipping on
her account as well as my own. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Ah, ah, ah! <stage>(aside)</stage> This is remarkably agreeable. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>I said I would, and so I will. Take me to him. I’m sorry for your friend’s
intimate friend’s friend, but I’ve a duty to perform; and that duty, as I said
before, is instantly to sweep O’Walker off the surface of the earth! So come
along. </p>
</sp>

<stage type="entrance"> Enter Mrs. Jellicoe, L., with Beadle following. </stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(as she enters)</stage> I’m sure I must have dropped it here. It’s a
green reticule, with sixteen shillings and fourpence halfpenny in it, besides a
pair of spectacles, two bunches of keys, a packet of envelopes, two buns, a
silver thimble, six Queen’s heads, a bill of the play, and half a pint of nuts.
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Beadle.</speaker>
<p>All right, ma’am—I gave it to that gentleman. <stage>(points to
O’Walker)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> Ah! still here, Mr.—— </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(very quickly and interrupting her)</stage> Yes—yes. <stage>(aside to
her)</stage> Don’t mention my name—you see that portly individual there—
<stage>(pointing to Brown, who is standing with his back towards them)</stage>
Insane! sad case!—in early life fell in love with the Baron’s fair daughter,
you’ve heard of her—she deceived him and married Walker, the twopenny postman,
you’ve heard of him—it turned<pb n="16"/> his brain—quiet as a lamb till he
hears “Walker”—then raving mad in a moment!—the chances are, he’d murder me on
the spot, and you too—I don’t know why he should, but he would! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> Lud a mercy! <stage>(looking again at Brown)</stage> Eh? can it be? no—yes
it is— <stage>(to O’Walker)</stage> that gentleman’s no more mad than you
are—you’re mistaken in your man, and I’ll prove it. <stage>(goes to Brown and in
a loud voice)</stage> Walker! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p><stage>(jumping round with a savage yell)</stage> Ah! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(c.)</stage> Cousin Brown, don’t you know me? <stage>(alarmed)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p><stage>(r.)</stage> Cousin Jellicoe, delighted to see you! <stage>(advancing
to her, seizing her hands and shaking them violently)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(in a soothing tone)</stage> Don’t agitate yourself, Barbican. I wouldn’t
have touched upon such a delicate subject for the world—but I never heard a
syllable about the “Baron’s fair daughter—or the twopenny postman” either till I
was told of it just now by Mr.—— </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(interrupting her)</stage> Exactly. <stage>(aside to Brown, who looks
astonished)</stage> Don’t notice what she says, poor soul—insane! sad case!—last
Christmas went out without her bonnet—burning sun—snow on the ground—never
recovered it! <stage>(goes up)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p><stage>(pathetically and looking at Mrs. J.)</stage> Poor soul! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> And now, Cousin Brown, now that I’ve got you—<stage>(suddenly taking his
arm—Brown rather alarmed)</stage> we must talk over a certain little matter—in
other words, my darling Fanny is only waiting for her dear godpapa’s consent to
get married—isn’t she, Mr. O’Wal—— <stage>(to O’Walker)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(very quickly)</stage> Yes—yes. <stage>(aside)</stage> This is getting
intensely exciting! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>Well, my consent shan’t be wanting, nor a wedding portion either, provided I
approve of Fanny’s choice. What sort of a fellow is he—eh? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> Judge for yourself, Cousin Brown—for there he is. <stage>(pointing to
O’Walker)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>Eh!—I’m delighted to hear it!— <stage>(shaking O’Walker’s hand)</stage> but
where’s my god-daughter?—Brown requires his god-daughter! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> There she is! <stage>(to Fanny, who runs in l.)</stage> Fanny, embrace your
godpapa—he consents to your marriage. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
<p>Oh, you dear, good, kind, handsome old man! <stage>(embracing Brown)</stage>
Why don’t you throw your arms round him too, John Horatio? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>John Horatio—Walker? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(aside to him)</stage> Yes—but no relation to the twopenny postman, on my
honour. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p><stage>(after a short pause and eyeing O’Walker with a savage earnestness,
then approaching him and in a loud whisper)</stage> So, sir!—— </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>I very much regret that most important business with the Austrian
Ambassador—— <stage>(going)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p><stage>(grasping his arm and stopping him)</stage> His Excellency must wait.
So, sir, <emph>you</emph> are the friend of your intimate friend’s friend after
all, are you? I thank you, John Horatio, for the<pb n="17"/> information, as it
will enable me to redeem my promise of immediately sweeping him off the surface
of the earth. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Be it so, but I claim an Irishman’s right of making his last speech.
<stage>(going towards l. and speaking off)</stage> Will any one oblige me by
stopping the first omnibus that goes near the Surrey Zoological Gardens, for the
purpose of conveying this gentleman back to his cage. <stage>(pointing to
Brown)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<stage type="entrance"> Enter Patty, L.—overhears O’Walker. </stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Patty.</speaker>
<p>Who? my B. B.! <stage>(running to Brown)</stage> Let any one lay a finger on
my intended, if they dare! <stage>(flourishing her clogs)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> Cousin Brown, your intended!—then why shouldn’t the two weddings take place
together? Come, Cousin Brown, give your consent—Mr. O’Walker’s moral character
will bear the strictest scrutiny. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Patty.</speaker>
<p>Like my B. B.’s. <stage>(Brown gives a savage laugh and looks at
O’Walker)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
<p>And I am the only woman he ever loved. <stage>(goes up)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Patty.</speaker>
<p>Like my B. B. again. <stage>(tenderly to Brown—goes up)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>Indeed!—the only woman he ever loved! ha, ha, ha, ha! <stage>(with a fierce
look at O’Walker, and slowly drawing the packet of letters from his
pocket)</stage> Of that I have abundant proof in these letters, which—— </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(suddenly grasping Brown’s arm and aside to him)</stage> Betray me and
I’ll instantly acquaint your intended wife with her B. B.’s little
eccentricities at a certain little tobacconist’s shop in Little Windmill Street.
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p><stage>(aside to him)</stage> Pooh! she won’t believe you! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Probably not; consequently, I shall refer her to you or rather to this
letter— <stage>(producing Brown’s letter)</stage> to the “loveliest of Amelias”
from the “fondest of Browns.” </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>Hush!—she’d tear my eyes out!—we are both standing on the edge of a frightful
precipice. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>We are; one step more, and over you go. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>And over <emph>you</emph> go. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>In other words, over <emph>we</emph> go. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>There’s only one thing to be done—let’s exchange letters. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Agreed. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>Here are yours! <stage>(gives packet of letters to O’Walker)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>And here’s yours—<stage>(about to give Brown the letter, stops)</stage> Stop!
You consent to my marriage with Fanny? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>No! <stage>(in a loud tone to O’Walker)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Very well. Ahem! <stage>(opening letter and about to read)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p><stage>(very loud)</stage> I do consent! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(to the Others)</stage> He does consent! <stage>(aside to Brown and
about to give him the letter)</stage> There—<stage>(stops)</stage> Stop!
<stage>(aloud)</stage> With a wedding portion of one thousand pounds? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>No—no! <stage>(aside to O’Walker)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Very well. Ahem! <stage>(about to read letter)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>Fanny shall have a thousand pounds! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p><stage>(aloud to the Others)</stage> He says Fanny shall have a thousand
pounds! <stage>(slips the letter into Brown’s hand)</stage> Generous,
liberal-minded man, allow me to embrace you—I don’t know why I should, but I do!
<stage>(embraces Brown)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
<p> And me too, cousin! <stage>(ditto)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
<p>And me, godpapa! <stage>(ditto)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Patty.</speaker>
<p>And me too, B. B.! <stage>(ditto)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>And now what say you to a comfortable dinner, by way of a wind up? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Agreed, and what’s more, you shall have the pleasure of paying for it.
<stage>(Brown about to remonstrate)</stage> Nay, I insist upon it—I don’t know
why I should, but I do! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>With all my heart. <stage>(looking at his watch)</stage> Let me see—ten
minutes past three—— </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Past three! <stage>(snatching Brown’s watch out of his pocket and looking at
it)</stage> It is!—that scoundrel Dibbs—I’m ruined!—and yet—I may catch him
yet—ah! <stage>(thrusting Brown’s watch into fob and looking towards l.)</stage>
Yes—there goes one—here, conductor—stop! stop! <stage>(opens his umbrella and
runs hastily, l., comes in contact with Schnipps)</stage>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>My tailor, again! It never rains but it pours—I don’t know why it shouldn’t,
but it don’t! Oh, Dibbs!—that scoundrel Dibbs! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Schnipps.</speaker>
<p>Dibbs! Oh, yes—he was the other bad gustomer I was talking about, but I got
to Bimligo just in time to stop him. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Stop him? </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Schnipps.</speaker>
<p>Yes, as he was getting into a cab; de police have got him and everybody will
have dere money back. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Schnipps, come to my arms, but for you I should have lost a fortune; and to
prove my gratitude, you shall instantly make me thirteen suits of clothes, and
what’s more, you shall put them down on the bill. <stage>(Schnipps about to
remonstrate)</stage> Not a word! I’m indebted to you—I’ve paid you and I’m
satisfied—I don’t know why I should be, but I am! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>Then, as I said before—— </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Voice.</speaker>
<p><stage>(outside)</stage> Now then—Islington! Holloway! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Brown.</speaker>
<p>There’s the Holloway omnibus, come along! </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
<p>Never mind, we’ll take a cab, there are only five of us—the three ladies
inside, myself on the box, and you on the top, that’s settled—now we’re off!—no
we ain’t—one moment—one word of advice before we part—instead of “Waiting for an
Omnibus in the Lowther Arcade on a Rainy Day” recollect there is an
establishment a few doors higher up, whose hospitable doors open every evening
at seven o’clock to all classes of Her Majesty’s subjects, who’ve got money
enough to pay for their admission—I needn’t say, I mean the Theatre Royal,
Adelphi! </p>
