     <stage type="setting">SCENE I — A Swiss village—On R.H. an inn; Sign, “The Rising Sun;” L.H.,
      Lottery office, in front of which is a board, displaying the list of prizes, viz., “65, 11,

     <stage>Enter Ninette and Rosine from inn.</stage>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p> (L.H.)Well, what is it to me? Cocklet has got a beating, and no doubt he deserved it.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p> (R.H.)You certainly take a great interest in your intended.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>Who intends he shall be my intended?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>Your father.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>But I am not inclined that he shall be my intended, while there are so many smart young men
       to look unutterable things at me, and so many handsome soldiers coming home. Do you think I
       shall make him so unhappy as to make him my <hi>worst</hi> half? Oh dear, no, Rosine! I love
       soldiers. It's the delight of my heart to look at their long swords and lovely
       mustachios!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>Perhaps you would not object to my brother? He's a soldier.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>Perhaps I should not.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>But suppose he has fallen in the wars?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>But what proofs are there?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>My father has heard so.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>Well, if I can't marry a soldier, I'll die an old maid. I'll never marry.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>Never?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>Never, never!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>Never is a long time.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>Not too long for my determination. To live happily, one must be—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>Oh! Marriage is like a—like a beautiful rose.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>  With plenty of thorns about it, to prick your fingers
       <pb n="4"/>occasionally. You can be cheerful—you will marry a soldier—my dashing brother,
       Victor, of the 20th regiment of cavalry;—while poor <hi>I</hi>, am condemned to your cousin
       Cocklet.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>But fools don't always make the worst husbands.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>But you were to tell me, Rosine, how it was your father allowed your brother to be brought
       up away from home, and the story of his going into the army, and all that.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>As I know you can keep a secret, I'll tell you one;—he is but my half-brother.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>Oh! Well?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>When my father was a young man he fell in love with a very beautiful creature, as you or I
       may be. His father desired him to marry another; and, as he had not courage to disobey his
       parent, nor the heart to forget his beautiful creature, he was placed in a very awkward
       situation.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>Very!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>However, he at last married my mother, and the poor beautiful creature, took it so much to
       heart, she would'nt shew herself to anybody; till at length, people said, they heard strange
       noises in the cottage, where the beautiful creature lived, like somebody hushing a baby. The
       fact is, I had a brother, who was brought up about twenty miles from hence, by a person, of
       the name of Jacquard, a farmer, at Merival, with whom he lived for sixteen years, when he
       quarrell'd with the farmer's son, and the farmer turned my brother   out of doors.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>And without letting him know who he was?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>How could he?—he was ignorant of it himself. At length, my mother died, and then, father
       ventured to enquire about him, when he learnt that he had enlisted in a regiment that was on
       its march to Poland.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>And if the report that he has fallen should turn out to be a false one, how would any of
       you be able to know him again, if he ever should return?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>The farmer knew the regiment he had enlisted in, and when my father explained the secret,
       he sent him a certificate detailing all the circumstances of his birth;—so it will not be
       difficult to recognise him when he produces that.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>And why, until this moment, have you always kept this affair a secret?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>Because I am so discreet.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>Indeed?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>To be candid with you, I never knew it myself till last night.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>You surprise me!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>My father and your father were locked up together in our green parlour. To that room is a
       door, to that door, there is a key-hole, and to that key-hole was an ear. (You could'nt.) I
       felt so interested—Hush! Your father.<stage>Enter Gavard from inn.</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p> (C.)Rosine, my dear, step and tell your father, if my son arrives this evening, I hope to
       have the honour of his company to   sup with us.</p>
     </sp>
     <pb n="5"/>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p> (R.)Do you think he'll arrive by this evening?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p>I received his letter, ten days since, from Nantes; so he can't stay much longer.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p> (L.)Poor fellow!—how impatient I am to see him!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p>I'ts ten years ago, since he left us. I declare, we shall scarce know him again. You,
       Ninette, were not ten years old when he turned soldier.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>Quite a little thing—not so high—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p>But now, he is to give over fighting, and enter upon a campaign in the field of Hymen. Oh!
       Rosine, you were a little thing <hi>too</hi>, when he went away; but you are sure to love
       him. Tell your father he will be expected, if Victor returns this evening;—but I must into
       the house again, and see that every thing is comfortable, to receive the dear
       boy.<stage>                                        Exit into Inn.</stage></p>

      <p>How delightful!</p>

      <p>  Will you cease, you military nightingale? There's an eye</p>

      <p>Where?</p>
     </sp>

      <p>There. <stage>(points to Ninette)</stage></p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>Pshaw! You must'nt be thinking of the girls now. Look this way—eyes left.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
      <p>No, no, this is our way. <stage>(Leon takes Fuzee's arm, and is dragging him towards
       Ninette and Rosine, when they pass to L.H., Ninette turns her head and looks at

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
      <p>She is looking at me, Fuzee. I'll be shot but she's looking at me! She turned her head.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>Nonsense!—it's <hi>your</hi> head that's turned.</p>

      <p>It's your father's we are going to—so we must pass them again. <stage>(Ninette and Rosine

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p> (L.H.)There's a repulse for you! I hope you'll not return to the charge.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
      <p> (R.A.)I'll not stir a step, from this spot, till they come out again.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>Nonsense! It's a guard will soon weary you. Come, there's a time for all things—for love,
       war, dancing, singing, eating,   and drinking—and for the two latter, my inward monitor tells
       me it is now the present time.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
      <p>But where's our money?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>Aye—another of your mad tricks—your passion for dancing, last night, brought us into a
       quarrel.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
      <p>Well, hadn't we the best of it?—didn't we put them all to the rout, bag and baggage?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>Took away all the women—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
      <p>Thrash'd all the men—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>Almost killed the Burgomaster's nephew—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
      <p>And lost all our money in the action.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>Exactly so. Then we returned with difficulty to our quarters—groped about for our
       haversacks in the dark—started upon a forced march without a single ration, not a sous in our
       pockets— the Gendarmes at our heels—and you stopping to wink your eye at a girl.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
      <p>But such a girl!—a delicious creature!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>A cold fowl would be a much more delicious creature to me at this moment.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
      <p><stage> (crosses to L.)</stage>You think of nothing but eating and drinking.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>And you think of nothing but the wenches.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
      <p>I've such a susceptible heart.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>And I've such an empty stomach.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
      <p>There's no pleasure without love.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>There's no pleasure without drinking.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
      <p>  'Tis love inspires the soldier!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>And wine!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
      <p>And they are the only things which constitute happiness.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>There I agree with you. Now, left face—march!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
      <p>Halt! I shall stay here.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>But without money?</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
      <p>You forget my lottery-ticket.</p>
     </sp>

      <p>Your lottery-ticket! I wish we had the six francs it cost.</p>
     </sp>

      <p>My numbers are 11, 28, and 40; and I think they'll win.</p>

      <p> (L.)Who are you seeking, Sir?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p> (C.)I'm seeking for my son—my dear son.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>Oh!—you are, Mr.—Mr. Gavard, dealer in wine and spirits! You are the father of my friend,
       and the master of the Rising Sun?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p>I am, Sir.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>Let me embrace you.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p>But where's my son? Why did'nt he come instantly to his father?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>He did'nt know the house.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p>That's impossible! He was sixteen when he left us, and though I've had the front newly
       painted, still he must remember the spot</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>True, but—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p>What?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>Ah! <stage>(sighing)</stage> I did not wish to break the unfortunate intelligence—you will
       perceive it, alas, too soon.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p>What has happened to my son?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
      <p> (R.)Good gracious! What has happened to the boy?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>Since the last time he was on the sick list—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p>On the sick list?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>  His head—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p>What?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>Since his severe fit, his brains are not exactly—you know what I mean—?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p>Is it possible?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>Fortunately he's only very dangerous at intervals: but for his memory—gone, Sir—quite
       gone!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p>But the letter which he wrote to me—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>I dictated that.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p>That was sensible enough.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>Of course. I had gathered the secret of your being his father from his lucid
       intervals—and—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p>But where is he now?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>He had a fit not five minutes since; so I seated him by himself, on a post in the next
       street, for a little repose. It's my method of treating him.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p>Are you sure he's my son?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>As for that, I really cannot answer.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p>He is called Victor Gavard.</p>
     </sp>

      <p>His name I'll answer for.</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Coc.</speaker>
      <p>But I wasn't at all daunted—oh no! I walked up to him, took off my hat, and to alarm him, I
       said, “Sir, what do you mean by that, Sir?—do you know who you have offended?” “I have not
       the pleasure,” said he. “Then,” said I, “know, Sir, that I'm my uncle's <hi>nevy</hi>.” “Then
       there's my love to you, and my compliments to your uncle;” and he hit me a plaguy hard slap
       on the side of my face.</p>

      <p>Well?</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Coc.</speaker>
      <p>Ay, but it wasn't well. That put me in a passion, and I gave him a kick;—and then the riot
       began. He tossed me about, as one would have tossed an orange—the lads came to my assistance,
       and a pitched battle commenced; then the other soldier set upon us —knocked us all down, one
       after the other—kissed and touzled all the women, young and old—and then scampered off,
       leaving me in this condition.</p>

      <p>They will punish you for beating Cocklet and endeavouring to impose upon Gavard. I have
       obtained the key of the little door here—it opens upon a flight of steps that lead to the
       garden. The night is coming on—there will be no moon, and you will easily escape unperceived:
       though in escaping, and leaving this place, you will have less to complain of than I.</p>

      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>Now, don't attempt to deceive me. I have taken an interest in your welfare, and would do
       you a kindness, and I must say, it is a great pity, so nice a young man, as you appear to be,
       should be such a shocking fellow.</p>

      <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
      <p>You are deceived, Rosine.</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>  That I might have forgiven, but for you to have such a strange taste as to encourage a

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>Now, you make me feel quite uncomfortable, to hear you tell such palpable stories. Victor
       Gavard has arrived, and is now in the house with a comrade, who is singing him to sleep with
       a half dozen of empty bottles of wine before him.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
      <p>It is some impostor, who has taken my name, but he shall confront me, and in my presence,
       he will not dare to persist in his deceit. Then, my dear Rosine, I trust you will not find me
       unworthy of you.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>Ah! could I but dare to hope.</p>

      <p>Do you then love me?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>Alas! I am afraid my fears, my hopes, and anxieties, upon your account, spring from a
       stronger feeling, than a little interest in your welfare.</p>
     </sp>

      <p>Dear, dear, Rosine, you restore me to new life, and, when I have confronted the villain,

       made the fattest major in the army! If I must be related to her, I trust it will be, in the
       capacity of a tender husband. So I'll undeceive her, throw myself at her feet, and take
       possession of the garrison—her heart. But, how is this? She told me to wait on the steps,
       leading to the door, while she went for the key of it, and I found it already open! Hollo!

      <p>That's true enough.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Louis.</speaker>
      <p>The Burgomaster has told me all; and, as a proof, I come on his part. He has confided this
       pocket-book to me, with your lottery ticket, and the certificate of your birth. You know it,
       don't you?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
      <p>Yes! that is the certificate of Farmer Jacquard and my old nurse. She told me to take every
       care of it. I'm rejoiced you have found it, and my lottery ticket. Huzza! I shall be a rich
       man at last, and marry my dear Ninette.</p>

      <speaker>Louis.</speaker>
      <p>Is perfectly safe. Oh, if you had but seen the tears flowing down the smooth cheeks of the
       Burgomaster when he mentioned you.</p>
     </sp>

      <p>What for?</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Louis.</speaker>
      <p>They were tears of joy. But he requests you not to say who you are till your discharge is
       signed. So be cautious not to mention your father's name.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
      <p>Not much fear of that, as I never heard it.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Louis.</speaker>
      <p>Because the affair would become public, and he doesn't wish the world to accuse him of
       favouring you, against the course of justice. Farewell; in two hours, at latest, I hope
       you'll be free.</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Louis.</speaker>
      <p>The interest of a father for his son to be sure.</p>

       pasty—attacked a fine regiment of black bottles that followed up in the rear—knocked their
       heads off in double quick time, and took the gentlemen prisoners. Nothing like victualling
       the garrison, in case of a siege and blockade. And if we should be obliged to decamp, without
       sound of trumpet, we sha'n't retreat empty handed. I'll hide some of the spoils of war here.

      <p>Don't have him Leon—stick to the tavern-keeper. Stop, stop—perhaps he'll father me—I want a
       father.</p>

      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p>Eh? let me see. The certificate was found by the Burgomaster in this soldier's pocket-book.

     <sp>
      <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
      <p>We slept last night in the same room. I, in the dark, took the wrong haversack.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p>And in the one, were my son's pocket-book and my letter to him.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
      <p>Because he had taken <hi>my</hi> haversack.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gav.</speaker>
      <p>Then you are <hi>my</hi> son. Oh, my dear boy! pardon the mistake!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
      <p>All is forgotten in your arms! <stage>(they embrace)</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>Then my brother is not my brother. How happy I am!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>So am I. The impostor is not an impostor. How delightful!</p>

      <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
      <p><stage> (to Leon.)</stage>But why did you assume my name?<stage>Ber. and Gav.</stage>Aye,
       why did you assume his name?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p><stage> (going on his knees between Berguin and Gavard)</stage>  I'm the culprit. In me,
       behold the demon who has caused all this confusion. The madness, the name, everything
       originated with me. 'Twas the pangs of an empty stomach that drove me to the desperate deed:
       but as that is appeased, I hope you'll be so too: and as I am sadly in want of a father,
       perhaps both of you—<stage>(to Gavard and Berguin)</stage>— will father me between you.</p>

      <p>Aye, aye, you shall be taken care of. <stage>                                        Fuzee

       Ninette to Victor, who crosses past Margot)</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ber.</speaker>
      <p>And here, my boy, is yours. <stage>(introduces Rosine to Leon)</stage> And now, as I see
       you all pretty well understand each other, change partners—cast off two couples—and go down
       the merry dance of matrimony, you rogues!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p><stage> (passing to Rosine)</stage>My dear Rosine!</p>

      <p><stage> (passing to Ninette)</stage>My dear Ninette! As for my prize in the lottery, that
       shall be divided between my wife and sister. And as for you, Fuzee—<stage>(crosses past
       him)</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>Gently—gently! I've some friends here, <stage>(pointing to bottles in R.H. corner)</stage>
       that I shouldn't like to have trod upon.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
      <p> (L.H.)Then it was you who took the wine I missed?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Fuzee.</speaker>
      <p>I was anxious to preserve a slip of such excellent vintage, to drink all your healths, as
       something whispered to me we should wind-up with a jollification.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Coc.</speaker>
      <p>But who's to recompense me for my assault and battery?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ber.</speaker>
      <p>That, my nephew, must be your wedding present.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Leon.</speaker>
      <p>  And now, having really found a father, <stage>(crosses to Ninette —Berguin crosses past
       Gavard—they meet in C.)</stage> all I wish for is, a kind and friendly circle of acquaintance
       to receive me and my dear Ninette. <stage>(to Audience)</stage> If your smiles beam a welcome
       on me and my comrades, all our efforts shall be directed to make us worthy of your
       friendship. And I trust you will never regret having received with favour THE BOLD
       DRAGOONS.</p>

       <l>Huzza! our many errors ended,    </l>
       <l>Yet our efforts are not vain, </l>

       <l>The Bold Dragoons mount guard again!</l>
