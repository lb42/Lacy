     <head>SCENE FIRST —Southampton Bar.</head>
     <stage>Archway C., backed by streets in perspective. Act opens upon a corner of a street in
      Southampton; R. and L. of 2nd grooves, two houses built out—one L., a military rendezvous and
      recruiting house, called, “The Iron Duke, kept by J. Dobbs,” the sign representing the
      Wellington effigy. The walls of the “public” bear the usual recruiting post bills—”Fine Young
      Men wanted,” “Who'll serve the Queen?” &amp;c., the other house, R., forming corner of a
      street, is a well-to-do looking middle-class residence. On the door is a large plate, upon
      which appears the name of “Trumble, Solicitor.” As curtain rises—to the tune of the “British
      Grenadiers”—Wattles, a recruiting sergeant, is discovered fixing huge bunch of ribbons on a
      countryman's hat. Triggs, Polly Dobbs and others, male and female, looking on a girl pouring
      out liquor. Some soldiers are lounging about door, and a semi-drunken band, consisting of a
      drummer and a fifer are playing at intervals— while, through the large open French window of
      Trumble's house, first floor, R., (this window must be so constructed that the action going on
      within the room is visible to the entire audience) Trumble writing at an old-fashioned bureau
      covered with papers.</stage>

      <p><stage> (C., after pinning on ribbons)</stage>There, a man needn't be born a seventh son to

      <p>Not serious! <stage>(to bystanders)</stage> Ladies and gentlemen, let me call your
       attention to this beautiful picture. Increase the nose, enlarge the forehead, bring out the
       chin, and change the entire expression of the countenance, and may I never taste ale again,
       but we've a living breathing likeness of <stage>(pointing to sign)</stage> the Great Duke

     <sp>
      <speaker>Triggs.</speaker>
      <p>No, don't—please don't. I've no pretension to anything of the kind; there isn't the
       slightest mystery concerning either of my parents, and I haven't such a thing as a strawberry
       mark anywhere about me.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>You'll take the Queen's money?</p>
     </sp>

      <p>  Not if I know it! I wouldn't rob her of a farthing.</p>

      <p>So I do—that is, I <hi>serve</hi> my countrymen. I'm a lawyer's clerk. <stage>(Wattles
       turns away in disgust and joins recruits, &amp;c. about door, while Polly Dobbs comes
       forward. Recruits and Soldiers gradually enter house, L., Sergeant and Drummer

      <p>Well, what nonsense you do talk, Joe; when you know I'm engaged to go to India with Mrs.

      <p>I've just taken leave of uncle, and my boxes are already on board. A girl must better
       herself, Joe.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Triggs.</speaker>
      <p>Better herself! Haven't I filed my declaration and made you a legal offer of

      <p>Most people who live in garrets have lots of those—acres of tiles, and forests of chimney
       pots!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Triggs.</speaker>
      <p>Oh, don't turn up your delicious little snub at   seventy pounds a-year! Economically
       managed it's a fortune.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Polly.</speaker>
      <p>Economically managed! do I look like economy?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Triggs.</speaker>
      <p>Fat and feelings should always go together.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Polly.</speaker>
      <p>Nonsense! the husband that I choose must be like a snail in one thing—he must bring me a
       house on his back. <stage>(with change of manner and extending hand)</stage> Goodbye, Joe;
       this is about the forty-fifth parting we have had during the last twenty-four hours.
       Good-bye, I shall come back again.<stage>                                        (Polly exits
       into house, L.</stage></p>

      <speaker>Triggs.</speaker>
      <p><stage> (with emotion, and dropping her hand)</stage>Come back! of course you will—thin,
       perhaps, and wife to a Nabob, and mother to half-a-dozen india-rubber looking children.
       <stage>(looking after her)</stage> Oh, woman, woman! once it was love, and now it's
       furniture. But I'm a neglecting business, though love is so much a matter of business
       now-a-days that it's difficult to know one from the other. <stage>(looking up at window of
       house, L.)</stage> There's Trumble, hard at work at the quarterly accounts, twisting noughts
       into sixes and nines—topping and tailing, he calls it. I was to be back in twenty minutes
       with Mr. St. Clair, but, bless me—what can time matter to old Trumble, except to charge for
       it? <stage>(Soldiers singing within tavern as Triggs exits, R. U. E. Trumble rises from
       chair, comes to window.)</stage></p>

      <speaker>Trumble.</speaker>

       all this noise. <stage>(glancing out as Soldiers, &amp;c., come down stage; Polly also
       re-appears talking to inn-keeper)</stage> Gallant fellows—they're to be shipped   off in a
       few hours, and it's a consolation to think that we mayn't see any more of them.
       <stage>(Recruits and Soldiers sit at table. Goes back to bureau and re-seats himself, as
       Robert Arnold, in the costume of a journeyman locksmith, enters at back, R., as turning the
       corner of tavern. He carries a basket of tools at his back, and is whistling
       merrily.)</stage><stage>Re-enter Polly, from house, L.</stage></p>

      <speaker>Robert.</speaker>
      <p>Hilloh, sergeant! Hilloh, Polly! <stage>(seizing her round the waist, gives her a kiss
       before she can prevent him)</stage> If you will put such tempting cherries in a hungry
       fellow's way you must expect he'll have a snap at them. Don't pout, Polly, or I'll repeat the
       offence out of desperation.
       <pb n="8"/> Let's have more beer—oceans more! I stand glasses round. <stage>(all shout and
       come forward)</stage> And Polly—<stage>(stopping her as she is going)</stage> touch the rim

     <sp>
      <speaker>Polly.</speaker>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Robert.</speaker>
      <p>Takes me out with him as confidential clerk, and <stage>(laughs)</stage> to reflect a
       lustre on the British army. <stage>(loud laugh in house, L. They go up stage laughing and
       talking. Trumble rises, places papers in bureau, which he locks, then re-appears at
       window.)</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Trumble.</speaker>
      <p>That fellow, Triggs, has loitered on the road as usual. I'd better meet Mr. St. Clair half
       way, for this noise is unendurable. <stage>(shuts window, as he does so Silas Jarrett appears
       at back, from L. Loud laugh in tavern as he enters. He pauses at sight of group before the
       tavern, and surveys the scene. He is a ragged young fellow with a sort of hybrid appearance,
       between a mendicant tramp and a dock labourer. A taste for gaudy colours is shown in the
       greasy red and yellow handkerchief twined about his neck, and the equally greasy ribbon that
       dangles from his torn straw hat. His hair, which is uncombed, hangs in tangled masses over
       his forehead, a sort of thatch, beneath which his eyes peer out in a sinister and savage
       manner.)</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
      <p>Curse them! what a row they're making! If I knew how to stop their merriment I would! I
       can't bear to see people enjoying themselves; it's an insult to my
       <pb n="9"/>rags and misery. <stage>(still unperceived by the joyous group about tavern door,
       he comes slowly forward, limping slightly, as footsore)</stage> Enjoy themselves! the fools!
       it's brief pleasure without money! There's Robert Arnold, honest, hardworking Robert—who's
       always mocking me, or patronising me with the insolence of his pity.
       <stage>(savagely)</stage> Honest Robert! good Robert! hardworking Robert! Ah! if hate could
       kill you'd have been dead long ago. <stage>(leans against wall of Trumble's house in the
       shadow, as Trumble comes out, closes door behind him, and passing Silas without notice, exits
       R. C.)</stage> There goes another sort of fool, a rich one, who plods! plods! plods! plods!
       like the working bee, not caring to enjoy the honey he creates. They're looking this way, and
       are talking about me no doubt. <stage>(changing manner suddenly to that of a man labouring
       under semi-intoxication)</stage>   There's no mask like drunkenness, behind it one can learn
       the thoughts of others, and conceal one's own.</p>

      <speaker>Wattles.</speaker>
      <p>Because I'm the only man from whom he won't take a shilling. By the way, have you ever
       remarked the singular likeness that exists between him and our young captain?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Robert.</speaker>
      <p>Who could be off remarking it. It's one of those freaks of Nature which Captain Ormond
       Willoughby has a right to complain of—that is, if he were aware of the existence of such an
       idle, quarrelsome vagabond.</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Clair.</speaker>
      <p>The whole business is one of simple justice. My uncle's death has left me master of an

      <speaker>Clair.</speaker>
      <p>Unjustly, as I'm most reluctantly compelled to believe. It's then for me, as my uncle's

      <p>Very poor! leaving a widow, as I understand, and   a daughter in England. My voyage to
       Madras is, as you know, to attend the bedside of my sick mother. Spare no pains in my absence
       to trace out the surviving members of the Armitage family. The re-assignment you already
       have, and this case which I have just received from my agent contains a sum sufficient to
       meet their possible necessities till my return.</p>
     </sp>

      <p>I'll wait for you here. We won't say good bye till the last bell rings. <stage>(Silas
       Jarrett who has again appeared at back just as St. Clair passes the leather note case to
       Trumble, starts as he hears the latter mention the money it contains—he creeps nearer,
       keeping within the shadow of wall, then crouches down close to ground, the head raised, the

       snake, till he commands a view of first floor window, through which Trumble is seen to enter
       room with light. He opens bureau, closes it, re-locks it, and then disappears. As he
       disappears, Silas, who has gradually raised himself first to his knees, then to his feet,
       retreats again into shadow, and glides off, rapidly, with a gesture of triumph, as St. Clair

     <stage>SCENE.—The Quarries at Dartmoor. The convict prison in middle distance, R. In extreme
      distance a vast extent of moor, wild and undulating, with large boulder rocks or tors. Down
      stage, L., huge boulders of slate, partially worked, a rough road is quarried among them,
      descending by a gentle incline to stage. To R. near C., and somewhat further up stage the dark
      boulders rise into a sort of hill, from the top of which another road is quarried, also
      descending amidst rock and ferns to and off stage. On the summit of this heap of rocks,
      stunted trees with other varieties of wild, coarse vegetation; framed, so to speak, by this
      foreground; the quarries stretch out behind, full of caves and crevices, towering up or
      descending suddenly into deep fissures, old or neglected workings half-hidden by the hardy
      herbage which clings even to these rugged rocks. The prison is on a height. A gloomy range of
      buildings, which, though distant, dominates by its very presence, the savage scene. Convicts
      are grouped everywhere about at work, quarrying or wheeling off slate in red trucks, under the
      guard of Warders, in dark blue uniform with white metal buttons (frock coat, leather belt,
      black varnished cap.) Some of these Warders carry muskets, others wear swords. The “Good
      Conduct” Convicts wear loose a frock with knickerbockers and coarse woollen stockings, all of
      a dirty blue with pink stripes. The “Bad Characters,” B. C., are clad in drab and black
      parti-colour, and they work with a belt fastened round the waist under the frock. All have the
      tunic cut frock, with
      <pb n="25"/>buttons in front, knickerbockers of same pattern—the B. C. “Bad Conduct” have one
      knickerbocker of black, the other drab, ditto stockings—the caps, more like those of the
      Chasseurs d'Afrique than the Glengarry, are of the same stuff as frock with same stripes—the
      boots strongly made highlows. The Convicts carry various quarrying tools, picks, &amp;c. As
      curtain rises, Robert Arnold, in “good conduct” dress is discovered at work, L.</stage>
     <stage>Enter Jack Snipe, with Two Convicts, R., also in “good conduct” dress, stops in his
      work, looks round to be sure that no warder is listening, then comes down stage. Several
      Convicts, who have also stopped work, follow his example. At rising of curtain, the Convicts
      are all at work, some wheeling barrows from back and off, L.</stage>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Robert.</speaker>
      <p>I can bear this fate no longer. Strength, hope, patience, everything has deserted
       me—everything but despair. What dreary months have passed since that terrible condemnation,
       and yet the crowded court is always before my eyes, and the stern voice of the judge sounding
         in my ears! Merciful heaven! what a fate for an innocent man! The very education my dear
       mother impoverished herself to give me that I might make my way in the world, only increases
       the sense of degradation. To be condemned to seven years companionship with men whose very
       aspect makes me tremble, better death in any form, so that it be swift and sure. <stage>(his
       head droops upon his breast, but he raises it quickly as Jack Snipe creeps up and slaps him

      <p>He died a fightin' the battles of his country, and his wife, who'd followed him half round
       <hi>this</hi> world when he was alive, thought it her dooty, poor thing! to follow him into

      <p>It were. Bless its 'art! it <hi>was</hi> a baby! Give it an oyster shell, or an old

       your track there's no place of safety like the lion's den! Its better to be the guardian of
       the cage, than to be shut   up in it one's self. Had I only secured the money and papers
       before I leaped from the deck of that cursed boat, I might have put myself beyond the
       possibility of pursuit. Now I have worked my way here to watch over my friend Robert
       Arnold—while he's in England there's no real safety for me! Fear and hate <stage>(he is
       glancing furtively towards Arnold as he speaks)</stage> are both powerful agents, but when

       one who can identify the real criminal—tell him that justice is already on his track, and—but
       why do you turn away? Say this for me, I implore you—and I will double your reward

     <sp>
      <speaker>Wattles.</speaker>
      <p>About an hour ago; and a hot march we've had of it, the country's swarming with rebels—and
       for the devils who have cut off our little detachment, and driven us in here, we'll give a
       good account of 'em, never fear.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Polly.</speaker>
      <p>Fear! Joe Triggs is brave as a lion; I've heard him say so, often.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Triggs.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, certainly, but that was when I was a
       <pb n="37"/>fraction of the British army, now, having bought myself out and taken a clerkship
       with Mr. Arnold, that I might be near you, Polly, I've dropped the lion, and
       <stage>(endeavouring to take her waist)</stage> cottoned to the lamb.</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Triggs.</speaker>
      <p>Don't, Polly, don't turn your back to me in that broad way! Who could resist such a wide
       expanse of English waist land?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Wattles.</speaker>
      <p>Don't make a stranger of me. There's nothing I admire so much as love-making, or a
       marriage, always providing I'm only a spectator. But I want you to tell me all about Robert
       Arnold; I heard <hi>something</hi> of the story when our regiment was back in England—it was
         quite a romance.</p>

      <speaker>Triggs.</speaker>
      <p>After making his escape from Dartmoor, quite ignorant of the steps that were being taken
       for his release, he got away on ship-board and worked his passage out to India, here, after
       no ends of ups and downs, he hears of his innocence having been proved, and of the arrest of
       that skulking, ne'er-do-well, Silas Jarrett!</p>

      <p>This dreadful rebellion has been a heavy blow to Mr. St. Clair, and it is said that but for

      <p><stage> (seriously)</stage>I know the full extent of the danger that threatens—and it is at

      <speaker>Alice.</speaker>
      <p><stage> (with dignity)</stage>The choice I have made, Sir Ormond Willoughby, carries with

       <pb n="46"/> Arnold. <stage>(she breaks out again in her natural gay, sunny way)</stage> And
       so, somehow you see, I grew to love him even before I knew what the word love really meant.
       Young as I am I know the honour reflected by a great name, a name such as yours, Sir Ormond;
       yet were Robert Arnold as obscure and penniless as he was when his name was first breathed
       into my childish ears, I would choose him above all others that the world contains—I daresay
       you   think me romantic, imprudent, silly if you will but— <stage>(drawing herself
       up)</stage>—I <hi>love</hi> Robert Arnold! I love him with all my heart! <stage>(as
       Willoughby turns away with a despairing gesture and as to hide his emotion, Alice, advancing,
       lays her hand quickly on his arm)</stage> You mustn't think me heartless or unfeeling, but
       Robert is so unhappy and I—I—<stage>(brushing tears from eyes)</stage>—am so very, very
       miserable, and we can never be happy unless you help us. I know it's my guardian's ambition I
       should be your wife, and—and—he's under great obligations to you so that—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Colonel.</speaker>
      <p><stage> (with generous warmth and taking both her hands)</stage>Oh! you mustn't speak of
       that—I'll be your friend Alice, though—<stage>(with an effort)</stage>—I'd have given him
       half my fortune had it been otherwise—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Alice.</speaker>
      <p>You'll be my friend then?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Colonel.</speaker>
      <p>It's a heavy sacrifice, but a true love should shrink from no sacrifice. <stage>(raising
       her hands to lips)</stage> And both Robert and yourself shall find a true friend in me.

       first above block of stone, upon which he painfully climbs, then crouches like a lizard,
       watching and listening.)</stage></p>

      <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, the reinforcements have arrived, but they've come by another route. <stage>(as he
       descends and comes down stage)</stage> My luck again. From England to Australia, in company
       with Vidler and that <hi>vindictive</hi> villain, the Polecat, who owed me a grudge for the
       bullet I put in his leg—I wish it
       <pb n="54"/>had been in his heart! A nice life of it I had among them till I slipped the
       chain, got on board ship, and worked my passage out to India. Yes, yes, it's only here,
       amongst the dead and dying, the boom of the cannon and the clash of steel, that I may hope to
       be passed over and forgotten. It has been a thundering good fight, though the very stream I
       paused to quench my thirst at, left a red stain on my lips. A grand fight—a tussle between
       bull-dog and wild cat; <stage>(distant roll of drum)</stage> and, as usual the bull-dog has
       the best of it. <stage>(as he moves up stage he starts)</stage> Hilloh, somebody behind the
       rock! <stage>(approaching stealthily)</stage> An officer! <stage>(stooping, he gently pulls
       the uniform coat, which comes off the extended arm)</stage> Phew! gold swabs too!
       <stage>(leans over as looking attentively at face—starts violently as recognising it, then
       with another whistle of surprise)</stage> Ormond Willoughby! the swell captain they used to
       chaff me about  in Southampton. <stage>(as if a sudden thought had struck him— looks at his
       own hands, passes one of them quickly over his face, looks again at body, then casts a
       hurried glance over his own figure)</stage> It would be a desperate game to play—it's worth
       the trial. <stage>(coming a little down stage, the uniform coat in his hand)</stage> What
       have I to lose? what have I to gain? Momentary safety, perhaps, and opportunity of escape.
       Now I know why those fellows saluted me, even in these rags. <stage>(searching pockets of
       uniform as he speaks)</stage> Yes, I'll do it! <stage>(casting aside his own ragged
       garment—he commences to invest himself in the Colonel's uniform, speaking rapidly the while;
       takes out purse, which he weighs in his hand)</stage> The sinews of war to begin with. What's
       this? a book! a diary. <stage>(hurriedly turning leaves)</stage> Queer notion—jotting down
       one's actions and ideas. <stage>(thrusting it back in pocket with short laugh)</stage> What a
       book <hi>I</hi> might have written! <stage>(all the time the action of this scene has been
       going on he has been looking nervously to R. and L.—suddenly he starts, clutches up his
       garments from ground, and retreats to rock; at same time the roll of drum is heard close off
       stage, then a glad shout)</stage> Nothing venture, nothing have. I've begun, and I'll go
       through with it; but first to get rid of—Silas Jarrett! <stage>(he disappears with body
       behind rock, L. U. E. The rolling of drums continues, then a crowd of Soldiers and Civilians
       —male and female—surges upon stage from various points, all in great excitement—Triggs, Polly
       and Wattles in their midst.)</stage></p>

     <head>SCENE FIRST.</head>
     <stage>—Oakfield Grange, Mr. St. Clair's house, near Southampton. Picturesque entrance to
      house, L.— small pavilion, R. U. E. Shrubberies, masking garden walks, L. C.—gates on country
      road—towards R. there is a garden fence—a small wicket gate, this gate, like the larger gates,
      is open—at extreme back trees, above which is seen ivy-clad tower of church—garden tables R.
      and L., with chairs —bird on table, R.</stage>
     <stage>Polly is busy with birdcage, R., hung against pavilion into which she is putting water
      and seed—rustic benches, seats, tables, &amp;c., dispersed about stage. Triggs, who is dressed
      in tweed suit and billy-cock hat, half-seated on rustic table, his foot on bench.</stage>

      <p>Well, your's is not one o' them forms as requires a tourist's telescope. <stage>(rising and

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Polly.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, but I won't be Mrs. Joe Triggs, nor Mrs. Anybody else as long as Miss Alice is so
       miserable. <stage>(laying her hand confidentially on his arm)</stage> You know, Joe, she
       loves Mr. Arnold.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Triggs.</speaker>
      <p>And I know that Mr. Arnold is over head and ears in love with her, but what of that?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Polly.</speaker>
      <p>Simply, that it can't be.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Triggs.</speaker>
      <p>Why, can't it be? Is there a more faithful lovyer in the world, except me? Why, when Mr.
       Arnold was brought wounded to the hospital and nursed through his long illness by Mr. Jack,
       was there any other name in his mouth but hers?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Polly.</speaker>
      <p>  He couldn't have a sweeter—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Triggs.</speaker>
      <p>And, when we'd got him on his legs again and he learned that Mr. St. Clair and Miss Alice,
       and yourself had departed for England, didn't he sell up everything to follow her? And wasn't
       it only when we got to Madras, that we learned that Sir Ormond Willoughby had sold out and
       also left for England.</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Polly.</speaker>
      <p><stage> (mysteriously)</stage>He's more than ever in love with Alice?</p>

      <speaker>Triggs.</speaker>
      <p>What, Sir Ormond?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Polly.</speaker>
      <p>Whether it was the siege, or the sea, or a sunstroke, or some unpleasantness of that kind,
       but, of all the changed men, Sir Ormond Willoughby is the changest.</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>Triggs.</speaker>
      <p>Why?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Polly.</speaker>
      <p>That's what I want to find out, as Mr. Jack used to say—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Triggs.</speaker>
      <p>Oh, don't talk of Mr Jack to me! that's another thing as upset Mr. Arnold. No sooner had
       our ship touched England's shore, than Mr. Jack disappeared and though a month has elapsed,
       we've never again clapped eyes on him.</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Polly.</speaker>
      <p>Then he'll meet Sir Ormond Willoughby as well, for the baronet joined Mr. St. Clair on the
       race course and returns with him. But what's the matter? You're not going, Joe?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Triggs.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, I am. <stage>(aside—and moving up stage)</stage> Better let Mr. Arnold know of this—I
       left him at the inn, reading Miss Alice's letter.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Polly.</speaker>
      <p><stage> (down stage)</stage>You'll be sure to come back, Joe?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Triggs.</speaker>
      <p>To doubt it, Miss Dobbs, shows your ignorance of anatomy. Where his heart is, there must
       Joe Triggs be. <stage>(as he turns to go up stage he runs against Isaac Vidler, who,
       disguised as a mendicant, is entering garden, C. He carries a walking stick)</stage> Beg

      <p>And would you have me reproach myself in the midst of our happiness? <stage>(placing her

      <speaker>Alice.</speaker>
      <p>  But poverty! ah, I know what poverty means— I saw and recognised its face when a child—a
       face as terrible as that dreadful one in the fable, which chills the warm blood in the veins,

      <speaker>Alice.</speaker>
      <p>Sir Ormond Willoughby is a changed man—to me, to all! So changed, that, at times, even his
       voice startles me, and I look up with doubt whether it can be the same man, once so generous

       believe I will permit you to be erased thus from my life without a struggle. No, a thousand

      <p>Mine is no common love, Alice! No love of yesterday. I have known you from a child—loved

      <p><stage> (who has slightly averted his face, now stands with his back half turned from

     <sp>
      <speaker>Robert.</speaker>
      <p>The words you said were these—“Alice has spoken to me—I know all—all!”</p>

       shrink from blighting the future of two lives. <stage>(suddenly pauses as Silas savagely
       looks into his eyes—both for a brief moment gaze fixedly and menacingly at each other, then
       Robert staggers a step back, but immediately recovers himself, again grasps Silas, this time
