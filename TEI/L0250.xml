    <p>The two little Dramas of <title>A Rough Diamond</title> and <title>Good for Nothing</title>,
     would not have been published but for the loss to the English Stage of one of its greatest
     ornaments,—the original representative of Margery and Nan. Whatever of goodness of heart,
     affection, cheerfulness, honesty, and self-sacrifice may be found in those characters, the
     truthfulness with which she pourtrayed such qualities may be mainly ascribed to the fact, that
     they existed in her own genuine and most genial nature.</p>

    <p>It was intended by the Author to keep these with other productions unpublished, and solely
     for the professional use of the late Mrs. Fitzwilliam; but the affliction he has suffered in
     losing one so dear to him having changed this intention, and prevented him ever again appearing
     as Cousin Joe or Tom Dibbles, he has been induced to print the Dramas in the hope that the
     female characters may be found suited to young and rising talent, of which the Stage at the
     present time unfortunately stands so much in need.</p>

   <head>A ROUGH DIAMOND.</head>



   <stage type="setting">SCENE.—A Country Residence—Door C., opening on a lawn with carriage way; on
    each side of the entrance are Statues—Door L.H.U.E.—An open door, R.H.U.E., leading to a
    Shrubbery—High flower stands on each side of the Stage, containing flowers—Plain chairs, &amp;c.
    &amp;c.</stage>

   <stage type="entrance">SIR WILLIAM EVERGREEN, heard without.</stage>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir William. </speaker>
    <p>Come in, come in—I’m delighted to see you. Harry, lead the horse to the stable.</p>
   </sp>

   <stage type="entrance">Enter SIR WILLIAM and CAPTAIN BLENHEIM from the back, C.D.</stage>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I thought it was a face I knew. I’m very glad to see you—it’s more than two years since we
     met! Where do you come from?—where are you going to?—and how d’ye do?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> My regiment is quartered about a mile off—we arrived there but yesterday—I knew you had a
     country house in the neighbourhood, and I had come in search of you.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Excellent! now I have indeed a companion, for I shall expect you to pass all your leisure
     with me. I thought you were abroad, as I had not heard from you so long.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> I have been stationed in Ireland.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> You’re looking in excellent health, and your spirits are as buoyant as ever, I’m sure.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> I have nothing to complain of as regards my health—my spirits I can’t say much for.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> What, any old creditors troublesome, or——</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> No, I’ve nothing to fear from them.</p>
   </sp>

   <pb n="6"/>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Some love affair—some tender attachment.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Now you’re right; I may as well be candid and tell you so.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Jilted, or rejected, or——</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Shortly after you left me at college, I formed an attachment to a young girl that I idolized
     with all the enthusiasm of youth.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Aye, aye; we generally begin that way.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> My passion was returned with equal fervor; when it became necessary that I should select my
     position in life. My friends suggested the army, and my inclination led me to adopt their
     views. Ireland soon became my destination—a constant correspondence with the object of my
     passion was my only solace in exile, and for months I almost daily opened a letter written by
     her dear hand.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> How delightful! I have often thought how charming it must be to receive an eloquent letter
     from a much-loved source—to have the colloquial grace of a Sévigné mingled with the fervor of a
     Heloise, or the moral delicacy of a Chapone. Oh, my dear fellow, I envy you!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Have you never experienced that happiness?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Never;—but proceed with your history, mine shall follow—you went to Ireland, and there
     received letters from the lady of your love.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> A long silence ensued.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> What anxious hours you must have passed.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Till one morning my servant placed a letter on my table—the object of my passion had married
     during her silence.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I guessed as much—always something ominous in a woman’s silence.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Her parents had met with misfortunes—a wealthy match presented itself—a match with a
     title.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> A match with a title!—ignition at once, of course.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> The temptation, added to the prayers of her friends, were too much for her. She yielded, but
     assured me she had done so with a broken heart—implored me to forget her—that her lot in life
     was cast, that the stern duties of her future existence should be fulfilled if she died in the
     struggle, yet confessed that I still occupied one little
     <pb n="7"/> corner in her heart, and concluded with a beautiful quotation from Milton.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> A refined mind, an educated divinity, no doubt—one formed to adorn the rank she had
     gained.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> She was indeed accomplished.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I thought so. Spoke Italian, no doubt?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Fluently.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> And French?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Better than a native.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> What a woman! Understood music?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> An enthusiast in the science.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> And mineralogy and archæology?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Perfectly.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> And the steam engine?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Yes.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> And the vestiges of creation?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Yes, and chaos, and everything.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> What a woman! I should have adored her. And you lost this professor in petticoats?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Irrevocably! She concealed the name and title of her husband, as she did not wish me to
     write in reply, as any reproach from me would but add to her wretchedness—and now you know the
     cause of my dejection.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I pity you from my heart. If you have <emph>lost</emph> a treasure, you should see the one
     that I have <emph>found</emph>.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> <emph>You</emph> are married, I hear.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Yes, I also formed an attachment to a young girl that I idolised. You have known me some
     years—that is to say, I was leaving college shortly after you entered, and you know how I have
     ever prized education—that it has been my watchword, my constant theme when I had a seat in
     Parliament. I don’t sit now, but that’s not <emph>my</emph> fault; but when I <emph>did</emph>
     sit, my constant agitation was education. “Educate,” said I, “educate! that is the panacea for
     every social evil!”</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> I’ve read your speeches.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> You should have heard them—will you hear one now?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Don’t trouble yourself.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Well, after dinner. One day, Sir, in riding through the country, my horse stumbled, and I
     was thrown
     <pb n="8"/> violently. My head encountered the edge of a stone wall; the wall being the hardest
     I was the only sufferer. Stunned and bleeding I was carried into a farm-house. My injuries were
     so severe that I was compelled to remain there for some weeks. The farmer’s daughter constantly
     waited on me, paid me so much attention, so amused me, so anticipated my every wish—in short,
     made herself so necessary to my comforts, that——</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> You——</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Exactly! I used to watch her every action as I reclined on my sofa. She was rude and odd,
     but there was a heartiness in her nature and a comeliness in her person that pleased me, that
     really fascinated me, till at last I began rather to love her.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> You love an uneducated country wench?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> It was silly, wasn’t it? but we are not our own masters in such matters. However, don’t
     laugh at me yet. I anticipated the pleasure of rightly directing her mind, of the happiness in
     possessing a subject on which to practise my favorite theory—in short, I pictured a whole life
     of felicity in educating the object of my affection.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> For which purpose you married her.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I did, to the great disgust of my connexions; indeed, my uncle, Lord Plato, has never
     visited me since my union—has never written, or noticed me in any way.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> But you found happiness in combining the character of husband and tutor?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I surrounded her with masters—an English master, a French master, a music master, a dancing
     master, a singing master, a philosophical lecturer, and a political economist.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> And what has been her progress?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Her progress has been entirely stationary. I can do nothing with her—she seems to rejoice in
     her ignorance—and, though I sometimes think she has a capacity for learning, my hopes have been
     so often disappointed that I now give her up. She’s a female Orson, Sir, though I confess I was
     once her Valentine.</p>
    <stage type="entrance">MARGERY, laughs without.</stage>

    <p>—There she is.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Very merry, at any rate.</p>
   </sp>

   <pb n="9"/>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, she’s merry enough, and good-humoured enough; but, my dear Sir, with <emph>my</emph>
     prejudices, with <emph>my</emph> ideas of refinement, with <emph>my</emph> delicacy as regards
     conduct in society, conceive my agony in possessing a wife who is as wild as an unbroken colt,
     finds a nickname for everybody, and persists in being called by her Christian name of—of——</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> What?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I’m ashamed to tell you—Margery.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Margery?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I have tried to persuade her to change it to Matilda, or Magaretta, or Marguerite, but all
     in vain—she says her mother’s name was Margery, her grandmother’s name was Margery, that her
     name is Margery, and Margery she’ll be to the end of the chapter.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Margery.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>without)</stage> Now, come along, Jack! and you, Tom, mind how you carry my
     kitten.</p>
   </sp>

   <stage>Enter MARGERY from the back, in a fashionably-made dress, but which she wears
    awkwardly—She is followed by TWO SERVANTS.</stage>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Now, Jack, mind what I say—how many pigs is there in the last litter? Oh, I know—eight!
     Well, you may send one to my cousin Joe—I’ll tell you where he lives by and by—two to my old
     dad, and one to Betsy Buncle, my old playfellow in Lancashire—the three black ones I shall want
     to have in the parlor to play with.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Pigs in the parlor to play with? Lady Evergreen, do you not perceive a visitor?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Wait a minute—I’ll speak to him presently. Do as I bid you; and you, Tom, give my kitten her
     lunch, and turn all the young terriers loose on the grass plot, because I like to see ’em
     tumble over one another—and now go.</p>

    <stage>Exit SERVANTS at back.</stage>

    <p>—Well, Sir, and how d’ye do, Sir? and <stage>(to Blenheim)</stage> how are you, and who are
     you?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> My dear, my dear, <emph>do</emph> think of your station! This is an old friend of mine—we
     were at college together. Captain Blenheim—Lady Evergreen.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(dropping a country curtsey)</stage> Hope you’re well,
     <pb n="10"/> Sir—fine weather for the hay, and nothing can look better as yet than the
     taters.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Hush, hush! don’t talk, my dear.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Then what did you bring him here for?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> I am delighted in being introduced to the wife of my old friend.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Well, I ain’t sorry to see you, if it comes to that, if only for a bit of a change, for my
     Billy here seldom lets anybody come a-visiting, and when I ask him why he don’t have a few
     friends now and then to kick up a bit of a bobbery——</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> My dear!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> I will talk! He says I’m too rough to mix up with his sort, and that he can’t bring ’em here
     or take me amongst them till I’m polished up; but I’m afraid I shall take so much polishing
     that I shall be worn out before I’m as bright as he wants me to be.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> I trust not, Madam.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> My dear, will you go into your——</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Not just yet—if I talk a little more to the gentleman he’ll get used to me, and won’t notice
     my grammar. And I’m not going to stand mumchance and try to talk that horrid gibberish you’ve
     been wanting to teach me, when I’ve got a good English tongue of my own. Leave me alone, Billy,
     or I’ll set Growler at you. Please don’t mind us, Sir <stage>(to Blenheim)</stage>, man and
     wife, you know, when in company often have a few snaps at one another on the sly, and, as it’s
     nobody’s business but their own, why, of course you don’t know what we’re snapping about, do
     you?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Certainly not, my lady.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Of course! I suppose <emph>you</emph>’ve been educated, haven’t you, Sir?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Your husband and I were at college together.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> I know what you mean—you were schoolfellows. Well, I dare say you’re very glad to see one
     another. I know I should be very glad to see my cousin Joe—we were schoolfellows, too—used to
     go to Old Mother Tickle’s, at the first house in the village, close to the duck pond. Oh, many
     and many’s the time I’ve pushed him into it—up
     <pb n="11"/> to his knees! Oh lord! it was so <emph>bong-bong</emph>—that’s a bit of French—do
     you understand it, Sir?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(who has crossed behind to Blenheim)</stage> Don’t you, don’t you pity me?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> I think her charming—it’s natural gaiety of heart, nothing more.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> No, no, you’re pleased to compliment.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(comes between them)</stage> Hallo! you’re whispering! where’s your manners,
     whispering before a lady? Is that your education, my dear?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I stand corrected.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Corrected? why, I haven’t touched you—though you deserve to catch toko, that you do.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Well, my dear friend, I shall expect you to dine with us to-day.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Ah, do! come and take pot luck!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Lady Evergreen, I implore you!</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> If he knows my meaning what does it matter? You’ll come, won’t you? Oh, do! and bring some
     of the sojers with you—I like sojers! What are you, a sharpshooter, or a—what d’ye call
     ’em?</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> No, no, my dear!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> I know, bless you! but I like what I used to see in the country—the—the yeo-ho—— No,
     yeo-ho’s sailors—the yeomanry, that’s it! I like them best—such red jackets with yellow
     insides, and a thing on their heads like a tin pot with a large fox’s brush pulled over it. Oh,
     didn’t they look prime!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Oh good gracious! oh good heavens! <stage>(stamps about in agony)</stage></p>

   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Well, Lady Evergreen, I shall certainly accept your kind invitation: I must return to my
     quarters for a short time, but will rejoin you in the course of half-an-hour. I am delighted at
     meeting you again, Sir William, and believe me equally delighted at my introduction to your
     excellent lady.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> That’s hearty! give me your hand—<emph>you’re</emph> the kind o’ man <emph>I</emph> like,
     after all.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Don’t be longer than half-an-hour.</p>

    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Good bye! Come again soon, now.</p>
   </sp>

   <stage>BLENHEIM goes off at the back—MARGERY calls after him.</stage>

   <p>—Captain! <emph>bon jour!</emph> There! that’s French, there’s a bit of education for him!</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Now, my dear, that we are alone, I must tell you that your behaviour has been
     abominable.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Oh! has it? Now if I didn’t think I was quite the lady!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> What with your directions respecting your animals, and your reference to your cousin Joe and
     the old woman your schoolmistress, and your ridiculous eulogium on the uniform of the yeomanry,
     I thought I should have taken to my heels and have run out of the house.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> I wish you had—I know I should have got on much better without <emph>you</emph> at my elbow.
     And as for my cousin Joe, he may be a stupid fellow and all that, but he’s a very good fellow,
     and if he don’t know how to make a proper bow, or a long speech like you do—such as when I’ve
     heard you practising to yourself about railroads, and borrowing money, and taxes, and the state
     of the nation, and situation of the population, and that horrible Education—<emph>he</emph> can
     talk so as I can understand him, and that’s more than I always can when you talk—and anybody
     else, for the matter o’ that. And if I did like the sojers I used to see so often, what harm
     was there in that? I’m sure the Captain was a fine man, a very fine man, whiskers and all—and
     I’ve often looked at him till I’ve felt as if I could eat him.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I know that you mean no harm—I know that your heart is pure; but you must learn to be
     conscious of your present station in society. The diamond, though of value in its rough and
     original state, must be polished and set before it can be worn. Now to-day, when I rang for the
     cook and wished you to commence giving your own orders for dinner, and had previously practised
     you in the
     <pb n="13"/> pronunciation of asking for <emph>cabillaud au gratin poulet
     roti</emph>—<emph>pomme de terre bute</emph>——</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Well, I couldn’t recollect it, and so I thought it best to ask for what I liked better than
     anything.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> And are you aware what you did ask for?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> I only asked for a toad in a hole.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> And didn’t you perceive the vain endeavour of the servant to conceal his laughter? didn’t
     you perceive my face suffused with blushes?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Well, I speak according to my knowledge, and I know I always speak the truth and what I want
     to say, without any beating about the bush; and that’s much better than being deceitful and
     making believe to be glad to see people when you really wish ’em at Jericho, and go grinning
     and smiling up to ’em, and shaking hands, when in your heart you’d like to shake ’em inside
     out—and make use of fine words and say beautiful things when you don’t mean it. You may call it
     polish if you like, but I call it telling lies.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> But the usages of society—the——</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> I don’t care! I shall follow my own usages, and I begin this morning by packing off my
     French master and my music master; and as for the dancing master, if he dares come here again
     and make my feet ache as he did yesterday, I’ll break his little fiddle over his head for
     him!</p>

     <pb n="15"/> she’s my old, my dear, my dearest friend—she was at school at the big house where
     I used to take fruit from the farm to all the girls, and she took a fancy to me—didn’t you,
     Polly? and I took a fancy to her, and we used to play together, and sing together, and then she
     came to my father’s and stopped a whole month when she had the measles. Oh dear! oh! I’m going

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, Polly dear! I never thought to see you any more! Let me look at you all over! Yes, it is
     the same—the same eyes, the same mouth, the same nose—all the
     <pb n="16"/> same! But you don’t laugh as you used—not look so merry. What’s the matter,
     dear?—don’t you do as you like? ar’n’t you happy in your mind?</p>

    <speaker>Lady P.</speaker>
    <p> A sadness oppresses me that I find very difficult to conquer.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Your husband worries you, I dare say—mine does sometimes, though he’s very good to me, one
     way and another. But I don’t like his wanting me to learn so much about nouns, and pronouns,
     and history—and then he gives me such dull books to read, all about astrology, and chronology,
     and physiology, and conchology, and etymology, and how many miles the moon’s off—just as if one
     wanted to know, as long as it shines. I can’t bear it! Give me Robinson Crusoe and the Seven
     Champions—that’s what I like! But with all his learning I can do what <emph>he</emph>
     can’t.</p>

     like yours. He seems a funny old fellow, and so grand too, and so upright, and his hair all so
     nicely floured over. What did you love him for?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady P.</speaker>
    <p> To gratify the wishes of my parents; the position that my union insured flattered and
     pleased me, while it removed the troubles of my family. I am grateful, very grateful, for his
     lordship’s preference, I confess—but—there’s——</p>

    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> I can understand—that is the one you like better, is it? Well, never mind, dear, don’t be
     afraid of your husband meeting him—they won’t fight, will they? and if they do, what o’ that?
     People that fight are often the best friends in the world when it’s all over.</p>

    <p> If you <emph>request</emph> me to leave the house, I can only obey.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> No, no, you mustn’t go—take him to your husband and say right out, “My dear, this is my old
     sweetheart, and you must not be jealous, and though I did like him once, what o’ that? I’m your
     wife now, and he can only be a friend, and there’s no harm in a friend coming to see me.” Be
     upright and downright, my dear—it’s the best way—for where there’s nothing concealed nothing
     can pop out.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady P.</speaker>
    <p> There are positions that exact great discretion from us—that absolutely render concealment a
     necessity, if only to avoid those explanations and confessions that <emph>must</emph> lead to
     mortification, if not to unhappiness.</p>

    <p> You don’t say so! Well, I always said Tom was a fool. Come close, Joe, don’t be shy—and, oh
     Joe! how comfortable this is, to have somebody to talk to in one’s own fashion! I do feel so
     free and easy again! Well, and tell me, Joe, is Dame Willows living?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Joe.</speaker>
    <p> No—died six months ago.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Did she leave all her money to her nephew, Jem Porter?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Joe.</speaker>
    <p> No, bless your life! Oh, there’s such work!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Come quite close—quite close, and tell me.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Joe.</speaker>
    <p> You see, Jem made sure of the money, and lived in such style—bought a horse and shay, and
     went to races, and played nine-pins—when, lo and behold! the old lady died and he found it was
     all left to a smooth-faced fellow that nobody never heard on, that got somehow or other into
     the old lady’s good books and she had it writ down. It was all because Jem one day kicked her
     favorite dog, that used to fly at everybody’s legs—now the dog’s gone to live with a baker, and
     Jem’s in prison for debt.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> And Harry Bacon, what’s become of him?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Joe.</speaker>
    <p> Gone to sea, because Mary Brown took up with a tailor what opened a shop from London. And
     you recollect Tom Hammer the blacksmith?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Yes.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Joe.</speaker>
    <p> Well, if he ain’t gone and bought all Merryweather’s pigs I’m a Dutchman! And Merryweather’s
     gone to America, and the eldest daughter’s married Sam Holloway the cutler, and folks say it
     ain’t a good match, because he was a widow with three children all ready
     <pb n="20"/> and she might have had Master Pollard the schoolmaster, and he’s gone and turned
     serious and won’t let the boys play at no games, and so they’re all going away to a new man
     that’ll let ’em do just what they like; and Will Twig has been found out stealing chickens, and
     he’s in prison; and Johnny Trotter the postman has opened a grocer’s shop; and they’ve pulled
     down the old parsonage and are building a new ’un; and the doctor’s got a large lamp over his
     door with big blue and red bull’s eyes; and there’s a new beadle, and all the parish children
     have got the hooping-cough, and Mrs. Jenkins’ cow’s dead, and—that’s all!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, Joe! I can shut my eyes and see everything and everybody you’ve been talking about, oh
     so plain! and to see you again does seem so like old times.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Joe.</speaker>
    <p> And didn’t we have games? when you used to climb up the cherry-tree, and call out to me,
     “Joe, come and help me, or I shall tumble down and break something!”</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Yes! and Joe, when my father used to take you and I to market, and we used to sit at the
     bottom of the cart and eat apples!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Joe.</speaker>
    <p> And when sometimes I used to try to give you a kiss, what knocks on my nose you used to give
     me!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Ah! didn’t I?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Joe.</speaker>
    <p> And when I got savage how I used to kick you wi’ my hob-nail shoes! Oh! how friendly we
     was—wasn’t we?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> And how we did sing!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Joe.</speaker>
    <p> And dance!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> And were so happy!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Joe.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, Margery!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, Joe!</p>
   </sp>

   <stage>JOE catches her in his arms and kisses her—At the same moment, SIR WILLIAM and LORD PLATO

    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Who is this fellow, and what is he doing here?</p>
   </sp>

   <stage>JOE, still seated, stares at SIR WILLIAM and makes him a bow—SIR WILLIAM repeats the
    question.</stage>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> It’s my cousin Joe. He was only giving me a kiss just now—and I was so glad to see him, and
     he was so glad to see me, that we—we couldn’t help it.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Joe.</speaker>
    <p> No, we couldn’t help it.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Plato.</speaker>
    <p> Exceedingly ingenious!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(to Margery)</stage> Oblige me by retiring to your room—and you, fellow, leave this
     place immediately.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Don’t send him away yet—we haven’t had half a talk together.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Joe.</speaker>
    <p> No, we haven’t had half a talk together.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Don’t you go, Joe.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Joe.</speaker>
    <p> I don’t mean to!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Your conduct, Madam, is most unbecoming! you forget your station—you forget that you are my
     wife!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> I’m sure I don’t, and I’m sure you take good care that I sha’n’t.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Joe.</speaker>
    <p> You take good care that she sha’n’t.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Hold your tongue, Sir! how dare you speak? I won’t be tethered so tight any longer, I can
     tell you—and I <emph>will</emph> be myself again! I’ve tried to be somebody else, and I can’t,
     and I’ll go and put on my old country clothes again—for I’ve no comfort in these—and then I can
     do as I like—kiss Joe, and you, and even that old gentleman—though I shouldn’t much like
     it.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Joe.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(after staring at Lord Plato)</stage> I shouldn’t like to kiss him.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Plato.</speaker>
    <p> Really! <stage>(going up)</stage></p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Margaret, I—— <stage>(turns sharply to Joe, who wears his hat)</stage> Take off your hat,
     Sir!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Joe.</speaker>
    <p> Eh?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(pointing to his hat)</stage> Take off your hat, Sir!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> I don’t want to quarrel, and I won’t quarrel, if you’ll only be kind to me; but I will be
     myself again, for since I’ve been married I feel as if my head, and my arms, and my legs were
     all put on the wrong way; and when I am myself again, if you don’t like me I had better go
     <pb n="22"/> back to my father, he’ll be fond of me if you won’t—so come along, Joe!</p>
   </sp>

   <stage>She runs off, followed by JOE, L.H.</stage>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I give it up! I can no longer pursue my darling theory—it’s all labour in vain!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Plato.</speaker>
    <p> I told you so, my dear Sir William, I told you so when you described the humble person you
     were about to honor with your hand—that the union could not be a happy one.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I admired her simplicity, her frankness—and I fondly imagined that if I could unite such
     qualities with education, with refinement, that I should create, as it were, a woman of
     perfection.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Plato.</speaker>
    <p> You now perceive the error of your speculation—the inutility of striving to elevate humanity
     from its natural position. There <emph>must</emph> exist separate grades of society—the
     patrician, the commoner, and the plebeian—seek not to amalgamate,—the process may be very well
     in a railroad, but with human nature it must ever create incongruities. Where’s Lady P.? Ah,
     there! could you have found another woman like that, how different would have been your fate!
     Well, as we have discussed the state of the nation, I must seek her—she’s in the house, no
     doubt fatigued with her journey. Don’t look so downcast, Sir William, there’s no help for it
     now—make the best of a bad bargain, for it’s an excellent observation, that there’s no making a
     silk purse—I need say no more.</p>
   </sp>

   <stage>Exit at back.</stage>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I am sorry, very sorry, to see this sad result of all my labour, and fear that much
     unhappiness is in store for both of us. How can I introduce my wife to society? how can I pass
     my leisure in the company of one so utterly uninformed, so incapable of conversation? Ah! my
     uncle is indeed happy! Blessed with a woman of intellect, whose natural graces harmonise so
     sweetly with her accomplishments, whose refinement is so exquisite, <emph>his</emph> life will
     pass like a dream of bliss—like a—— Eh? <stage>(looking off R.H.U.E.)</stage> my friend
     Augustus with a lady? with my—no; yes, with my aunt! They are in earnest conversation—she seems
     embarrassed, is weeping—what does it mean? He clasps
     <pb n="23"/> her hand, and she does not withdraw it—they come this way. I—I feel in a very
     awkward situation! I would not for the world let them be aware that I had seen them together—I
     had better retire, and not notice them. I will; I feel as if I had not the moral courage to
     face them. <stage>(he is about to go off at the back—he stops)</stage> They will see me if I go
     that way. I quite tremble! they’re here! I’ll conceal myself, and slip away as quickly as
     possible.</p>
   </sp>

   <stage>He passes behind the stand of flowers, L.H., and remains there unperceived by BLENHEIM and
    LADY PLATO, who enter R.H.D. at the same moment.</stage>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Permit me at least to <emph>write</emph> occasionally to you.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady P.</speaker>
    <p> If you will bring every philosophical argument, every delicate sophistry, to prove that one
     may have a confiding friend to whom one may unfold the heart’s dearest secrets, every emotion
     of the soul, every joy, and every sorrow, not only with safety, but propriety, you may, if you
     are discreet, periodically correspond with me.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Then I am happy! and, though my blighted hopes must ever be my theme, yet——</p>
   </sp>

   <stage>SIR WILLIAM steals from his place of concealment towards a statue near the door.</stage>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady P.</speaker>
    <p> Heavens! what’s that? I heard a footstep!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> ’Tis no one!—why are you so alarmed, so agitated?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady P.</speaker>
    <p> Leave me now! you have not been seen; go out again by the gate we saw near the shrubbery—it
     opens into the road. You returned here on foot?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> I did.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady P.</speaker>
    <p> Go then, I implore you! and, when you again arrive, no one need know that we have had this
     interview.</p>
   </sp>

   <pb n="24"/>

   <p>—Oh! don’t mind me! I’m so glad I’ve caught you, though, for if such a well-behaved gentleman
    as that is, can kiss my aunt’s hand, there can be no harm in my cousin kissing me.</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady P.</speaker>
    <p> Listen, my dear friend. I do not wish it to transpire that I have had an interview with the
     gentleman you saw just now—it would but cause explanations that must lead to disagreeables, and
     they had better be avoided. I shall therefore rely on your discretion.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> On my what?</p>

    <p> Your keeping my secret.</p>

    <p> Remember!</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> But stop, Polly—wouldn’t it be better not to mind anybody knowing anything? because it don’t
     seem loving and cosy to be sly, and to be frightened every minute in case somebody should say
     something about somebody that would make somebody else angry, and get everybody into trouble,
     and set everybody quarrelling with everybody. I don’t like it, Polly dear! where there’s
     secrets there’s no happiness, and no love—ah! and no goodness, if you come to that.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady P.</speaker>
    <p> Dear Margery, I feel your reproof, sincerely feel it—oblige me but for this once, and never,
     never will I again place myself in a position that shall cause me to conceal one thought or
     action—I will not, indeed!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>

   <p>—I just now felt so comfortable when I found myself once more in my old clothes, and was going
    to be so happy and so free, and now I’m in trouble again! I don’t like there being any secrets,
    and I know I’m the worst in the world to keep one—and as to my not telling about the Captain and
    my aunt having seen one another, I may try not to say a word, but it’s sure to slip out after
    dinner. What’s Polly afraid of? why does she want to make believe not to
    <pb n="25"/> know her old sweetheart? and I’m to help her in the make believe! I don’t like it!
    and I feel now as if I had stolen something, and had got it in my pocket, and that somebody was
    coming to search me.</p>

    <p> Why, Joe, what’s the matter now?</p>

    <p> What’s the matter? why, when you put me in that room full o’ pictur’s, and left me staring
     at ’em while you went to take off your grand clothes, your fine husband came in. “Hallo!” says
     he, “don’t stand in the chairs.” “How can I see the pictures if I don’t?” says I. “Sit down,”
     says he. Well, I did sit down—then he was at me again, and told me to go out of the room, and I
     said I shouldn’t—that my cousin had took me in, and neither he nor six of his servants should
     take me out.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> That was wrong, Joe.</p>

    <p> Then one word brought up another till I said something and then he said something, and then

    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> My dear Margery, there was no necessity for being so severe with your cousin, I had

Updated editions will replace the previous one- -the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away- -you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
