<p>The two little Dramas of <title>A Rough Diamond</title> and <title>Good for
Nothing</title>, would not have been published but for the loss to the English
Stage of one of its greatest ornaments,—the original representative of Margery
and Nan. Whatever of goodness of heart, affection, cheerfulness, honesty, and
self-sacrifice may be found in those characters, the truthfulness with which she
pourtrayed such qualities may be mainly ascribed to the fact, that they existed
in her own genuine and most genial nature.</p>

<p>It was intended by the Author to keep these with other productions
unpublished, and solely for the professional use of the late Mrs. Fitzwilliam;
but the affliction he has suffered in losing one so dear to him having changed
this intention, and prevented him ever again appearing as Cousin Joe or Tom
Dibbles, he has been induced to print the Dramas in the hope that the female
characters may be found suited to young and rising talent, of which the Stage at
the present time unfortunately stands so much in need.</p>

<stage type="setting">Scene.—A Country Residence—Door C., opening on a lawn with
carriage way; on each side of the entrance are Statues—Door L.H.U.E.—An open
door, R.H.U.E., leading to a Shrubbery—High flower stands on each side of the
Stage, containing flowers—Plain chairs, &amp;c. &amp;c.</stage>

<stage type="entrance">Sir William Evergreen, heard without.</stage>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir William. </speaker>
<p>Come in, come in—I’m delighted to see you. Harry, lead the horse to the
stable.</p>
</sp>

<stage type="entrance">Enter Sir William and Captain Blenheim from the back,
C.D.</stage>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> I thought it was a face I knew. I’m very glad to see you—it’s more than two
years since we met! Where do you come from?—where are you going to?—and how d’ye
do?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> My regiment is quartered about a mile off—we arrived there but yesterday—I
knew you had a country house in the neighbourhood, and I had come in search of
you.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> Excellent! now I have indeed a companion, for I shall expect you to pass all
your leisure with me. I thought you were abroad, as I had not heard from you so
long.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> I have been stationed in Ireland.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> You’re looking in excellent health, and your spirits are as buoyant as ever,
I’m sure.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> I have nothing to complain of as regards my health—my spirits I can’t say
much for.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> What, any old creditors troublesome, or——</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> No, I’ve nothing to fear from them.</p>
</sp>

<pb n="6"/>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> Some love affair—some tender attachment.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> Now you’re right; I may as well be candid and tell you so.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> Jilted, or rejected, or——</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> Shortly after you left me at college, I formed an attachment to a young girl
that I idolized with all the enthusiasm of youth.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> Aye, aye; we generally begin that way.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> My passion was returned with equal fervor; when it became necessary that I
should select my position in life. My friends suggested the army, and my
inclination led me to adopt their views. Ireland soon became my destination—a
constant correspondence with the object of my passion was my only solace in
exile, and for months I almost daily opened a letter written by her dear
hand.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> How delightful! I have often thought how charming it must be to receive an
eloquent letter from a much-loved source—to have the colloquial grace of a
Sévigné mingled with the fervor of a Heloise, or the moral delicacy of a
Chapone. Oh, my dear fellow, I envy you!</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> Have you never experienced that happiness?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> Never;—but proceed with your history, mine shall follow—you went to Ireland,
and there received letters from the lady of your love.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> A long silence ensued.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> What anxious hours you must have passed.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> Till one morning my servant placed a letter on my table—the object of my
passion had married during her silence.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> I guessed as much—always something ominous in a woman’s silence.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> Her parents had met with misfortunes—a wealthy match presented itself—a
match with a title.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> A match with a title!—ignition at once, of course.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> The temptation, added to the prayers of her friends, were too much for her.
She yielded, but assured me she had done so with a broken heart—implored me to
forget her—that her lot in life was cast, that the stern duties of her future
existence should be fulfilled if she died in the struggle, yet confessed that I
still occupied one little <pb n="7"/> corner in her heart, and concluded with a
beautiful quotation from Milton.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> A refined mind, an educated divinity, no doubt—one formed to adorn the rank
she had gained.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> She was indeed accomplished.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> I thought so. Spoke Italian, no doubt?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> Fluently.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> And French?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> Better than a native.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> What a woman! Understood music?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> An enthusiast in the science.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> And mineralogy and archæology?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> Perfectly.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> And the steam engine?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> Yes.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> And the vestiges of creation?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> Yes, and chaos, and everything.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> What a woman! I should have adored her. And you lost this professor in
petticoats?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> Irrevocably! She concealed the name and title of her husband, as she did not
wish me to write in reply, as any reproach from me would but add to her
wretchedness—and now you know the cause of my dejection.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> I pity you from my heart. If you have <emph>lost</emph> a treasure, you
should see the one that I have <emph>found</emph>.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p>
<emph>You</emph> are married, I hear.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> Yes, I also formed an attachment to a young girl that I idolised. You have
known me some years—that is to say, I was leaving college shortly after you
entered, and you know how I have ever prized education—that it has been my
watchword, my constant theme when I had a seat in Parliament. I don’t sit now,
but that’s not <emph>my</emph> fault; but when I <emph>did</emph> sit, my
constant agitation was education. “Educate,” said I, “educate! that is the
panacea for every social evil!”</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> I’ve read your speeches.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> You should have heard them—will you hear one now?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> Don’t trouble yourself.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> Well, after dinner. One day, Sir, in riding through the country, my horse
stumbled, and I was thrown <pb n="8"/> violently. My head encountered the edge
of a stone wall; the wall being the hardest I was the only sufferer. Stunned and
bleeding I was carried into a farm-house. My injuries were so severe that I was
compelled to remain there for some weeks. The farmer’s daughter constantly
waited on me, paid me so much attention, so amused me, so anticipated my every
wish—in short, made herself so necessary to my comforts, that——</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> You——</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> Exactly! I used to watch her every action as I reclined on my sofa. She was
rude and odd, but there was a heartiness in her nature and a comeliness in her
person that pleased me, that really fascinated me, till at last I began rather
to love her.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> You love an uneducated country wench?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> It was silly, wasn’t it? but we are not our own masters in such matters.
However, don’t laugh at me yet. I anticipated the pleasure of rightly directing
her mind, of the happiness in possessing a subject on which to practise my
favorite theory—in short, I pictured a whole life of felicity in educating the
object of my affection.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> For which purpose you married her.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> I did, to the great disgust of my connexions; indeed, my uncle, Lord Plato,
has never visited me since my union—has never written, or noticed me in any
way.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> But you found happiness in combining the character of husband and tutor?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> I surrounded her with masters—an English master, a French master, a music
master, a dancing master, a singing master, a philosophical lecturer, and a
political economist.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> And what has been her progress?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> Her progress has been entirely stationary. I can do nothing with her—she
seems to rejoice in her ignorance—and, though I sometimes think she has a
capacity for learning, my hopes have been so often disappointed that I now give
her up. She’s a female Orson, Sir, though I confess I was once her
Valentine.</p>
<stage type="entrance">Margery, laughs without.</stage>

<p>—There she is.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> Very merry, at any rate.</p>
</sp>

<pb n="9"/>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> Oh, she’s merry enough, and good-humoured enough; but, my dear Sir, with
<emph>my</emph> prejudices, with <emph>my</emph> ideas of refinement, with
<emph>my</emph> delicacy as regards conduct in society, conceive my agony in
possessing a wife who is as wild as an unbroken colt, finds a nickname for
everybody, and persists in being called by her Christian name of—of——</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> What?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> I’m ashamed to tell you—Margery.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> Margery?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> I have tried to persuade her to change it to Matilda, or Magaretta, or
Marguerite, but all in vain—she says her mother’s name was Margery, her
grandmother’s name was Margery, that her name is Margery, and Margery she’ll be
to the end of the chapter.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_F6">
<speaker>Margery.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(without)</stage> Now, come along, Jack! and you, Tom, mind how you carry
my kitten.</p>
</sp>

<stage>Enter Margery from the back, in a fashionably-made dress, but which she
wears awkwardly—She is followed by Two Servants.</stage>

<sp who="#L0250_F6">
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p> Now, Jack, mind what I say—how many pigs is there in the last litter? Oh, I
know—eight! Well, you may send one to my cousin Joe—I’ll tell you where he lives
by and by—two to my old dad, and one to Betsy Buncle, my old playfellow in
Lancashire—the three black ones I shall want to have in the parlor to play
with.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> Pigs in the parlor to play with? Lady Evergreen, do you not perceive a
visitor?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_F6">
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p> Wait a minute—I’ll speak to him presently. Do as I bid you; and you, Tom,
give my kitten her lunch, and turn all the young terriers loose on the grass
plot, because I like to see ’em tumble over one another—and now go.</p>

<stage>Exit Servants at back.</stage>

<p>—Well, Sir, and how d’ye do, Sir? and <stage>(to Blenheim)</stage> how are
you, and who are you?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> My dear, my dear, <emph>do</emph> think of your station! This is an old
friend of mine—we were at college together. Captain Blenheim—Lady Evergreen.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_F6">
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(dropping a country curtsey)</stage> Hope you’re well, <pb n="10"/>
Sir—fine weather for the hay, and nothing can look better as yet than the
taters.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> Hush, hush! don’t talk, my dear.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_F6">
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p> Then what did you bring him here for?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> I am delighted in being introduced to the wife of my old friend.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_F6">
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p> Well, I ain’t sorry to see you, if it comes to that, if only for a bit of a
change, for my Billy here seldom lets anybody come a-visiting, and when I ask
him why he don’t have a few friends now and then to kick up a bit of a
bobbery——</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> My dear!</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_F6">
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p> I will talk! He says I’m too rough to mix up with his sort, and that he
can’t bring ’em here or take me amongst them till I’m polished up; but I’m
afraid I shall take so much polishing that I shall be worn out before I’m as
bright as he wants me to be.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M3">
<speaker>Blen.</speaker>
<p> I trust not, Madam.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> My dear, will you go into your——</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_F6">
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p> Not just yet—if I talk a little more to the gentleman he’ll get used to me,
and won’t notice my grammar. And I’m not going to stand mumchance and try to
talk that horrid gibberish you’ve been wanting to teach me, when I’ve got a good
English tongue of my own. Leave me alone, Billy, or I’ll set Growler at you.
Please don’t mind us, Sir <stage>(to Blenheim)</stage>, man and wife, you know,
when in company often have a few snaps at one another on the sly, and, as it’s
nobody’s business but their own, why, of course you don’t know what we’re
snapping about, do you?</p>
</sp>

<p> Now, my dear, that we are alone, I must tell you that your behaviour has

</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_F6">
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p> Oh! has it? Now if I didn’t think I was quite the lady!</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> What with your directions respecting your animals, and your reference to
your cousin Joe and the old woman your schoolmistress, and your ridiculous
eulogium on the uniform of the yeomanry, I thought I should have taken to my
heels and have run out of the house.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_F6">
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p> I wish you had—I know I should have got on much better without
<emph>you</emph> at my elbow. And as for my cousin Joe, he may be a stupid
fellow and all that, but he’s a very good fellow, and if he don’t know how to
make a proper bow, or a long speech like you do—such as when I’ve heard you
practising to yourself about railroads, and borrowing money, and taxes, and the
state of the nation, and situation of the population, and that horrible
Education—<emph>he</emph> can talk so as I can understand him, and that’s more
than I always can when you talk—and anybody else, for the matter o’ that. And if
I did like the sojers I used to see so often, what harm was there in that? I’m
sure the Captain was a fine man, a very fine man, whiskers and all—and I’ve
often looked at him till I’ve felt as if I could eat him.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> I know that you mean no harm—I know that your heart is pure; but you must
learn to be conscious of your present station in society. The diamond, though of
value in its rough and original state, must be polished and set before it can be
worn. Now to-day, when I rang for the cook and wished you to commence giving
your own orders for dinner, and had previously practised you in the <pb n="13"/>

</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_F6">
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p> Well, I couldn’t recollect it, and so I thought it best to ask for what I
liked better than anything.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M2">
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p> And are you aware what you did ask for?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_F6">
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p> Well, I speak according to my knowledge, and I know I always speak the truth
and what I want to say, without any beating about the bush; and that’s much
better than being deceitful and making believe to be glad to see people when you
really wish ’em at Jericho, and go grinning and smiling up to ’em, and shaking
hands, when in your heart you’d like to shake ’em inside out—and make use of
fine words and say beautiful things when you don’t mean it. You may call it
polish if you like, but I call it telling lies.</p>

<p> Can’t you stop here a day or two before you go to your place? we would have
such fun—for though my <pb n="19"/> husband has often said that none of my
family must come here, as he wanted me to forget all their ways, yet as you
<emph>are</emph> here, I think I could coax him to let you stop. Sit down,

</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M4">
<speaker>Joe.</speaker>
<p> No; they were going to be married only a week ago, and when they got to the

crying her eyes out at the porch door.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_F6">

<p> You don’t say so! Well, I always said Tom was a fool. Come close, Joe, don’t
be shy—and, oh Joe! how comfortable this is, to have somebody to talk to in
one’s own fashion! I do feel so free and easy again! Well, and tell me, Joe, is
Dame Willows living?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M4">

<p> No—died six months ago.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_F6">

</sp>

<sp who="#L0250_M4">
<speaker>Joe.</speaker>
<p> You see, Jem made sure of the money, and lived in such style—bought a horse
and shay, and went to races, and played nine-pins—when, lo and behold! the old
lady died and he found it was all left to a smooth-faced fellow that nobody
never heard on, that got somehow or other into the old lady’s good books and she
had it writ down. It was all because Jem one day kicked her favorite dog, that
used to fly at everybody’s legs—now the dog’s gone to live with a baker, and
Jem’s in prison for debt.</p>

<p> Well, if he ain’t gone and bought all Merryweather’s pigs I’m a Dutchman!
And Merryweather’s gone to America, and the eldest daughter’s married Sam
Holloway the cutler, and folks say it ain’t a good match, because he was a widow
with three children all ready <pb n="20"/> and she might have had Master Pollard
the schoolmaster, and he’s gone and turned serious and won’t let the boys play
at no games, and so they’re all going away to a new man that’ll let ’em do just
what they like; and Will Twig has been found out stealing chickens, and he’s in
prison; and Johnny Trotter the postman has opened a grocer’s shop; and they’ve
pulled down the old parsonage and are building a new ’un; and the doctor’s got a
large lamp over his door with big blue and red bull’s eyes; and there’s a new
beadle, and all the parish children have got the hooping-cough, and Mrs.
Jenkins’ cow’s dead, and—that’s all!</p>

<p> You now perceive the error of your speculation—the inutility of striving to
elevate humanity from its natural position. There <emph>must</emph> exist
separate grades of society—the patrician, the commoner, and the plebeian—seek
not to amalgamate,—the process may be very well in a railroad, but with human
nature it must ever create incongruities. Where’s Lady P.? Ah, there! could you
have found another woman like that, how different would have been your fate!
Well, as we have discussed the state of the nation, I must seek her—she’s in the
house, no doubt fatigued with her journey. Don’t look so downcast, Sir William,
there’s no help for it now—make the best of a bad bargain, for it’s an excellent

<p> I am sorry, very sorry, to see this sad result of all my labour, and fear
that much unhappiness is in store for both of us. How can I introduce my wife to
society? how can I pass my leisure in the company of one so utterly uninformed,
so incapable of conversation? Ah! my uncle is indeed happy! Blessed with a woman
of intellect, whose natural graces harmonise so sweetly with her
accomplishments, whose refinement is so exquisite, <emph>his</emph> life will
pass like a dream of bliss—like a—— Eh? <stage>(looking off R.H.U.E.)</stage> my
friend Augustus with a lady? with my—no; yes, with my aunt! They are in earnest
conversation—she seems embarrassed, is weeping—what does it mean? He clasps <pb

a very awkward situation! I would not for the world let them be aware that I had
seen them together—I had better retire, and not notice them. I will; I feel as
if I had not the moral courage to face them. <stage>(he is about to go off at

<p> Oh, that I shall! yet I <emph>will</emph> try my hardest to be as you would
wish me, if you but let me try in my own way; and I am sure, in time, you will
not be ashamed of me. Don’t give me masters, don’t give me books, but when you
want me to learn, teach me <emph>yourself</emph>—a loving word and gentle
patience, and all from <emph>you</emph>, will make us both happy, and me I hope
sincere. <stage>(to Audience)</stage> And, what will be better still, let but
the Rough Diamond be firmly set in <emph>your</emph> golden opinion, and she
will be sufficiently polished to shine as long as you will permit her.</p>
