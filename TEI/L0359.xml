   <div type="scene">
    <stage>SCENE I.—A view by a river side; on the opposite bank are seen the backs of
     houses—immersed in water, as at Blackwall, &amp;c.</stage>

    <stage type="entrance">Enter TOM, with a large hamper, L. H.</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
     <p>Come, this will do; though its utility exceeds its beauty; a confoundedly ugly basket,
      though destined to hold most rare contents: several sugar loaves, a canister of tea—black and
      green, almonds and raisins in abundance, coffee, rice, and spices, bars of soap, starch and
      powder, blue enough to stock a small shop. Dear Fanny! if her heart is not won by such a store
      of valuables, it is indeed hard.</p>
    </sp>

    <stage type="entrance">Enter Reckless, L. H.</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Reck.</speaker>
     <p>Ha, ha, ha, I’ve found her—What you here?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, sir.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Reck.</speaker>
     <p>I have found her, I’ll tell you; congratulate your fortunate master, most faithful
      Thomas.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
     <p>Have you indeed found Miss Julia, and how?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Reck.</speaker>
     <p>Simply saw her at a house window.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
     <p>But you cannot get into that house.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Reck.</speaker>
     <p>No; but I have got my mark, the means of hitting that mark are still in fortune’s
      hands.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
     <p>And in worse hands they could not be; sir, do give up this scheme. You fall in love with a
      young lady at a boarding school, correspond with her under a feigned name—</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Reck.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, you know that arose from the fear of my cousin, old Guineamore, hearing of these
      matters. I dared not trust my own lady love. You are aware I have immense expectations from
      him, and that he hates anything like adventures.</p>
    </sp>

    <pb n="4"/>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, and Reginald de Mowbray is a much prettier name than Ralph Reckless, but where was I?
      Oh, a feigned name. Well, the young lady’s governess finds out the correspondence, and very
      properly sends her to her guardians, who takes her into the country, also very properly; give
      up this scheme, sir—</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Reck.</speaker>
     <p>Not I; when I have found the retreat of my charmer, the cavern where the treasure is hid,
      shall I be craven knight enough to fear the dragon that guards it? No, man, not I—so if you
      have not better advice to give, we’ll change the subject. What the devil is that great basket
      for?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
     <p>What? oh, that is an affair of the heart; you have confided all your tender secrets to me,
      therefore I will do the same to you, sir, if you will allow me.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Reck.</speaker>
     <p>Certainly, good Thomas, go on.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
     <p>Why, a sort of a relation of mine—a grocer, died the other day, without a will, and his
      stock in trade got divided among six of us. I have borrowed this large crate from Delfs, the
      crockery-warehouseman, to stow my share in; and am thinking I could not do the genteel thing
      better, (as my sweetheart Fanny’s in service, and has to find such articles out of her wages,)
      than to make her a delicate present of the groceries, to sweeten my progress in her
      affections—eh, sir?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Reck.</speaker>
     <p>Delicate indeed! that I should have so gallant a man in my service; and where does this
      happy maiden reside?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
     <p>You see that white house, the other side of the water? one of those houses in the
      water.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Reck.</speaker>
     <p>What! the white one?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, she is housemaid there.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Reck.</speaker>
     <p>Oh! ha, ha, ha! Ri tol de rol. <stage>(dances.)</stage></p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
     <p>Hey day. Did you tell me to order a straight waistcoat, sir?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Reck.</speaker>
     <p>No! tol de rol, I have a thought—</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
     <p>Why, you do look remarkable thoughtful.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Reck.</speaker>
     <p>You see these three bright gold sovereigns?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, sir! perhaps you will allow me to <emph>feel</emph> them too?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Reck.</speaker>
     <p>So I will, Tom, on one condition! send <emph>me</emph> in
      <pb n="5"/> that basket instead of the grocery, and carry me to the house where my Julia is
      secluded.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
     <p>Well, sir, but what will Fanny say?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Reck.</speaker>
     <p>Never mind her, there shall be a genteel note pinned outside the basket, explaining the
      contents. Then, I’ll give her a couple of sovereigns, so pack up and be gone.</p>

    <stage>SCENE II.—A parlour.—In centre of stage a sofa, capable of being made into a bed. At the
     back a globe, covered with a glazed cover. A dining table and chair. A cupboard to open at top
     and bottom, R.—A large window to open, L.</stage>

    <stage>(MRS. FACILE, with a pestle and mortar, and JULIA, R. H., discovered.</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>Really, my dear, the best advice I can give you, is to employ yourself about something, it
      will divert your mind.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
     <p>Divert? I don’t want to be diverted, I want to be miserable; it’s very unkind of you to try
      to console me.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>I can only say I mean well, and I believe your guardian means well.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, so is every horrid thing <emph>meant</emph> well. Our governess used to make us wash
      our hands in icy water in winter, and tell us it was all for our good. I hate what is for our
      good.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>But consider the impropriety of your forming at school, a clandestine attachment with a
      young gentleman, of whose very residence you are ignorant.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
     <p>And what is propriety? A creature of imagination, framed by old maids under the inspiration
      of green tea.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>Stop, stop—</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, what times were those, when I used to look for a note from Mowbray, in the key hole of
      the green gate, when I used to read it to six especial confidants, who were all dying with
      envy; ’till one quarrelled
      <pb n="6"/> with me about a slice of my last cake, betrayed me to the French teacher, who told
      the head teacher, who told the governess—and then what an explosion! dragged off hither,
      without letting me even send my address to De Mowbray. It is a fine thing to be a victim of
      cruelty at seventeen. And now as you are so fond of giving advice, let me ask you why you are
      so very severe to that unfortunate little man, your husband?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>What you call severity, arises from my strict sense of propriety, of which I am sorry to
      say, Mr. Facile has not so strict a sense.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
     <p>No! why for all I can see, the poor dear little man does nothing but sit with his
      mathematical books before him all day, looking just like our geography master. Then he is such
      a very easy man.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>The very thing I dread; he not only lets me have my own way, but every one else too. He is
      the confidant of all the young ladies in the village; the very servants ask his advice on
      every single point, and he gives it—is never affronted.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
     <p>Dear, good-natured soul!</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>There’s that Fanny Pepper has innumerable points to consult him upon—a forward slut, who
      apes me in everything. If I wear ringlets, she wears ringlets—makes her caps like mine. Now
      how do I know what she may ask him—and if he can refuse nothing—think of that!</p>
    </sp>

    <stage type="entrance">Enter EUCLID, reading, R. H.</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Euclid.</speaker>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>Can you address me in that calm manner, after what I said this morning about Fanny the
      housemaid?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Euclid.</speaker>
     <p>True, my love, you did say something; but I don’t remember what it was.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>Only been married three weeks—come down to spend the honeymoon with your relation, Mr.
      Holdfast—and already the confidant of all the maid servants, and don’t remember what I
      said!</p>
    </sp>

    <pb n="7"/>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Euclid.</speaker>
     <p>No, dear, I only remember the agreeable things you say.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>How provokingly good-tempered! I am cruelly used by your indifference.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Euclid.</speaker>
     <p>Are you? upon my word I did not mean it. I am not indifferent, am always thinking of
      you—given, a, b.</p>

    <stage type="entrance">Enter FANNY, L. H.</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
     <p>Please ma’am, Miss—</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Euclid.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, I forgot! while I was out this morning, I bought this case of drawing instruments for
      you—there, dear.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>And so, sir, you hope to atone for your conduct by a paltry present. <stage>(runs to window
      and opens it.)</stage> Thus you atone, and thus I treat the atonement. <stage>(throws case out
      of window.)</stage></p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(aside.)</stage> Lauk-a-dasy me; how fine that was. I wish my sweetheart would
      quarrel with me, and send me something—would not I shy it out of window!</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>There, sir, you see what I have done.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Euclid.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, love, you threw the case out of the window.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>And does it make no impression?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Euclid.</speaker>
     <p>Why, it was your own; you had a right to do with it as you liked; it was nothing to me, you
      know.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>Oh! obduracy, in the disguise of good nature.</p>

     <speaker>Fanny.</speaker>

     <p>What, Fanny, you here! <stage>(aside to Julia.)</stage> There, as I told you, her hair
      dressed the same—the ribbons in the cap too. Well, Fanny.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
     <p>Please, ma’am, Miss Weakley has sent to know if you are going to call there this
      afternoon?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, yes, certainly—poor Miss Weakley. Yes, I shall call.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(whispers to Euclid.)</stage> I have something to shew you, sir, when your good lady
      goes out.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>I shall call—what’s the girl waiting for? do you think I can’t <emph>call</emph>?</p>

     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>Discipline, I tell you. But reach me the decanter of wine from the shelf, that’s a dear.
      <stage>(pours contents of mortar into decanter.)</stage> There—there’s the sleeping draught
      for Miss Weakley; I made it from a receipt book belonging to my grandmama. Such a draught! it
      will make her sleep like Juliet’s drug, worthy of the book from which it was extracted.</p>

    <p>This transcription is based on images digitized by Google from a copy made available by the
     Ohio State University and posted by the HathiTrust at <ref target="http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100593073">catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/
     100593073</ref></p>

    <p>Because a few page scans had text cut off next to the margin, this transcription has been
     compared with the text posted by the Victorian Plays Project at: <ref target="http://victorian.nuigalway.ie/modx/assets/docs/pdf/Vol24xivTwice.pdf">victorian.
     nuigalway.ie</ref></p>

    <p>In general, this transcription attempts to retain the punctuation and spelling of the source
     text. Variant spellings have been retained, including “calender,” “terrestial,” “accomodation,”
     and “dosing” (for “dozing”), as have inconsistent spellings such as “lattitude” and “latitude.”
     Obvious errors have been corrected. The use of “its” and “it’s” has been made consistent.</p>

    <p>The following changes were noted:</p>

    <list>
     <item>Frontispiece: The punctuation of the caption text has been made consistent with the
      script text.</item>

     <item>p. 3: though it’s utility exceeds it’s beauty—Changed “it’s” to “its” in both
      cases.</item>

     <item>p. 5: its very unkind of you—Changed “its” to “it’s”.</item>

     <item>p. 6: “X plus Y. equal to—”—Deleted the period after “Y”.</item>

     <item>p. 8: [Men <emph>do so and exeunt., </emph>l. h.—Deleted the period after
      “<emph>exeunt</emph>”.</item>

     <item>p. 13: Fanny. (screams,) Oh!—Changed the comma after “<emph>screams</emph>” to a
      period.</item>

     <item>p. 14: I was rowing past a quarter of ah hour ago.—Changed “ah” to “an”.</item>

     <item>p. 17: Mr. Feargus Fable, my old friend’s son, will be here in a minute—Changed “Feargus”
      to “Fergus” for consistency.</item>

     <item>p. 17: what is the lattitude of Petersburgh.—Changed the period after “Petersburgh” to a
      question mark.</item>

     <item>p. 20: Careless slut, what did you drop the tray for:—Changed the colon after “for” to a
      question mark.</item>

     <item>p. 21: always happy to see you, you know—Inserted a period after “you know”.</item>

     <item>p. 21: I must sit up rather rate, to finish a job—Changed “rate” to “late”.</item>

     <item>p. 24: Tom., Fan., Mrs. F., Euc., Julia., Reck., Hold., Fab.—Deleted the period after
      “Julia”.</item>
