    <head>A note to participants in the Pictorial Punch Study Day, British Library, Nov. 7,
     2025</head>
    <p>Thank you for downloading this draft of my edition of Henry Silver’s “diary” (as he called
     it) of <title>Punch</title> table-talk. To my knowledge this is the only full and reliable
     transcription of this remarkable document, the original manuscript of which is part of the
     British Library’s wonderful <title>Punch</title> Archive. I have added links to open access
     versions of cartoons and articles alluded to in the diary in order to make them easy to consult
     as you read, a convenience that I think is particularly useful when comparing the discussion of
     the weekly “Large Cut” cartoon with the actual cartoon that was published in the magazine.</p>
    <p>An introduction and various appendices are in preparation, but in the meantime I would be
     grateful for any questions, comments, or corrections. Please send these to me at <ref target="mailto:pleary@gmail.com">pleary@gmail.com</ref> . For background to the diary you may
     wish to consult my book, <title>The Punch Brotherhood: Table Talk and Print Culture in
      Mid-Victorian London</title> (British Library, 2010).</p>

    <head>[Silver's own introduction to the diary, written in 1908.]</head>
    <p>The first article I wrote for Mr. Punch was sent without my signature when I was in my
     twentieth year. It appeared in February 1848 under the heading of “Obituary,” – Vol. 14 p. 47 –
     and recorded, with some humour, the death, at the ripe age of eighty-five, of a Big Elephant in
     Wombwell's travelling Menagerie, then staying at Norwich, where I was a law student. Not long
     afterwards I became a fairly regular contributor, and for several years received a guinea a
     column – the usual fee then to “outsiders” – the column then containing over 1000 words, and
     not 800 as it has done in the Twentieth Century. And then quite suddenly, and at a short
     interval, Mr. Punch lost two efficient members of his Staff. Gilbert a Beckett, who had written
     for the First Number – dated Saturday, the Seventeenth of July 1841 – wrote also for the Number
     dated Saturday August Thirty 1856, the day on which he died. And his death was quickly followed
     by that of Douglas Jerrold, in the following month of June. And so – ab illo quantum dispar!
     [how unlike him] – I was asked to join “The Table” in his place. </p>
    <p>The first Dinner I went to was held at the “Star and Garter,” Richmond, on the last Saturday
     of August 'Fifty Seven. “Covers drawn at Six Sharp - Morning Toggery” – wrote Mark Lemon, in
     his brief note of invitation. We dined in a big room, at the back of the hotel, and the Senior
     of the Proprietors, Mr. William Bradbury presided at the feast. Sitting on his right, I had a
     good view of the river, which was really then worth looking at: for the Silver Thames was
     brightly shining beneath the golden sunset, and there were then no boatsheds or big chimneys to
     uglify the landscape.</p>
    <p>On my right sat Mr. Peter Rackham, an old friend of the Firm: who, with Sir Joseph Paxton,
     enjoyed the frequent privilege of dining with the Punch folk. Facing Mr. Bradbury sat his
     cheery partner, “Pater” Evans, with Tom Taylor on his right hand, and John Tenniel on his left:
     and they, with Shirley Brooks and Horace Mayhew, made up “the Octave” – as it might be called
     now, though I fancy in the 'Fifties the word was only used in the Johnsonian sense.
     ...Thackeray, Leech, and the “Professor” Percival Leigh were all away from home.</p>
    <p>We had doubtless a good dinner, and no doubt I quite enjoyed it: for I was young enough to
     look on a good dinner as a noteworthy event, while a good appetite came naturally more than
     once a day. I seem vaguely to remember that the Elders, between whom I was sitting, seemed just
     a little envious of the ease whereby I ate the <hi rend="underline">entrées</hi> they declined,
     and yet, like Goldsmith's Gourmand, “kept a corner” for the dainty little “Maids of Honour”
     that were notable among the sweets of Richmond Hill.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="2">
      <p> “Maids of honour” tarts, puff pastry shells filled with sweetened cheese curds or jam,
       have long been associated with the borough of Richmond. Tradition dates their origin to the
       court of Henry VIII at Richmond Palace, and commercial production was begun as early as the
       18th century. The quoted reference is to Oliver Goldsmith's verses to Lord Clare, <ref target="https://llds.phon.ox.ac.uk/llds/xmlui/bitstream/handle/20.500.14106/K113595.000/K113595.000.html?sequence=5&amp;isAllowed=y">“The Haunch of Venison,”</ref> in which the dinner-guests vow to “keep a corner” for the
       venison pasty.</p></note></p>
    <p>I recollect, moreover, that when dessert was on the table, “Pater” achieved the perilous feat
     of bowling a big pineapple at his partner, who had asked him for a slice of it. And I feel
     pretty sure that not a single wineglass was broken in the transit. Then cigars were lighted –
     cigarettes were things despised then, and even fast young ladies carried a cigar case, as Leech
     showed in this week's Number [<ref target="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.32106010020862&amp;seq=100"><title>Punch</title> 33 (29 August 1857): 92</ref>] ... What we chiefly talked about is now
     a “blank in faithless memory void.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="3">
      <p> From Walter Scott, “The Lay of the Last Minstrel” (1805), line 77. The full lines, which
       close the poem's introduction, are: “Each blank, in faithless memory void, The poet's glowing
       thought supplied, And while his harp responsive rung, 'Twas thus the <title>Latest
        Minstrel</title> sung.” Silver used the phrase in his note for February 21, 1859,
      below.</p></note> But I remember that Shirley Brooks made pretence of a Debate on the Cartoon,
     “Just to give the New Fellow some notion how we do it.” So he proposed the parody of Millais'
     picture, which appeared next Wednesday [<ref target="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.32106010020862&amp;seq=107"><title>Punch</title>, 33 (5 September 1857): 99, '“The Order of Release”: With Mr. Punch's
      Apologies to Mr. Millais'</ref>].<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="4">
      <p> Parliament was prorogued (that is, adjourned) on August 27, 1857, until
      November.</p></note> Parliament was sitting late this Session and was yesterday prorogued: and
     both Palmerston and Punch were glad to be relieved by the “Order of Release.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="5">
      <p> Silver's footnote: “The famous Cartoon of “the British Lion's Vengeance on the Bengal
       Tiger,” which Shirley Brooks suggested, appeared in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_British_Lion%27s_Vengeance_on_the_Bengal_Tiger.jpg">Punch of August 22. '57 [pp. 76-77]</ref> and increased the Circulation.”</p></note></p>
    <p>And before ten o'clock, on the Hotel Omibius he and I and other Juniors, with the Seniors
     inside, were taken to the Railway. “And so Home, mighty pleased” – as Mr. Samuel Pepys would
     say – after a very pleasant Evening.</p>

    <p>“We all have our places” says B[radbur]y, turning up the cloth and showing me JL’ s [small
     drawing of Leech’s signature of a leech in a bottle] cut on the deal, and “W.M.T.” next it.
     “D.J.”’s on B.’s right, P. Leigh, the Professor, at Southampton and Ponny – alias Horace Mayhew
     – at Scarborough. </p>
    <p>White soup and salmon – champagne out of tumblers –seltzer and cigars. No puddings allowed –
     “because we don’t care for them” says S.B. in January, when E. wonders we don’t have them. E.,
     like H.S., has a weakness that way. </p>
    <p>M.L. jolly and full of fun – takes a paternal interest in T. now J.L. is in Scotland. “My
     dear Tenniel – now don’t eat too much salmon – think of your big cut – champagne? – here
     Hayward, champagne to Mr. Tenniel – pray attend to him Hayward and see that he wants nothing.
     Go fishing my dear T? – not if I know it! There’s a policeman always watching you – sometimes
     he appears as an organ man sometimes an old beggarwoman – etc. etc. pleasant chaff – tells of
     his being cross examined: “Are you a Jew?”— No. – “Do you know his handwriting” – Yes – “only
     seen him write once and yet you swear” – Yes – “What did you see?” “I saw him accept that
     bill.” Counsel shut up.</p>
    <p>Preparations for Big Cut business – inkstand and sheet of paper to M.L. “What is it to be?”–
     I say “What a nuisance is that ‘Please to remember the Grotto’” – whereat S.B. says “Wouldn’t
     that do – Cherbourg grotto – John Bull” – don’t see it myself, but M.L. says “Good- Punchy” –
     And that J.T. sees it next Wednesday proves. [ <ref target="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$c190121&amp;seq=75"><title>Punch</title>,

      <p> Louis Napoleon had intended the invitation as a reassurance to Britain of his peaceful
       intentions, but its ultimate effect was to alarm British suspicions. For the larger

        Rivalry, 1840-1870</title> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993); the dust-jacket of this volume

       Music-and-Supper Rooms at 43 King Street, Covent Garden, a popular dining room celebrated by
       Thackeray in <title>The Newcomes</title> as The Cave of Harmony. “My Dinners” probably refers

    <p>To change the talk – and one beauty of the Knights of our Round Table is that their

     become of me?” – He replies, “My love, for God’s sake, let’s take a more cheerful view of

       comic history of humanity. Some men would, I believe, write the Comic Sermon on the Mount.
       ...Surely the world will be sick of this blasphemy. I can only say for myself, at times I am
       ashamed of my literary companionship and its perpetrators” (259). The recollection by Evans
       that Jerrold was starting a comic magazine called “The Pen” at the same time, and that he
       “did no work,” are both mistaken. The effort to start such a magazine came three years later,
       while the <title>Punch</title> contributors ledgers show that Jerrold continued to contribute
       steadily to <title>Punch</title> throughout the last twelve years of his life. For a helpful
       discussion of this passage in the diary and of Jerrold's relationships with his
        <title>Punch</title> colleagues more generally, see Michael Slater, <title>Douglas Jerrold

    <p>Poets discussed: chief charm of poetry is its suggestiveness – horrors should not be

     quoted? Capital memory has S.B.) more terrible in its indistinctness than the cut and dried

       pressed him for the list of volumes he would choose. But Shirley protested that it was not

       that not more than three English novelists (himself of course not among them) should be

     the Bishop of London’s. T.T. comes merely “to hear what you fellows say about the Reform Bill”
     – which Diz brought in on Monday. Begins discussing it at once. H.M. condemns it: does nothing
     for the working man. T.T. thinks people look to <title>Punch</title> and that
      <title>Punch</title> should take a decided course. P.L. and M.L. think we should stand by, and
     see how the stream runs first. All agree that Walpole acted as a man of honour in resigning;

      <p> Thackeray long suffered from a painful urethral stricture, possibly the result of an early
       venereal infection. In his old age, artist Charles Keene, writing of his own “plumbing
       disrepair,” recalled: “I often now think of poor Thackeray how he used to groan when he
       retired behind the screen by the Old Punch Table!” Keene to Francis Burnand, undated but
       probably ca. 1889 (Keene mss., Lilly Library, Indiana University).</p></note> Says to me, “I
     went to Charterhouse the other day. Hadn’t seen school come out since I left. Saw one little
     fellow with his hands behind him and a tear upon his cheek, and 2 little cronies with their
     arms round his neck – and I knew what had happened and how they’d take him to the bog and make
     him show his cuts. Talking of cuts, how about the Large One?”</p>
    <p>Thackeray suggests, lawyer, doctor and schoolmaster, brought up as prize boys and Diz
     presenting them with votes. H.S. thinks of Diz launching Reform ship, lopsided: query “Will it
     Swim?” – M.L. hints, Dizzy joining hands of artisan and yeoman: giving each a vote. Thackeray
     suggests working man coming among gentlemen and saying, “What have you done for me?” P.L.
     thinks the situation would be shown by poking up the British Lion” not yet roused: and then if
     he gets roused we can have another cut of him with his tail and monkey up, says S.B. Idea
     gradually approved [ <ref target="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.35740795&amp;seq=83"><title>Punch</title>,

     old fashioned cut of the starving virtuous British Workman, with Death in the background – wife
     and children dying, while the B. W. refuses work till he can have his rights. </p>
    <p>Splendid mill between Ponny Mayhew, or the Regent St. Pet, and Pater Evans and John Leech,
     the Aristocratic Stunners. Ponny lets fly by saying <title>Punch</title> is standing still –
     used to take the lead, but now fears to do so. Avançons! Evans returns, “But times are altered,
     my dear Ponny, and <title>Punch</title> alters with the times. Strong language has done its
     work and there’s now no need of it. Nobody talks now about the trampled working man and the
     Dignity of Labour. Poor not crushed now as they were 15 years ago.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn83" n="82">

     Leech, “I’m a man of extremely simple tastes. Give me my claret and my hunter and I ask not for
     more.” Apropos this of Bohemianism which Ponny cracks up. “Charley Kenny [sic] lives on £5 a
     week: and is a d—d clever fellow,” says Ponny. “His own fault, then, he don’t earn more,” says
     E. “Never was a time when penmanship more at a premium.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="83">
      <p> Miscellaneous journalist and author Charles Lamb Kenney (1821-1881) at one time had

     than any man at this table. “What has he done,” says Leech. “Tell you what he don’t do,” says
     S.B., “he don’t wash much, if he writes much.” Quotes dictum of Mrs. Watts Phillips – “Wash his
     hands! – he ought to boil them! Should have them scraped, like horse-radish.” “Would do for the
     Stinking Tosh Club,” says J.L. “Ah,” says Ponny, “You never admit the talent of anyone but
     yourself, Leech. Nil admirire is your motto.” Nil what?” says Leech., “I don’t admire Brough
     because I don’t know what he’s done. He’s a d—d clever fellow, no doubt, but what has he done
     to prove it?” <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="84">
      <p> Robert Barnabas Brough (1828-1860), versatile writer for periodicals, novelist, and
       burlesque writer, had been associated, with his brother William, with such rivals to
        <title>Punch</title> as <title>Man in the Moon</title> and <title>Puppet Show</title>. At
       this time he was working with Sala on the <title>Welcome Guest</title>. Known for his
       Bohemian tastes, radical politics, and amiable personality, he was the principal founder of
       the Savage Club. Brough and his brother were both related to Mark Lemon by marriage, each
       having having married a cousin of Lemon’s wife, Nelly, whose maiden name was Romer. See the
       thoughtful 2012 essay by <ref target="https://cyndereli.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/robertbarnabasbrough.pdf">Cynthia Dereli, “Robert Barnabas Brough: a republican writer of the mid-nineteenth
        century.”</ref></p></note> “There’s Sala, too,” says Ponny – “another d—d clever fellow.”
     Says Evans, “If Mr. Sala had been a gentleman, he should have had a seat at the
      <title>Punch</title> table.” Well, I envy these Bohemians,” says Ponny. “Wish I were one of
     them.”“Don’t kick me,” says S.B., for Ponny’s getting excited. Talks politics again and cries
     out, “Avançons!” and “excusez moi” and spouts French till J.L. says, “There, don’t talk like a
     lady’s maid. Why can’t you speak English.” Says S.B., “Chacun a son gout, if you come to
     speaking French, take that.” H.M. quotes dictum of Brough, that Planché would frig himself in
     white kid gloves, as a proof of his d—d cleverness. Every man his own woman says H.S. (to
     himself).</p>

    <p>Talk of the Fight<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn135" n="134">
      <p> In what would later come to be seen as the first world boxing championship, British
       champion Tom Sayers and American champion John C. Heenan (also known as “The Benicia Boy,”
       from a town in California) fought at Farnborough in Hampshire on Tuesday, 17 April 1860.
       After a long battle in which both men suffered – Sayers could not use his right arm, while
       Heenan’s face was badly swollen – the crowd surged into the ring and the police intervened,
       leading the referee to call the fight a draw. Public interest was intense, and press coverage
       extensive.</p></note> first of course – S.B. doubts if Heenan had fair play and M.L. says
     he’s sorry to hear an Englishman say so, and especially at this table. Woods did the
      <title>Times </title>account – also, that of the Great Eastern blow up.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn136" n="135">
      <p> Nicholas Augustus Woods (1830-1880), journalist, had been the Crimean War correspondent of
       the <title>Morning Herald</title>, and was afterward renowned for his descriptive reporting
       for the <title>Times</title>, the <title>Pall Mall Gazette</title>, and other papers. <ref target="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b111051&amp;seq=176">See G. A. Sala,

       by Bradbury &amp; Evans.</p></note> J.L. at the Market Harbro’ Steeplechase, splendid! says
     ladies all talking of Sayers, so he drew in Album portrait of him “coming up Smiling.” Children
     playing at prize fights – “You be Tom Sayers and I’ll be the B.B.! ... T.T. engages to do the
     fight – might, if he were writing on t’other side of the water begin with the Arma vircum
     [?]:</p>
    <p>Arms and fists too I sing, the hero from Troy (County, U.S.)</p>
    <p>Who fought like a Trojan, th’ Benicia Boy.</p>
    <p>Well, certainly for pluck and endurance the battle was nearly a drawn one, but considering
     the long odds Tom fought against, and having but one arm to fight with, I think we should
     consider him the best man. Heenan lost his temper at last and Tom never did. A lucky tap would
     have done the business, so although he’d been knocked down 20 times we mustn’t think him
     beaten... Of course the penny papers come the moral dodge and are virtuously indignant. But
     where’s your educated gentleman of sufficient self control to go without wine, women and
     tobacco for 3 months as these “ruffianly brutes” do. And these mind, are their only
     pleasures.</p>
    <p>J.L. tells of swell asking what the new scent was at the Volunteer Ball. “Ah, believe it’s
     Esprit de corps,” returned another. M.L. tells of man dreaming he saw 8 &amp; 8 on each cheek
     of his wife’s – so asked for 88 Lottery ticket, but forgot the “0” in the middle — prize 808.
     Also of man giving toast to actress – “Place from which we came” And here’s the messenger who
     would fetch us, said she. “Something else to offer him besides an aperture in her person” says
     P.L. apropos of a rich wife. </p>
    <p>Braggart calling himself a Prince – Well, said somebody, he’s not far out, b’lieve his mother
     had a sovereign when she begat him. After these inanities we drink Bon Voyage to Horace who
     goes to Nova Scotia tomorrow (weeps at parting says S.B. next week) and also to Lucas, who goes
     to Vienna – setting me down tho’ at the Opera first, where I see Borghi Mario in Otello and

    <p>S.B. gives motto for a bad wine merchant – Trinculo. “I’ll give him to drink of this bottle,
     And if he have not tasted wine before he’ll say its good stuff” – or something to that effect.
     S.B. has a marvellous memory, which is more than H.S. has. H.S. moreover has a beastly cold,
     and is sore as to his eyes, and it’s as much as he can do to enjoy whitebait and mock-turtle,
     turbot and champagne, without trying to remember Shakespeare quotations. </p>
    <p>Apropos of the Shakespeare birthday dinners (S.B. presiding at Our Club on [crossed out:
     “Friday”] Saturday and Billy Russell at the Albion on Monday – and sending over to Thackeray
     for a Shakespeare and nearly going to sleep and taking his Bible instead). M.L. gets up and
     spouts à la after dinner swell – proposing the health of Mr. Evans as the publisher of Kean’s
     Edition. Not bad. Talk about Shakespeare. Some one contends that the world would not have been
     what it is, but for him. S.B. says Bosh, people would have quoted Ben Jonson. English writers
     quote nobody but Shakespeare (except Douglas Jerrold says Mark), for the reason that Sh. is so
     intensely quotable. Moliere is much quoted in France – but not so extensively, not so
     exclusively. Queen Eliz. R., Evans thinks, also greatly influenced posterity. </p>

      <p> Henry John Hatch (1818-1895) had been convicted for indecent assault against 11-year-old
       Mary Eugenia Plummer, a pupil, and sentenced to four years at hard labour in Newgate Prison.
       His supporters circulated evidence that had not appeared at trial, and persuaded eleven of
       the twelve jurors to sign a declaration that they would not have convicted him had they been
       shown this evidence. The Home Secretary agreed to consider a petition for his release if an
       action for perjury could be brought; supporters raised funds for such a suit, and the Plummer
       girl went on trial on May 15, 1860. After five days she was convicted and sentenced to three
       weeks imprisonment to be followed by placement in reformatory school, or in the care of a
       suitable governess. Hatch was released and later received a pardon. Press coverage was

     truly it is an untruth to paint accessories so that they become the prominent features. C.K.
     denies this. Says you should paint truly what you can and not sacrifice for the sake of

       Pattie (1834-1880), at this time the leading actress for comedy and burlesque at the Strand
       Theatre. In 1866 she became the manager of the New Royalty Theatre, where she produced such

     trading on the dearest affections of one’s nature is detestable. Parents put en rapport with

     gentlemen. English far better drest and behaved, as a rule. J.L. chuckles, Wisdom has been
     crying that in the streets these dozen years. Nobody like the English. Then T.T. tells of
     Englishman calling landlord an ugly beggar to his face, not thinking he knew English—and next
     day dined out and was introduced to landlord who spoke English perfectly. Also of Englishman at
     roulette, “I can’t play while that old hag sits opposite,” and the Russian lady makes a most
     polite response in perfect English also. These are the exceptions which prove the rule, of
     course. J.L. applauds T.T.’s article hereanent, and C.K. says “G.U.” of the <title>Times

    <p>T.T.’s little boy kept sitting up to welcome him (speaks German) – only laughed, and there
     T.T. saw a likeness to himself. Curious, that story of his being in bath and boy taking hold
     and saying KoK. Grim[?], says Thackeray. </p>
    <p>Talk on marriage. T.T. says its an art to live with your wife happily. Have your own way and
     let her have hers, says J.L. Give and take. P.L. says men of intellect had best not marry,
     happier single. All dissent from him. Pater says no man knows complete happiness without
     marrying. P.L. says wife apt to retrench in claret and not in crinoline. No, No, says Pater,
     and S.B. says wife would say beer didn’t agree with her, so that husband might afford himself
     an extra glass. J.L. pities the wife of a “talented” party, and thinks she has far the better
     sense and judgment. S.B. and T.T. both say their purses better managed now they’re womanaged. </p>

     himself for taking pleasure in it. J.L. tells of his intruding at Wingrove Cooke’s dinner and
     meeting his foe, Forster, and M.L. tells of his intrusion at dinner, given to Dickens, when

     Ryder is more wondrous still – you may speak of Mr. Fechter’s Iago. </p>

    <p>Rubens’ landscapes and animals his best work (T.T.). S.B. says no painter has produced a

       following year she married artist John Everett Millais, by whom she had eight
      children.</p></note> When T.T. goes, J.L. says the Art criticism in <title>The Times</title>
     too learned – S.B. says a man needn’t paint to criticise painting. J.L., C.K., and J.T. differ
     from him – say Ruskin can draw well. S.B. says he can criticize music and yet knows nothing of
     it – quotes a bit of his – “Over the deep abyss of bass there floated a silvery cloud of
     treble” etc.(Call <hi rend="underline">that</hi> criticism! bosh!). T.T. would write a
     criticism on Chaldee if he were asked – S.B. ranks a caricaturist like HB or Hogarth or J.L.

      <p> The widely reported Yelverton case of 1861 involved the secret marriage by Catholic priest

     H.S. doubts the efficacy of deathbed repentances, or rather that a fortnight is enough for them

      <p> Edmund Yates (1831-1894), literary journalist and later editor of the
       <title>World</title>, was expelled from the Garrick Club at the insistence of Thackeray,
       though supported by Dickens; this led to an estrangement between Dickens and Thackeray that
       lasted until shortly before the latter's death. See the account of “the Garrick Club affair”

       92-109. After Yates's derogatory article about Thackeray had appeared in the fugutive
       publication <title>Town Talk</title>, Thackeray wrote to him in protest. Yates took
       Thackeray’s letter to Dickens, showing him also a long, self-justifying reply he had written
       in which he castigated Thackeray for making fun of public personalities in his
        <title>Punch</title> parodies of the 1840s. Dickens found the letter “too flippant and too
       violent,” and helped Yates write instead a cold reply claiming that as Thackeray’s letter had
       itself been “slanderous and untrue” he could not apologize, and had nothing further to add.
       Thackeray later learned of Dickens's role from Dickens himself. Yates's letter of 15 June

     your reputation for his? “Yes.”“I don’t believe you.”Thinks “Lotos Eaters” T[ennyson]’s best.
     P.L. thinks Tennyson is to Wordsworth what Mendelssohn is to Beethoven: graceful but not
     sublime. Ranks “Laodamia” first of Wordsworth’s works. Beats Tennyson there on his own ground.
     — All 3 praise Scott. S.B. and P.L. the most – stirs the blood – but, says Thackeray, I don’t
     want to have my blood stirred. Like a trumpet call, says S.B. – and if his lines are here and
     there a little rough and hasty, who cares for good grammar when a hero cries out Up and at ‘em!
     Bulwer might much improve Scott’s language. Curious felicity of words, says Thackeray. Curiosa
     felicitas, appends S.B. (Thackeray often talks just as he writes. And I fancy so did Douglas

     uneasy” says J.L. Who gives good name for the O’Donoghue, the O’Dono-Yahoo. Clubs call him the
     O’Doodledoo. Thackeray says he’s a mild spoken young man, wants to make himself a somebody, and
     so takes the road to a dirty reputation. “Expectaroon,” Thackeray calls The Octoroon. J.L.
     hopes somebody will pitch into Boucicault’s “morality” and impudence – altering last act, and
     calling it “composed by the public and edited by Mr. B[oucicault].” Would have done cut of
     Swell, “Aw – do you dance this waltz – aw – then I’ll take your chair,” but M.L. has seen it
     somewhere. Du M. didn’t tell me he’d told M.L. of it. “Cut off your little enjoyments,” says
     B., which of course W.M.T. twists into a meaning. J.L. coaling the Waits from his bedroom.

     Yes, says J.L., leave it to the printers and they’re sure to put their foot in it. — T.T. reads
     poem by a young imitator of young Bulwer, Swinburn [sic]. First line proves it wouldn’t do for
      <title>Punch</title> or <title>Cornhill</title>: “I’m not quite right in my innards, Bill.”
     Several good lines and mixture of highpressure poetry and prosiest commonplace, as in the
     original: “Is there comfort in Holloway, Bill, and is there consolement in Parr?” – “What’s a
     poet? a bubble, a toy, a butterfly” etc. etc.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn196" n="195">
      <p> Algernon Charles Swinburne's “Last Words of a Seventh-Rate Poet,” which begins, “Bill, I
       feel far from quite right—if not further: already the pill / Seems, if I may say so, to
       bubble inside me,” was a parody of Owen Meredith's “Last Words of a Sensitive Second-Rate
       Poet.” The latter poem had appeared (under the title, “Last Words”) in the <ref target="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044011660966&amp;seq=583"><title>Cornhill</title> for November, 1860 [(vol. 2, no. 11), 513-517]</ref>. Swinburne's
       poem did not appear in print until his <title>Heptalogia</title> of 1880. It seems likely
       from this passage that he, or someone acting on his behalf, had given Taylor a manuscript
       copy, perhaps as a possible submission for publication in <title>Punch.</title> A manuscript
       of the poem (entitled, “A Poet's Last Words. By O.M.”) was noted by T. J. Wise in his
       bibliography of Swinburne, and dated by him as 1861; my thanks to Terry Meyers for this

    <p>Dickens made £l0000 by his readings last year. Thackeray cleared about ½ that altogether. —

    <p>Prince Albert’s death (on Saturday night at 11) the first topic. General regret.<hi rend="bold">X</hi> People now begin to feel how much he has had to do and bear. No easy thing
     to be a Queen’s husband. And wherein can we find fault with him? Negative virtues are
     commendable in princes. ‘Tis difficult in high places to abstain from committing oneself.
     Perched on a pinnacle, one’s least fault is observable. – They say Lord Palmerston has felt the
     sudden loss deeply. And, says T.T., they who had to do with the Prince all speak well of him.
     If he was fond of money, as some hint, surely his error was on the right side – seeing what
     precedents of extravagance he had before him. If the patronage of princes be a good thing for
     art, the nation should give them a purse adequate. It is a disgrace to a people that its rulers
     should be poor. The Queen is the first Sovereign who has kept out of debt, and confined herself
     to her Income. – Still the <title> Times</title> was surely wrong in saying the Prince’s loss
     was the <hi rend="underline">greatest</hi>calamity that could befall us. The Queen’s death
     would have been greater, or if not (and that is possible) it was hardly loyal to deny it. –
     J.L. says the Yankees will call our national grief the “Almighty Dolour.” – Neither N nor Ph –

       proprietor of the paper, John Walter III, and its editor, John Thadeus Delane. In later life
       he published a widely admired reminiscence about the Tractarian movement at Oxford with which

    <p>Apropos de something, P.L. says, “3 shits in the wind” – and S.B. adds, “Dejeuner à la 4

     D.J. they report how he snubbed Arcedeckne for talking about Shakespeare, “ass kicking dead
     lion with a silver hoof.” And S.B. quotes his saying to someone who was boasting how a Countess
     said, “Come in,” to him, – “Perhaps she took you for the waiter.” Whereat says J.T., “Why, I
     said that. The only joke I ever made.” D.J. always talking, Gil á Beckett chiefly silent: Fancy
     his widow marrying George Jones! Who’s G.J.? Jones of the Foreign Destitute, or the boy Jones,

      <p> Mary Anne à Beckett, widow of Gilbert Abbott à Beckett, married George Jones on February
       15, 1862 at the Holy Trinity Church, Brompton. According to the gossip recorded in the entry
       for August 12, 1863, the couple soon separated. A mysterious and flamboyant figure, George
       Jones had been mercilessly satirized by Thackeray and Jerrold twenty years earlier, along
       with his patron, James Silk Buckingham, and the British and Foreign Institute with which they
       were both associated. See Richard Altick, <title>Punch: The Lively Youth of a British

    <p>E. briefly proposes, “Success to <title>Punch</title>.” – 21 years ago tomorrow was his
     start. At more length and with good taste and feeling, E. then proposes health to Mark Lemon –
     dwelling on his constancy and attention to the interests of <title>Punch</title> and on his
     talent in raising it to its present standing. <title>Punch</title> met with obloquy in its
     start, as its printer and engraver were those of “The Town” and other ribald comic papers.
     Ribaldry and dirt were inseparable from comicality until <title>Punch</title> came. No light
     honour to a man to have kept such a team together as the <title>Punch</title> lot – to have so
     kindly borne and forborne, and reconciled and bound together men of such diversity of talent
     and of tastes. – M.L. in reply says he is the only survivor at this table of the original
      <title>Punch</title> lot: The Punch Club, as they first called themselves. M.L., Henry Mayhew
     and Stirling Coyne and Landells, the Engraver were the originators and proprietors. Jerrold and
     Á Beckett came in the second number — Leech in the 3rd or 4th (and the circulation dropped off
     one half by the day’s delay of his first cut – thro’ fault of Landells the engraver). Leigh
     joined a little later – and Ponny Mayhew before the 1st volume was ended. Albert Smith was one
     of the first number team — so was Beaton! A.S. constantly had rows with Jerrold – contending
     that <title>Punch</title> ought to stick to fun, and never be serious. M.L. and Henry Mayhew
     did the notices to correspondents — Jerrold’s “Q” papers had a marked success and influence,
     and his “Caudle [Lectures]” decidedly raised the circulation. The first meetings were held in
     Vinegar Yard — and rows were generally the order of the night. At first they dined on Saturday
     and then settled the cut for the next Saturday (Saturday was the publishing day). The new
     number used at one time to be handed round at the meeting and endless squabbles arose therefrom
     — every writer finding fault with every article inserted in preference to his own. Now all
     works smoothly —the machinery is kept oiled by good feeling and good humour – and long may the

     at first, and only got a guinea or so – and wrote a farce for the Strand called “Punch” —
     (revived since as “The Star of the Street”) and then another piece for £30 to carry on the
     paper. D.J. and Gil. à B. received 30/- a week. B. &amp; E. bought it at end of first volume
     after the Almanack (which was chiefly Grattan’s work) for £300, its debts. And gave M.L. £5 a
     week after a while to edit it. M.L. refused insertion of an article puffing some railway
     B[radbury] was interested in, and an article of Fonblanque’s which he thought libellous. Since
     that row, never has had another. His system is to let each man write what he likes, subject to
     M.L.’s supervision. “All cleverer fellows than I am,” says he — but is not his judicious
     editing a talent they can’t show an equal to? </p>

    <p>We drink the health of Mrs. Tom Evans and her baby – a 7 months child. J.L. relates how 9
     years ago he and Millais in their hunting boots had to run off for the doctor and nurse for
     Miss Ada – whose birthday party next Wednesday induces dinner on Tuesday. And thus do small
     people disturb the national affairs.</p>
    <p>J.L. tells how his boy was bothered by his governess to remember the provinces of Ireland –
     and he, J.L., instructed him to say “Ulster, Munster and I Connaught tell the other.” M.L. last

     took him down with his pillowcase, wig and counterpane gown on to his drawing room and
     introduced “My Lord” and treated him to wine. Apropos of this, we jawed about flogging which,

     life will produce more happiness in this life to him who leads it than leading a sensual

     account of the Flood – which he says lives in the legends of the Chinese and other nations. It
     is a pity the Church of England don’t have the courage to avow that there are certain parts of
     Scripture which must be read cum grano. All thinking men agree on their belief in God and
     Christ – but creeds keep them at enmity. Tennyson wisely says “There is more good truth in <hi rend="underline">honest</hi> doubt, Believe me than in half the creeds” – but then there must
     be honest faith as well. St. Athanius never wrote the Athanasian Creed – that was written for a

     Excrescences and away would go Dissent, and the Church would be greatly fortified.</p>

    <p>E., J.L., H.S., J.T., M.L., P.L., T.T.</p>
    <p>Of course our talk is of the Royal Wedding. London won’t recover from its loyalty just yet.
     Everybody has gone mad about the Marriage. Valetry of Valetries, all is Valetry, says P.L. And
     cynically talks about the tendency of people now to gregarious rejoicing over trivial affairs –
     today we marry, tomorrow comes the smallpox maybe. – Ergo be miserable always, say we all. Men
     who have had most sorrow are generally the first properly to rejoice says T.T. – life has heavy
     sorrows so be happy when ye may. T.T. in the Chapel yesterday {as were the Reeds and Jenny Lind
     and big Bowley and Clark, Mark’s man, as drawer of the curtains: Temple and E. in the
     Courtyard, and H.S. like a muff at the Crystal Palace where there was kiss in the ring and such
     like dreary festivities – moreover a beastly fog in Bessborough Street that morning and a jam
     on London Bridge enough to tear one’s coat off. In the streets people wandering purposelessly
     about and altogether very melancholy merriment. Somehow I never thought of the possibility of
     entry – but to the bold all things are possible.} A fine sight that throng of rich colours and
     jewels, and that once fleecy cloud of white in the midst. T.T. tells how the old dowagers
     emerged from their queer coverings like fairies out of witches. Bridesmaids not pretty he says.
     Noticed the gleam of sunshine on the Royal pew as the Queen entered. – The one black spot.
     Something selfish in such sorrow surely. Rumour says she wished the Chapel hung with black and
     that the Prince said “Then I’d better bring my Bride in a hearse.” T.T. says Pam looked like an
     old ape – very flattering to us Pam admirers. Agrees with us that the beauty of Alexandra is
     not merely in her features – looks good and amiable and wishing to please, and as if she had
     brains and used them. From the photographs one fancied her dark-haired – but Saturday’s sight
     of her dispelled this notion. I shan’t soon forget the glimpse of that fair face, bowing
     incessantly so that nearly everyone believed himself personally bowed to. What a sea of waving
     handkerchiefs and hats and hands she was borne along upon! I’d no idea the British populace had
     so many white handkerchiefs. They seemed almost to lift the carriage from its wheels and some
     of their handkerchiefs must almost have been flapped into her face. Wondrous to see that mass
     that filled all Fleet Street jammed against the houses when divided by the troopers, coming six
     abreast at last, and how the tide came flap together again when the wedge had passed. </p>
    <p>I was between the Misses Lemon with Mrs. Leech at the corner and Mrs. Sothern next behind her
     and her husband, Lord Dundreary by my side and Shenton pulling the string that made Punch bow
     his greeting – funny to see the fat old Aldermen and stiff military swells all gradually burst
     into a broad grin as they passed. And, touched by her mother’s elbow, how smilingly the
     Princess herself looked up at Punch and what a good view of her the Punchites so obtained.
     Somewhat of a cross between a beadle and a ballet girl was Mr. Punch, crowned with white roses
     and well covered with white favours ... I had walked twice to the Mansionhouse that morning,
     and taken a sight at London Bridge, too — where the pageant must have had a smack of old Rome
     about it – and along Cheapside, festooned with flags and with every window full and every
     housetop fringed with faces. And I’d passed through St. Paul’s churchyard by the galleries, 20
     deep, where Du Maurier and Grove and George Grimwood[?] and some 15,000 others sat. And so to
     Fleet Street with its charity children of St. Bride’s perched up by the Church and eating buns
     and singing psalms as if the gingerbeer had got into their heads. And after all was over and
     the champagne and 120 dozen oysters were consumed, and I’d chatted with Bob Orridge and his
     wife and Mrs. Charley Dickens in a splendid Indian mantle which made Fanny’s mouth water, and
     had been introduced to Burnand and Shirley Brooks’ wife’s cousin, a jolly looking fellow from
     Glasgow, and had given Master Reginald and his brother a jump – I went to Shine St. for
     umbrellas, and away we 4 trudged home through the slush to Bessborough Street, where were Joe
     and Wm. who had dined at Kingston to get out of the mob. – So did Leech and Tenniel go
     a-hunting down at Baldock and said the old master, “You show good taste.” To Lewis’s that night
     — where every artist was in raptures with the Princess and her beauty. And wherever each had
     stood every one seemed satisfied and to have enjoyed the sight. </p>
    <p>To return to Tuesday — T.T. tells how the Eton boys charged through the Police – and how Lady
     Pam wandered carriageless about till T.T. and another came to her relief. Strange to see the
     diamonded duchesses sitting in 3rd class carriages! – But the Illumination sufferings were
     worse. Ben Head on a bus from 7 o’clock till 4, via back slums to London Bridge and home by
     Lambeth where all the gas was out. Sterry[?] for 5 hours trying to get from Camberwell over
     Westminster Bridge — while Miss Loughborough and I followed in the wake of Fanny and the Old
     Un, with T. and E. at our heels and saw Bond Street and Poole’s and Regent Street and Charing
     Cross and so home by 11:30 by the Horseguards and Treasury, which was best of all. Plastered
     with white mud we were, but uncrushed and safe — the only bad squeeze being at the bottom of
     Bond Street, where we were borne out into Picadilly again by a down coming rush. A cold rain
     and hail fell just at five and made the slush. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn273" n="272">

       called <ref target="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008696602?type%5B%5D=all&amp;lookfor%5B%5D=town%20talk&amp;ft="><title>Town Talk</title></ref>, whereupon Thackeray engineered Yates's expulsion from the
       Garrick for conduct unbecoming a gentleman. Dickens acted as Yates's supporter throughout,
       causing an estrangement between the two novelists. For the most extensive recent treatment of
       the Garrick Club Affair, and its connections to the Dickens scandal, see Leary, <title>Punch
        Brotherhood</title>, 92-99. The allusion here to Yates's description of Thackeray’s broken
       nose, about which the novelist was known to be sensitive, appears to have become a
       commonplace shorthand for Yates’s offense even among Thackeray’s champions. One of them,
       James Hannay, in the course of a flippant attack on Yates in the <title>Pall Mall
        Gazette</title> in 1865, reminded readers that he had been thrown out of a club “for writing
       an article on a gentleman’s nose” (Edwards, <title>Dickens’s Young Men</title>, 113), while
       the short-lived <title>Arrow</title> reviled Yates for having made “facial blemishes a theme
       for public tattle” (6 August 1864, p. 11). In his memoirs, F. C. Burnand gives a vivid
       account of Thackeray’s angry reaction at this meeting (“Down came Thackeray’s fist like a
       sledge-hammer on the arm of the chair,” etc.); <ref target="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark:/13960/t4hm5b81v&amp;seq=305"><title>Records and Reminiscences</title> (London: Methuen, 1903; 1905), p.

       “smart young men” is Halliday’s (591). (See also the comments at the previous week's dinner,
       November 4.) Brooks, who by then had made up his quarrel with Sala, nevertheless declined an
       invitation to chair the dinner welcoming him back home from New York, perhaps for the reason
       Lemon mentions here. He suggested that Yates be asked, but, as this entry shows, Horace

     yearning wail over the child is one of the things that stick in one’s memory, when a rotten
     play like <title>Leah</title> is forgotten. Her line “And you believed that I had taken it” was
     the first thing that moved me: the scorn that her lover should believe she had been bribed to
     leave him. The piece itself is insufferably weak – except in one or two stage situations. But

     chaffs M.L. about his mistake in “Wait for the End” – making term time at Cambridge in
     September. Mark says a Cambridge man “read” for him and passed the error ... Afterwards when
     M.L., J. T., and H.S. alone, he says he “didn’t write for men like Thackeray” — believed he
     could tell a <hi rend="underline">story</hi> – didn’t aim at highflown sentiment or language.
     H.S. applauds this good feeling in the book ... Says he sketched plot – thought first of a
     catastrophe and then thinks what would lead up to it: Wrote the book a chapter a day, 38 in
     all, 2 days a week. Says Pater offered him a price so tempting that in justice to his children
     he was forced to write. “Weaver” of course is Webster – and “Stella,” Mrs. Mellon. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn304" n="303">
      <p> Ben Webster (1797-1882), actor-manager; Sarah Jane Mellon (1824-1909), née Woolgar,
       actress, joined Webster’s company at the Adelphi in 1858.</p></note>I fancied her Mrs.
     Stirling, and so did Tenniel. Says Mrs. M. used often to come to him and say “I think so and so
     should have these lines to say – they’ll be more effective so, than if I say them.” Never knew
     any other actor to do this. “Rupert Melville” he meant for Edmund Kean, who used to attend The
     “Harp” by Drury Lane, and stand 20 glasses of grog to poorer actors, many of whom drank
     themselves to death. M.L. used to get £200 for the <title>Illustrated</title> [<title>London
      News</title>] Xmas Supplement. They became jealous of his influence when Ingram died, and so
     have declined his service – and he’s too proud to resent it, as Mrs. Ingram, his friend, would
     do. </p>
    <p>L.C. Queen sending toys to Children’s Hospital, says W.M.T. – pretty picture – but not big
     enough for Large Cut – .. The Congress still the subject, says M.L. Thackeray suggests the Pope
     and Sultan coming to door, togged out, and Louis N[apoleon] as footman saying “There’s no party
     tonight, gentlemen – it’s put off.” H.S. suggests, Opening the Answernotes – Empress says, “The
     Bulls can’t come”Oh, then, says Emperor [Louis Napoleon], we must postpone the party ... H.S.
     as usual speaks sotto voce and C.K. gets the credit of “the Bulls.” [ <ref target="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.319510019145557&amp;seq=253"><title>Punch</title>, 45 (12 December 1863): 239, “Unavoidably Postponed”</ref>] Thackeray

     looked as tough and wiry – short stubbly iron grey hair, don’t you remember? – as he did 30

      <p> Samuel Wright, bricklayer, was executed January 12, 1864, for the murder of his lover,
       Maria Green, in the middle of the night after she had awakened and, according to his account,
       attacked him. It was widely felt that his execution was a miscarriage of justice, the result
       of his not having had legal counsel prior to entering a plea. The genteel and well-connected
       George Victor Townley, convicted of stabbing Elizabeth Caroline Goodwin to death after she
       broke off their engagement, had his death sentence commuted to life imprisonment after
       questions were raised about his sanity. This commutation, particularly in contrast to
       Wright's execution, inflamed public opinion, as Townley had never shown any evidence of
       insanity prior to the murder. Denied confinement in an asylum, he committed suicide in
       Pentonville in February, 1865 by leaping from a balustrade on the way out of chapel, onto a
       stone floor twenty-three feet below. The Townley case was widely discussed in the

      <p> Actor Walter Lacy (1809-1898), known for light comedy, was part of Charles Kean’s company

    <p>Anecdotes of Jerrold: Saying to Mrs. Frank Mathews, pouring tea out of a long spout “You do
     it like a man.” Lady says “Blank is too fickle to marry Miss – he has been on and off ever so
     many times.” “Ah,” says J., then depend he’ll never marry her.” </p>
    <p>Burnand – Man tired and sweaty, “I’ll sleep like a top.” “Yes,” says friend, “and smell like
     a bottom.” </p>
    <p>Talking of Rowland Hill, Shirley says in the next century perhaps there’ll be no letters
     written – all correspondence done by telegraph. Leech pictures a Swell saying, “Aw, I nevah
     write a letter – such a baw writing – I send a telegwam!”—Also pictures Man sending a message
     to his sweetheart, “Dearest, I love and adore you” etc., etc., and pretty telegraph clerkess
     saying “There’s a word or two too much, Sir. Perhaps you’d better strike out the “adore”?” Mark
     suggests the substitution of a \ for “marry” to save a word in a message, “I love you and am
     ready to marry you.”— Leech tells of Swell saying, “My intentions are Honourable I asshaw you
     except of course I can’t mawwy you, you know.” </p>
    <p>Sir Rowland Hill’s retirement the subject, says Mark – S.B. suggests, “The Modern
     Cadmus”—motto, “He gave us Letters,” Or why not reproduce the original Penny Envelope, and
     direct it as a letter of introduction to Posterity.” Leech says he parodied this design of
     Mulready’s and got only £5 for it – putting as a motto, “Mulled already.” “A man of the right
     Stamp” and “a man of Letters” rejected as mere puns. “Don’t see why one should be so serious,”
     says Keene. “Must be graceful, or don’t do it,” M.L. “I am the Eldest Son of good Sir Rowland,”
     S.B. — “Sir Rowland ‘ill” would represent the real facts, says Leech, make him resting, worn
     out – “Ease after Letters,” says Ponny, quoting Holywell St., etc. Britannia patting her prize
     man of Letters, M.L. – “A First Class man in Litterae Humaniores” says Ponny. – Shirley insists
     that Hill has done more to civilize England than half a dozen Shakespeares. No poor person ever
     wrote to another till the penny post came. Suggests Hill reclining asleep, and dreaming of the
     good effects of his work. “Pity he’s not dead,” says Charles Keene – “I mean for the artist’s
     sake.” Leech suggests Hill smoking and the pictures of his work seen in the fumes. – “How am I
     to draw Posterity” says Tenniel. ... Charles says, “But if Hill hadn’t invented it, somebody
     else would.” – “Then we’d better have a Monument to Somebody Else,” says Burnand. Shirley
     suggests Hill and Cromwell as two great Reformers – One cut off a bad King’s head, the other
     stuck on a good Queen’s head. – But his dream idea is decided on [ <ref target="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.319510019145557&amp;seq=413"><title>Punch</title>, 46 (19 March 1864): 117, “Sir Rowland le Grand” </ref>]. And Leigh is

     Britannia and saying, “Take care of him.” M.L. adds some thing about Garibaldi’s lame foot,
     “You’ll soon be able to wear the (Italy) Boot yet, if you keep quiet a bit.” P.L. suggests
     Garibaldi presented by Punch with the Freedom of his Office – which E. interprets to mean
     simply putting him on the free list. J.L. rather sneers at G[aribaldi], and M.L. thinks him the
     greatest man of the age – so unselfish and bravehearted. But weak in head says Shirley: who
     suggests Punch rowing him ashore or receiving him on landing (à la William III) A Roman Triumph
     – Punch as Roman welcoming him – Evans adds “This is the Noblest Roman of them all” to which
     Leech would add, “Next to me.” Civis Romanus sum. Pam receiving him also suggested: but the

       Stone up for today. There had been a set against him, touching certain alleged misusage of
       his mother, but 3 men said that they had made enquiries, and were satisfied, so he came in

     not spoiled by success, as too many clever fellows get to be. He tells Tenniel and me a lot of
     stories of his hunting exploits – fancy Mark in pink! – how he was stuck upon a big horse that
     had never before been saddled, and was whisked over a hedge and gate before he knew it – how
     another day he fell under the horse and was dragged out, day before he was 21 – lay abed a
     month after that birthday, when he danced with crutches. My garters are blue – said a sister of
     a friend of his, who “went into the country” soon after – i.e. to the Regent’s Park – £100 the

     redivivus. E., J.L., H.S.,. C.K., F.E., J.T., M.L., P.L., F.C.B., H.M., W.B., T.T. [W.B.,
     Junior = W.B. now.]</p>
    <p>T.T. says the Real Cause of Garibaldi’s going is that his reception here stirs up the Mazzini
     men in Italy and embarrasses the Italian Government. Suggests Victor E[mmanuel] crying to
     Palmerston, “he’s setting my house on fire – for God’s sake put him out.” But that would
     represent him as a firebrand, says Horace. — T.T. says he was with William Cooper and other
     Government Swells Monday week to see the General enter, and compromised the Government by
     throwing tricoloured bouquets to him: “Red, emblem of the blood you’ve shed – white, of the
     purity of your patriotism – green, of the growing hope we have of your complete success in
     regenerating Italy.” Certainly I never saw such a scene of enthusiastic welcome as at the
     Crystal Palace on Saturday. Mario and Guiglini and Madle Vitali shouting out their chorus and
     stretching out their hands to “Nostro Salvator”; who after bowing gravely and smiling his
     thanks, at length slowly clapped his hands to recognize his welcomers. (The only drizzling day
     since he came. We have been having summer Sunshine without interruption.) </p>
    <p>F.C.B. as Roman Catholic of course doesn’t applaud him – thinks Jerry Bawldi is becoming a
     Bore, glad he’s going – as I dare say are the Tories in their hearts tho’ they daren’t say so.
     Really ridiculous how they try to fasten on the Government some blame for his departure – I
     believe his health really <hi rend="underline">is</hi> the cause of it. No one could go through
     the Programme before him without having his head turned or at least his hand shaken off. It’s a
     wondrous fact this welcoming a man alike by Lords and Labourers for the mere reason of his
     fight for Liberty and his honesty and purity when he had gained his triumph. Garibaldi has
     nothing to give us but his friendship – yet how we all love him and like to do him homage. In
     this age of selfseeking scrambles after power and purseworship, it is certainly a grand thing
     to see a nation for once forget them both, and do honour to poor Honesty. </p>
    <p>L.C. The Conference meets today (and adjourns till Monday) and as Shakespeare is now
     uppermost we must have a Shakespeare cut about it. (By the way, we all give kudos to Tenniel
     for his Shakespeare Number Picture – which is put on the table. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn342" n="341">

    <p>A note from Shirley to say that on Friday he is 49! “and so Pater must let you have some of
     what he calls champagne.” – Says he’s full of morphia and misery – I think I’d rather have my
     small indigestive headaches than have a triennial go of gout.</p>
    <p>Leech very wroth with Evans for altering the wrapper from “Mr. Romford’s Hounds” to “Mr.
     Facey Romford’s Hounds” as it is on titlepage.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn343" n="342">
      <p> Leech had been the illustrator for four of Robert Surtees’s comic novels, <title>Mr.
        Sponge’s Sporting Tour</title> (1853), <title>Handley Cross</title> (1854), <title>Ask
        Mama</title> (1858), and <title>Plain or Ringlets?</title> (1860), all published by Bradbury
       and Evans. As early as 1861 Surtees had been eager to secure Leech as illustrator for
        <title>Mr. Facey Romford’s Hounds,</title> but Leech’s other commitments caused a long
       delay, and Surtees died on March 16, 1864. Bradbury &amp; Evans published the book in twelve
       monthly parts between May 1864 and April 1865. After Leech’s death in October, the
       illustrations for parts eight through twelve were undertaken by Hablot K. Browne (“Phiz”).
       The “wrapper” is the folded, decoratively printed colored paper (in this instance reddish
       brown) enclosing each number.</p></note> Says he took the pains to trace the letters
     backwards so that there should be no mistake. Now from being a book fit for a drawing room it
     is fit only for a sporting public house. M.L. explains after J.L. has gone that Surtees (who’s
     dead) meant to draw a snob and so purposely used the word “Facey.” Who was that ex-groom who
     became a Master of a Pack where Dick Watson hunted? It’s this practice that Surtees wished to
     expose. We all agree that Leech is out of health and should take rest – but Mark thinks he
     wouldn’t give up his dinner engagements. To get into Society has been the aim of his life, and
     now he seems to have lost all taste for enjoyment. M.L. and P.L. both say it annoys him to
     think <title>Punch</title> could go on without him – even for a month. Curious pride this and
     yet quite natural. He has always been a spoilt child says Mark, lets petty worries master him,
     and it is sad to think that his great gifts have not made him a more happy man. … J.L. said he
     went to Charterhouse t’other day to see running matches, jumpings, and other athletic sports. A
     new thing this. </p>
    <p>L.C. S.B. suggests the Order of St. Gibbet for the King of Prussia – which is at once
     approved. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn344" n="343">
      <p> In capturing the Danish fort town of Dybböl, the Prussians had been guilty of atrocities

     it would take a man living in the country and having lots of leisure. </p>
    <p>Lucas married! “Done for himself” says Leech. Next week Pater says the marriage took place a
     dozen years ago and was concealed for fear of Lucas’ father, who is now dead. A wrong thing so
     to treat a wife. Of course her reputation suffers.</p>
    <p>Discussion as to whether the Bible should be castrated. M.L. and H.S. No. W.B. and Pater Yes
     –or, at least, they think such phrases as “He that pisseth against a wall” should be
     retranslated. Of course, “male” is what is meant. Certainly the age is more delicate in words
     than any former one we know of – but is it so in thoughts? For myself I like plain blunt Saxon
     names instead of foreign euphuisms, which are quite as nasty in their meaning tho’ thought
     nicer in their sound. A girl shrinks instinctively from the one, but sees no harm in the other.
     And so her mind becomes corrupted.</p>
    <p>M.L. applauds Cardwick for saying “God chose the Stage for his greatest genius
     (Shakespeare).” Why are authors jealous and artists not? asks M.L. Tenniel began Big Cut Friday

    <p>E., J.L., H.S., F.E., J.T., M.L., P.L., F.C.B., W.B., T.T.</p>
    <p>J.L. thinks Wilkie forced and unnatural – his Scotch Hindman’s buffer painted from a London
     drayman, his colour poor and his treatment niggling. J.T. and T.T. contra. J.L. says the Irish
     peasant among his master’s “Old Masters” is the most genuine picture in point of humour that
     has been seen since Hogarth. ... Glad to see old Landseer come out this year as he has done in
     the Squirrels (pair of Nutcrackers) and the Bears. </p>
    <p>T.T. says the “best heads in the Cabinet” (Pam, Russell, and (I think) Gladstone), were for
     sending a ship to the Adriatic and 10,000 men to the Daneswerk last Autumn and believes this
     would have prevented the fighting. Venetia is Austria’s fear of course and if Europe had blazed
     into War, we could not have been blamed for it. Thinks peace very doubtful. If England is to
     keep the position she must not stand aloof. So surely as the voice of the Tenpound Householder
     becomes the voice of the country, so surely will her downfall begin. ... M.L. and P.L. differ
     from this view – hold that we had no right to interfere. Yes, says T.T., we had – as party to
     the Treaty of ‘52, and it was a good opportunity to show that we dared to act alone – for the
     odds were neither Prussia nor Austria would have faced us.</p>
    <p>L.C. T.T. suggests French cat feigning to be asleep and British bulldog really so, “Let
     sleeping cats lie” – fable of the cat and mice – Austria and Prussia mice making a row. P.L.,
     Danish. Raven giving the Black Eagles a peck – apropos of the Danish Sea Victory – which the
     Austrian Admiral gets promoted for! </p>
    <p>M.L., Policeman Bull stopping the fight. T.T., Landseer’s 2 bears tearing the Treaty (flag)
     of 1852. J.L., The 2 Nutcrackers hard at it while John Bull sips his claret—or, Conference all
     asleep: “What is done by the Conference”—P.L. suggests Conference Bench of Magistrates and
     either he or Mark hit on the neat phrase “Remanded for a Month,” that being the period of
     Armistice: dating from tomorrow ... approved ... [<ref target="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.319510019145557&amp;seq=507"><title>Punch</title>, 46 (21 May 1864): 211, “Brutal Assault – Remanded for a Month”

    <p>J.L. thinks Bass’s Street Music Bill should be helped by a cut of the “Two Barrels” beer and
     organs. Or, organmen toiling uphill “Excelsior” – better say up a treadmill, says Burnand, who
     suggests “Removing the Grinder,” John Bull at the Dentist’s – organ extracted. “Oh that
     dreadful headache – ha!ha! cured in an instant.” <hi rend="underline">Basso</hi> relièvo: as
     Tom Hood called it. Sotto to M.L. and J.L., “I’ve just come from the Mill and so I know I’m
     clean.” T.T. says his little boy and his friend went out walking with 2 gentlemen and came home
     and said, Oh, Mamma – such fun – we’ve been drinking out of all the horsetroughs – they didn’t
     a bit take care of us!” </p>
    <p>J.L. tells of Millais’ eldest boy wrapping little brother up in a wet towel, “like Mamma does
     herself to cure him of a pain in his ’tomach.” – T.T.’s boy’s attempt at drawing a Bird of
     ‘Sparagus (Paradise). – Burnand imagines an after dinner lecturer talking thickly of the fate
     of our firsht parents who were casht out of ‘Sparagus! </p>

     France and Russia as much bound by the treaty of ‘52 as we are, but they’ll only fight for

     their increase. </p>
    <p>He also talks of Chatsworth and the “Twelve Apostles” – 12 big butts of beer.with the Royal

     June 15. He went to Hamburg the day following, and has been staying at Whitby since his return.

      <p> Shirley Brooks's diary entry for Monday, October 31, 1864: “I re-open the book with a
       heavy heart. Poor dear John Leech is no more. At the dinner on Wednesday he was present, but
       complained of illness and pain, and I saw that it was difficult to make him completely grasp
       the meaning of things that were said to him, without two or three repetitions. He left early,
       with T. Taylor. On this Saturday, I called at 27 Bouverie Street, and heard from Evans that
       he was very ill. We went off to the Terrace, Kensington. He was in bed but no one seemed
       frightened, and there was a child's party, a small one. Mrs. Leech was in tears, but
       certainly had no reason to apprehend the worst. He would have seen us - we remained 3/4 of an
       hour or so (his detestable father haranguing us on his own merits, I understand why, now) but
       an opiate had been given, so it was of course felt that he ought not to be disturbed.
       Arranged to meet Evans there at 3 next day. At 7 that night all was over… [Oct. 30] We went
       in, saw him, and Joyce, and the detestable father, and the poor mother, and two of the
       sisters. And afterwards to the chamber of death. He looked noble in his calm, the hair and
       whiskers put back, gave up his fine forehead and handsome features - and the eternal
       stillness gave his face an elevated expression. I looked a long time at my old friend's face.
       We have known one another many years, and he has been engaged with me in business as well as
       in pleasure. He was very kind - very good - and is in Heaven, whatever that means. I left
       Evans and called on [Eneas Sweetland] Dallas, that the <title>Times</title> might have a
       worthy notice. D. was out but I left word on a card, he came up at night, and I am glad to
       think that L's memory owes to me the prompt and graceful record that appeared next day. Very
       sad all the night.”</p>

      <p> Shirley Brooks notes of this meeting, in his diary entry for November 1, 1864: “To
       Bedford, where Mark L. had called a meeting of P.P. men, to consider what could be done to
       strengthen P.P. under the circumstances.</p>

      <p>indeed all but HM. There was little discussion, but all his proposals were received in a
       good spirit, and the agreements were -- </p>
      <p> Dinners to be more regularly attended</p>
      <p> Everyone to bring a list of topics he thinks worth note</p>
      <p> Copy to be earlier</p>
      <p> Stress was laid on necessity for smart and careful writing</p>
      <p> Dumaurier and Marks to be engaged if possible” (Houghton Library)</p></note></p>
    <p>M.L. thinks that Dinners have not been looked on as a part of the week’s work so much as they
     ought to be—begs for better attendance and for more business talk at them – thinks everyone
     should come with suggestions, both for articles and cuts. Hopes we will back him in protesting
     against the forwardness of young B&amp;E, which is offensive to him and injurious to the work.
     ... What artist shall be asked to join us? C.K. and J.T. both say Du Maurier and H.S. speaks
     for him as anxious to join us.... H.S. runs to No. 20 and back to dinner (cod and leg of mutton
     only). C.K. only leaving. ... Talk of the rehearsal of Tom Taylor’s Hidden Hand last night,
     which F.C.B. approves. T.T. says you can’t measure an actor by one part – Milter Moss was well
     drest and an eccentricity – but the man fails me now.—We laugh at Tom’s calling actor aside in
     quite a friendly way and saying, “My dear fellow, you must be a d – d fool to act so.”—Jerrold
     had a donkey he used to call George Hodder. M.L. tells how George used to complain, “Why
     Thackeray and Dickens get their £2,000 a year, and I only my £200 – can’t make it out” – and
     how Jerrold taught him to write a funny police report and on the strength of its success poor
     George applied for an increase of salary, and his letter crossed one giving him the sack. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn366" n="365">

     was found guilty on Saturday – and P.L. recites his Alibi Baby on the tree top, When the bolt
     falls the Müller will drop etc.</p>
    <p>May as well do the large cut, says T.T., and S.B. suggests contrast of the Irish Witch and
     the English Spiritualist – “Which is Witch?” says M.L. “No, Medium and ReMedium,” T.T. [ <ref target="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.319510019145557&amp;seq=769"><title>Punch</title>, 47 (12 November 1864): 199, “Medium and Re-Medium” </ref>].</p>
    <p>Then we revert to poor Leech – his voluntas was stronger than his arbitrium, says P.L. – he
     could deny no one, not excepting himself. M.L. narrates how he would start from a cut to walk
     up Oxford Street – and laments those dear old days when Leech first married and what a pleasant
     little unaffected wife he had and how delightful were the little homely banquets of mutton and
     gin and water to which she welcomed his friends. P.L. tells of the old father calling on him
     this morning and bowwowing about the article in the <title>Times</title> which implied that
     family money matters had injured Leech’s health. “You must write and contradict this, Mr.
     Leigh” “I shall be most happy to do so, Sir, if you will supply me with some facts on which I
     may refute the statement.” ... Old Leech was keeper of the London Coffee House. And M.L. says
     he knows that Leech accepted bills for the old man and his daughters for £3000 or so: which
     swept away the sum he received for his first 100 paintings. While J.L. was in Hamburg, the
     father called to borrow £50 of old Joyce and then of M.L., and hearing this made J.L. very
     indignant and angry, and M..L. seeing how agitated he was, said, “Your duty is to work for your
     wife and children, and not let your mind be harassed, and if buttoning up your pockets leads to
     a quarrel with your father, I still should advise you to button them up.” </p>

       taken by George du Maurier, and Mr. Silver tells me that, on his first appearance, he made
       the Staff a little uncomfortable by referring to his blindness. After complaining that people
       were for ever calling him “de Maurier,” and expressing the hope that
       the <title>Punch</title> men would give the devil his “du,” he went on to remind them that he
       was blind of one eye, and begged them to pardon him if he failed at any time to “ see” a
       subject that might be suggested for his pencil. “But,” said Shirley, “Tenniel has only one
       eye left, and it really is the left, for he lost his right while fencing, whilst you have
       your right eye left. So you see you two fellows have two good eyes between you, and a pair of
       good eyes are far better than a score of bad ones. In the country of the blind, you know, the

     their swords, “Abe (Ave) Lincoln, massa, morituri te saluto,” P.L. J.T. suggests the Swedish

     prize – got it with a box on the ear “presenting the freedom in a box” says Horace. Bravo
     Ponny. T.T., suggests the 2 black cats hung over a line fighting. But no, we stick to the

      <p> Brooks's entry for this meeting, 16 November, notes the same tensions to which Silver
       alludes in his note beginning the November 30 meeting: “ D. Punch Bedford. Previously a row
       touching the invitations, and the non-including young Bradbury. Evans came to Bedford about
       it. What damned hash all this is when the ship is in rough water and we are all working our
       best.” (Houghton Library)</p></note></p>
    <p>Mark inveighs against “the Beautiful Menken” as the blackguard, E.T. Smith, calls her. Shows
     a pamphlet that biographises her as having translated the Iliad at 12 years old and studied
     several languages besides becoming a graceful artist and an Editor of a newspaper—all this in
     addition to her having still further distinguished herself by marrying Jack Heenan who fought
     Tom Sayers.</p>
    <p>L.C. T.T. suggests the Manchester Sewage Question – the Sewage Machine, says H.S. But the
     Teetotal meeting at the Guildhall is more Punchy – Lord Mayor ’Ale, as the Haldermen doubtless
     call him, just the man to preside. P.L. suggests the Loving Tea cup [<ref target="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.32106014328360&amp;seq=231"><title>Punch</title>, 47 (26 November 1864): 219, “The Loving (Tea) Cup” </ref>], party of
     aldermen at the Tea Table: Why not Gog and Magog, says H.S. and repeats M.L. (a little louder)
     and so gets settled.</p>
    <p>M.L. starts a Book today to book the suggestions for Big Cuts etc. Looks tremendously
     businesslike. Used to scribble on a bit of notepaper. Elegant phrase that of Gibbon’s says
     Shirley, “Worshippers of the Venus Averta.” No rhyme to your name, is there, Silver? says he –
     and narrates how poor Thackeray delighted in selling you by saying, “I’ve written a little poem
     today ‘The mouse lay cozy in her hole and nothing could be snugger, – for the life of me I
     couldn’t find a rhyme to it.” Victim suggests something obvious and Thackeray says gravely,
     “Dear me, yes, of course, I never thought of that!” </p>
    <p>“Nemo repente fuit Tuppertimus,” says Percival ha! ha! good book that. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn373" n="372">
      <p> Per Constance Smith, this is a parody of Juvenal, “Nemo fuit repente turpissimus,”

     adds he, anent some case that deserves the pillory. Shirley suggests a line for for
     illustration about the Tiger (Buttons) mangling in his lair. Don’t you think proverbs might be
     illustrated, says D.M., (H.S. to Covent Garden with Wm. Watson to hear Maraniello.) </p>

    <p>Burnand breakfasts alone with his newspaper and his wife has hers in bed. Forbids children to

    <p>Talk of Burton's plan for exploring the North Pole, which Shirley approves. Shirley tells of
     Tom's coming to Garrick too late to fulfill his promise of backing Sullivan, the Composer. –
     “Pilled, is he? – ah – cold day, isn't it? What d'ye think of Fechter's Macaire?” <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn394" n="393">
      <p> Richard Francis Burton (1821-1890), African explorer. Despite this initial setback,
       composer Arthur Sullivan (1842-1900) was admitted to the Garrick and would be active in the
       club for the rest of his life. Charles Albert Fecther played the character of Robert Macaire
       in Adolphe Beau’s “The Roadside Inn” at the Lyceum when he presented the play there on
       January 21, 1865.</p></note></p>
    <p>S.B. would like a slice of Siberia for our convicts – sharp floggings instead of long
     imprisonments. No assaults on Queen since flogging was prescribed. P.L. says that as man
     develops his higher faculties, he loses taste for the exercise of his lower. Animals have an
     instinct that limits their breeding – man's reason should supply this. Shirley says, “But men
     don't reason in bed – poor people have two pleasures, to get children and to get drunk. Rich
     people have dinners, [word crossed out, “newspapers”?], horses, shooting boxes, sodomy and
     small talk – but these luxuries are not allowed to the poor. So you can't wonder at their
     having large families, tho' they have nothing to live on and know that half their sons must
     either steal or starve.” – An eloquent debate about this. </p>
    <p>Then Shirley sets a copy in small writing: “Professor Leigh is one of the most remarkable men
     of the day, whether we regard his extraordinary memory, his subtle ratiocination, his fluent

     wrote those in this week upon The Gladiators while travelling from Worcester. H.S. pencils also

     privilege of the Court. Keene tells of a game, “Hammer, chisel and block” – boy propelled, with
     head into block's stomach. </p>

    <p>A week of horrors. News of Lincoln's assassination last Wednesday and that of a Russian
     attaché in Paris. On Monday news that Admiral Fitzroy, the Clerk of the Weather, had cut his
     throat (with a cutting East Wind, says Shirley) – cause overwork: a warning to us fellows – and
     that Prescott the banker had cut his throat also. On horrors head etc. Next Tuesday, we hear
     that Booth is shot. Shirley protests against Tom Taylor's lines on Lincoln –
      “<title>Punch</title> has <hi rend="underline">not</hi> been blind and shallow,” and even if
     it had, we ought not to own it. “Would you have written the lines, Leigh?” – “I, no! I should
     think not, indeed.” Mark contends that the avowal that we have been a bit mistaken, is manly
     and just: and H.S. agrees with him. Our principal mistrust in Lincoln arose from his saying he
     would throw over the Slave question if he thereby could maintain the Union: and then afterwards
     declaring it was Slavery alone that caused the War and alone could finish it. But he was an
     honest man. </p>
    <p>L.C. A Budget Cut – apropos of last Thursday. Income Tax reduced to 4d and tea duty to 6d.
     Shirley suggests grocer making excuses to a lady why he can't reduce the price: amends this to

    <p>Shirley likes Miss Bateman's “Bianca,” but condemns the play. Tom has never seen anything to

    <p>Shirley pitches into Tom anent the Lincoln lines – and Tom says he felt his pen “lamed” by

    <p>L.C. Shirley suggests, apropos of Baines on Reform, the Working Man being photographed by
     various parties – one making him an angel and another a devil: Bob Lowe representing him as a

     different photos to his wife ... Tom also suggests Russell's Reform Bill parodying Landseer's
     horse in Prosperity and Adversity. Mark suggests Workman with a pot of beer on one side and a

    <p>He tells of the wit of a little French girl in 1848, “Laissez moi, papa” to a blackguard in a
     blouse – and then explaining to D.M. Senior, “Maintenant tous les messieurs sont mes papas. Et
     mème les messieurs en blouse.” Both he and Horace declare there's no nature in French children
     and no modesty in French girls, all shrinking as they pretend to be. Common thing for a French
     woman to let a young Englishman walk with her daughter, “I can trust you.” Fancy what a state
     of morals, when the play most fashionable now in Paris represents a wife as in love with her
     husband and regretting she is not in love with her lover. After she sins and is kicked off,
     says someone to the husband, “Will she return ever?” And the curtain falls on his “Peut être!”
     — ugh! the “filthy copulative beasts” as Mark calls them in his disgust. </p>

     the Emperor drest as a Mussulman apropos of his Algerian visit – and Shirley amends it to his

    <p>Last week we debated about suicide and Tenniel thinks that hope is a preventive: e.g. in
     apparently incurable disease a remedy may be invented. Evans says, Fear: and quotes Hamlet —and
     then Job The Lord hath given and the Lord hath taken away – blessed be the name of the Lord. Du
     Maurier says before he married he often felt tempted to suicide. And H.S. on a cliff's edge has
     felt a tingling about his stomach – a devilish impulse to jump over. But this is merely a
     disordered frame of mind arising from bodily infirmity, such as a blue pill and a black dose

     training. To call your father governor and old cock must somewhat lessen respect – and to aim
     at accomplishments and sneer at home housewifery does not improve a girl or make her fit for

     His Election bunkum manifesto is a splendid piece of impudence. </p>
    <p>Poor old Joyce died on Saturday. He fell down in a fit a few days before in Lincoln's Inn and
     never spoke again. Godfrey Evans tells me that his habit was to turn a handkerchief about to
     see if it were his and this he did in his unconsciousness on his deathbed. He was rough – but a
     goodhearted kind man. I believe he was a master and Bradbury his apprentice. The situations
     were reversed and B. became his master. </p>
    <p>Sam Lucas must be mad. He asked Tom Taylor where he cd get his – photographed. I thought his
     eyes looked black and wild at Leech's sale – where he introduced his wife to Ponny as the
     prettiest and most intellectual woman in the world. They say he was mad drunk at the Club on
     Saturday. Overwork, says Leigh. Disappointment that his wife is not noticed, says Pater. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn425" n="424">
      <p> On the same day, Brooks noted in his diary, “I hear that L[ucas] was wild at the club on
       Saturday. He looks ill.” Publisher William Tinsley, who had worked closely with Lucas, later
       recalled that about this time “some peculiar phases of poor Mr. Lucas's mind, which had for
       some time been visible, began to show themselves in a more serious form” (<ref target="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435053108502&amp;seq=352"><title>Random

        322</ref>. Lucas had also become estranged from Bradbury and Evans, writing increasoingly
       hostile letters beginning in December of 1864. On May 4, 1865, he wrote of his relationship
       with B&amp;E as “a connection which I shall ever regard with disgust, and which I do now
       unceasingly deplore.” The seven letters from Lucas to Bradbury are in the Beinecke Rare Book
       and Manuscript Library, Gen Mss. 210, Box 1, Folder 15.</p></note>

    <p>The talk gets very mournful – Leigh saying men now work too hard and don't spare time enough

     has a pension of £100 a year – and I get a letter from her confirming it. </p>
    <p>Then the talk gets anecdotical about Mrs. Wigan and Mrs. Glover and Duvernay[?]. But first we
     have an art jaw apropos of Sandys' drawing to Swinburne's poem in <title>The Shilling

       senior, at her home, “Wildwood,” a cottage near Hampstead. They married on April 29, 1865, in

    <p>Joyce's man, “Alfred” hanged himself yesterday after eating some toast and taking a cup of

      <p> In his diary entry for this date, Shirley Brooks wrote: “At Bouverie St. heard that
       ‘Alfred’ had yesterday hanged himself. This was a great, sturdy, humble creature, who packed
       admirably, and whom Joyce used to abuse and be kind to. He loved flowers too. He had a nice
       wife and 3 or 4 children. Some embezzlement, done by driblets, and amounting to some £4 had
       been detected, as he must have known it would be, and the clerk had told him that the firm
       must know it next day. He was depressed at night, but slept well, eat a good breakfast, and
       then went into the back kitchen, and, I dare say, tied a very safe and adroit knot. I think
       Joyce's death affected him, as a master's does a dog – and it is suggested that Joyce gave
       him much beer money, now missed. Poor old Alfred the Packer.” (Morgan Library) “Joyce” was
       Felix Joyce, B&amp;E’s manager.</p></note> How could a man breakfast so coolly with such a
     thought in his head? Shirley thinks a man may kill himself from curiosity – to know what the
     next world is like. D.M. and S.B. agree that when a man is a confirmed cripple and a bore to
     himself and everybody he is justified in suicide. F.C.B. and P.L. and J.T. and H.S. and E. and
     the rest contra. No right to do evil. Murder is taking human life – not simply a fellow
     creature's. A suicide is a murderer – and a coward. A man must be an atheist and a fool to kill
     himself. “The fool hath said” etc. How can he tell what good he may do if he keeps alive? What
     right has he to destroy life which God gives and God alone should take? Shirley says, “But God
     is too hospitable to turn away an uninvited guest.” </p>

     John Bull pointing to Sepoy blown from gun, “That's what you'll come to” – or saying to Mother

     Patrick seems a good notion. Fenian reptiles vanishing before him. Suggested last week, but the

      <p> Shirley Brooks's diary for this date gives the following account: “Whitefriars, and to the
       Albion, to a dinner given as a sort of inauguration of the new firm, and the introduction of
       the Agnews. It was what Bunsby would call a howling good dinner. All the staff, the 4 B.
       &amp; E.'s and 3 Agnews (not T. Taylor, who pleaded illness). I will set the array, as it may
       not be gathered again in a hurry. B. made a long speech, commending the sons to the
       friendship of the <title>Punch</title> men. Evans said that the history of B. &amp; E. had
       begun, continued, and ended in mistakes, but now all was to go right. M. L. spoke very well
       and with an intention that a non-interference policy must be adhered to. I proposed 'The
       Ladies,' and Horace replied. </p>

     and “Used Up,” (S.B. reporteth). </p>
    <p>B. on his legs – seems like old times. Has only dined once with us (last June) since 1862:
     and oddly enough D.M. was away that once. B. and E. getting old, have put their sons in their
     stead and taken the Agnews into partnership. So we drink success to B. E. &amp; Co. upstanding
     and with cheers which Mark leadeth. W.B. and Fred return thanks – and hope the new era will
     only follow out the old. (No cheques from Smith Payne of late — they pay in cash and bank at
     Manchester.) Then Mark feelingly proposes the health of B. &amp; E. who have weathered so many
     storms and brought their ship into harbour successfully at last. Mark has spoken plainly at
     times anent <title>Punch</title> to its proprietors, and intends to do so still. Men work well
     together, because they are liberally treated. Thought our loss last year would seriously have
     affected <title>Punch</title> — but it did not. And no single loss will. Feels proud of his 25
     years' old: thinks it has done good. B. endorses this and speaks to the brotherly affection
     between Mark and B. and E. Says if you want men to serve you well, treat them well, and win
     their sympathy and esteem (hear! from H.S.). — E. emphatic on the Brotherhood of
      <title>Punch</title> table. Says he and B. began by making mistakes – went on making mistakes,
     and have ended with mistakes. Nevertheless the acorn of their business is now a goodly oak.
     Hope the new firm will profit by the errors of the old. And avoid Daily Newses.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn452" n="451">

    <p>B. proposes the health of Mark who thanks us with tears in his eyes. Shirley: “Please fill
     your glasses, gentlemen. and when you have done so, I will continue the oration I have
     commenced.” ... So proposes the Health of “Nearest and Dearest”: Every man likes to have some
     one to care for and likes that somebody to be not of his own sex. ... Horace returns thanks
     humourously. regretting that a husband was not asked to do justice to the toast. ... Then B.
     goes and cigars come and D.M. sings “Je n'ai que vingt quat' sous”. And H.M. sings Thackeray's
     “Mahogany Tree.” And W.B. sings “Time is on the Wing.” And J.T. sings “The Spanish Ladies.” And
     M.L. sings “Cupid's Garden” And H.S. sings “Beautiful Kitty.” And C.K. sings “The 3 Ravens” and
     Bennett sings “Widow Machree.” And Burnand sings “The Whale,” improving funnily in this
     fashion: “O 'twas in the Northern seas Where the water it do freeze And the wind it very often
     blows a ga-ale, We rigged our good ship out And we sailed with hearts so stout All for to go
     and catch a whale Brave boys! All for to go and catch a whale ... We'd a captain and a mate Who
     roast pork for supper ate, He preferred a pig with curly tail, And we'd a little cabin boy who
     to his mother said “Ahoy, I'm going for to catch” etc.</p>
    <p>Then our captain says, says he Through my spyglass I can see A shoal of fish ahead There I'll
     go ba-ail: So bring your cutlasses/magazines and guns and shot Weighing hundreds of puns And we
     will go etc. And so forth and so forth, we supplying rhymes such as ale–pale, seakale – rail –
     snail etc. And imaginary shipmates down to the friend of the captain’s who happened to be on
     board.</p>
    <p>Then F.C.B. also singeth a song with no words to speak of to the tune of John Jones was a
     Farmer – Tolderol, lolderol, lolderol lay. Moral: “Now all you young fellows who're fond of
     flirtation Never go with a girl who is a ation, Or you'll find out too late she is given to
     negation. Folderol etc.” So we pass a jolly evening and bear in mind Pater's remark that
     sociality is the secret of the success of <title>Punch</title>.— Says he owes to his
      <title>Punch</title> friends some of the happiest days in his life. And so say we all of us... </p>
    <p>Mark saith, “My friend, Mr. William Agnew, agrees with me that the Sherry at Bouverie Street
     is beastly – so in future he will take care of that department. And Mr. Thomas Agnew will edit
     the cigars – so we may expect improvement therein.” Lustrum is five years, says Shirley. –
     Leave off the lust and take to the rum, Horace. .. Walk home and thereabout till 1 to avoid

      <p> Governor Edward John Eyre’s brutal repression of the Morant Bay rebellion in Jamaica in
       October 1865 polarized Britain’s ruling and literary elites. After a Royal Commission
       investigation, Eyre was removed from his post and recalled to Britain but the efforts of the
       Jamaica Committee led by John Stuart Mill failed to secure an indictment of Eyre for murder
       and abuse of power. There is an extensive scholarly literature about the case, but a good

    <p>Buckstone gave a ball on the Haymarket Stage last Thursday, at which, S.B. and his wife and
     H.M. and F.C.B. and Tom Reed and others danced. “Would you like to go?” said S.B. to D.M. last
     week – but D.M.'s dancing days are over – only cares for dinners now! Fancy the old fogydom of
     Thirty! And I love dancing still – at 37.</p>
    <p>H.M. saw Burnand's “Yachting Cruise” at the Gallery last night and thought it poor and
     wanting plot. Ah says S.B., “I told Burnand he little knew how hard it was to write ... for the
     Reeds. I was bored and bothered out of my life when I wrote for them. Only Parry can act. Mrs.
     Reed is passeé and limited in her parts, and her husband is an ass. It's the most difficult
     thing writing for such people and making anything like a connection between the characters. I'd
     rather write three five act comedies.” ... “I wish you'd write <hi rend="underline">one</hi>,”
     says H.S. </p>
    <p>S.B., “I dare say 3,000 people are at this moment listening to Burnand's talk. I don't care
     for puns and nigger breakdowns.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn484" n="483">
      <p> “Breakdown” glossed by Eric Partirdge as slang circa 1870 meaning “riotous
      dancing.”</p></note> In the old days we used to aim at something higher than mere verbal
     juggling. Burlesquing a situation, or a character is better than making puns. “An upright
     monarch and a downright fool” I remember told well…and my parody of The Duke's Court letters in
     'Robin Hood or Richmond'.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn485" n="484">
      <p> “Robin Hood or Richmond” appears to be a mistranscription for “Robin Hood and Richard
       Coeur de Lion, a Burlesque Spectacle in Two Acts” (1846), written by J. H. Stocqueler,
       Shirley Brooks, and Charles Lamb Kenney. In writing to George Somes Layard, Henry Silver,
       evidently consulting his diary notes, recalled these remarks of Brooks's this way: “One day
       at the <title>Punch</title> dinner-table, after the business of the evening was transacted,
       Shirley said, 'Good legs will carry off bad rhymes, and people chiefly go to look and not to
       listen. And so players don't take pains to say their words intelligibly, and instead of good
       burlesques we get bad puns and breakdown dances.' As a sample of stage-writing, he thought
       the verse 'An upright monarch and a downright fool' was rather a good line of his own, when
       rightly spoken. And he agreed with me in praising Mrs. Keeley for the clearness of her
        utterance.<hi rend="apple-converted-space"> </hi><ref target="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015030922754&amp;seq=218">Layard,

    <p>To Slough at 11. H.S. with W.B. just back from Manx- land, and P.L. and Tom Agnew who sticks
     up for Gladstone in resigning – “more than the Tories would do.” “Why should we not increase
     the House – and give new members to the new great towns? – P.L. says country don't want reform,
     and won't have a class Reform bill like this: which would enfranchise the Working Man and not
     the farm-labourer. “But the manufacturing hands are more intelligent and earn twice the wages
     of the clodhoppers – and you should give their brains a vote. Don't be dunned into doing what
     is right.” At Stoke Poges we inspect the churchyard where Gray lies – the old church and its
     ivy would look better without its new spire and chimneys. Then on to Burnham Beeches – my first
     visit. And after lamb and lobster and veal and ham pie and salad and.champagne cup, upriseth
     the Professor and quoteth Bully Bottom, “Pat pat – there is a convenient place for our
     rehearsal – discourse “most obscenely” – The obscenity may follow later in the evening. Shirley
     has made many good suggestions but never one so good as this: That the contributors should mark
     today, at the end of Volume 50, their affection and respect for one who in his tact and skill
     in government equals our lamented premier (Palmerston) – our dear friend, Mark Lemon. ... And
     then handeth over a watch and chain, with 11 links, the mystic number of the
      <title>Punch</title> Staff.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn490" n="489">
      <p> The present was Brooks’s idea. See Brooks to Percival Leigh, June 7, 1866 (transcribed by
       Silver): “It </p>
      <p>would much please dear Mark, I am certain, if we the writers and artists gave him some
       trifle (pin, ring or </p>
      <p>something) on the Silver Wedding. Let us subscribe a pound apiece. If you like, I will see
       to the small </p>
      <p>trouble.”</p></note> –Mark sitting at the head of the tablecloth, flanked on the right by
     Pater and on the left by Shirley, covers his eyes for a moment. “It needeth not this, my
     friends, to assure me of your esteem for me. But I shall ever wear it next my heart. ... You
     have lightened my labour by your readiness at all times to [crossed out: “do each other’s
     work”] help me all you can. The <title>Punch</title> Brotherhood has been one of the most
     extraordinary literary brotherhoods the world has ever seen. We have never had a serious
     dispute. And in our so working together, proprietors and contributors, lies the secret of our
     great success. I received a pound a week at first for Editing – but as the success increased my
     salary increased ... Our brotherhood shows that, irritable as authors may be called, they yet
     can work together, if joined by real friendship and working for a good end. And
      <title>Punch</title> has worked for a good end – and done a great good. Shirley's admirable
     preface is not overpraise. <title>Punch</title> has blotted out <title>The Age</title> and
      <title>Satirist</title> and other vile publications, which before <title>Punch</title> existed
     were the only amusing journals of the day. ... Forgive my mother's weakness – I feel more than
     I can say. I know I have done my duty – but I did not expect this kind acknowledgment from you
     ... I am sure you will be glad to learn I am a hundred guineas richer than I was this morning.
     I received them in a letter which I shall value as much as the money it contained. This is
      <title>Punch</title>'s Silver Wedding. I cannot hope to live to see the golden one. But
      <title>Punch</title> must always prosper if confidence prevails.</p>
    <p>Then Shirley handeth Mark the letters we all wrote to testify our gladness at the gift
     proposed. Bennett heads his with a drawing and so does Du Maurier – who writes the longest
     note. C.K.'s the shortest – “All right.”“Jackides” proffers “2 lbs. if necessary, or any larger
     sum.” Burnand says he is at Little Hampton and has just knocked off the Second Act of La Belle
     Helène. “Ponny” overflows with sympathy. Tom Taylor adds a P.S. which is inter-lined and
     corrected, as his “copy” always is. Percival Leigh and Henry Silver simply say how glad they
     are to join, and Shirley has all the notes bound in a small volume and writes one to introduce
     them to his dear old friend.</p>
    <p>Bennett and I (who sit between J.T. and Will Agnew, next whom is Burnand, all on Mark's right
     hand) drink from the same glass and find the drink is potent. We almost in fact “cup us till
     our heads go round.” </p>
    <p>Then J.T. and F.C.B. have a mock sparring match, “getting away” so cleverly that they almost
     get out of sight. And C.K. and P.L. go mushroom hunting and find a yellow fungus which turns
     blue when ex- posed to air inside. Then down comes a little rain and thunder growls and we
     drive by Dropmore and see the lovely Diodoras and so reach Skindle's at Maiden- head. D.M. and
     F.C.B. and C.H.B. and H.S. riding together thither and from Slough. F.C.B. amusing us with the
     drunken old fellows who tried to say “judicious.” “Admiral Codrington was a most seducious
     man.” No, you don't mean seducious – I know the word you mean ... chorus: “We know the word you
     mean – [crossed out].” “And you're bound to tell us – bound!” da capo a dozen times ... “It's
     judicious.” </p>
    <p>At Skindle's we shake hands with dear old Bradbury. (Said D.M. at lunch: “Bradbury looks the
     most uncomfortable man here” – meaning his position on the grass … but I apply it to his
     position on <title>Punch</title>, after the row about D.M.'s pay and seeing our good feeling
     towards Mark) ... then some go on the river and get drenched in a thundershower, and I walk
     with Bennett. And at six we dine. – “You look like a gamekeeper, Silver – so weatherbeaten,”
     says Tom Taylor – who joins us. Thanks to the Pyrenees, say I: and wonder thinking of their
     beauties that Tom doesn't know them. At dinner we sit thus: </p>
    <p> Evans, P.L., F.C.B., C.K., J.H.Agnew, H.M., T.T., Mark Lemon </p>
    <p>F.E. First time of meeting of the Whole Eighteen! W.B.</p>
    <p> Wm. Agnew, J.T., S.B., H.B., Tom Agnew, H.S., DM, Bradbury</p>
    <p>W.B. proposes Mark's health – hopes new firm will keep the friendships formed by the old one
     – difficult for young men to feel the sentiments of older ones. Presents a noble silver cup.
     ... Whereat Mark buries his face in his hands. ... While we get up, and, D.M. duce, give him
     musical honors with all our hearts and voices. – Mark after recovery speaks out boldly and
     emphatically that friendship and confidence between all the <title>Punch</title> Men, Editor
     and contributors and proprietors have been and must be the great cause of Success ... Then he
     drinks to the two who “made <title>Punch </title>what it is” – who had confidence in it and in
     him from the first and have handed down that confidence and may it never cease till death. </p>
    <p>We drink to B. and E. out of the Cup. And they warmly say their thanks and tell us that their
     best friends have been the men on <title>Punch</title>. And that <title>Punch</title> has
     brought them as much pleasure and pride as profit. ... Then Shirley proposes “The New Firm,”
     and says it has always been his pleasure to work for <title>Punch</title> and he has given it
     his best work. And so have we all.</p>
    <p>W.B. and F.E. and Wm. A. all say their thanks – and the latter adds that his children have
     been pleased and taught by <title>Punch</title> – “And if ever there's incarnate truth and
     goodness in the world, it is in little children – and to please them <title>Punch</title> is
     truth.” </p>
    <p>Tom Agnew proposes “the Contributors” and calls on Leigh to respond, as being six weeks the
     senior of “Ponny” on the staff. But Leigh wanders into talking of an argument he had with the
     proposer, and so Shirley has to answer for us – in spite of his hoarse voice. “We are, there's
     no denying it, a Remarkable Lot. There's no mock modesty in me, or real modesty either. But
     look at us. All come from different spheres of society and bring our experiences thence to be
     fused in the <title>Punch</title> fire. .... Tom Taylor who mingles with the aristocrats, and
     Horace who is only known in the back slums of the Haymarket etc. I begin with Horace ... who
     lives in the most unmitigated profligacy but has the kindest of hearts and in his time has done
     much good work on <title>Punch</title>. Of Tom Taylor, I need only say that we are all proud to
     work with him … Charles Keene lives in Baker Street and is connected with the Wax Works, but
     when not engaged as a showman makes most capital <title>Punch</title> cuts. The Professor lives
     at Hammersmith and indulges in improper intercourse with very elderly females (Mrs. Snorter!),
     but is never late with his “copy”, and writes what everyone delights to read. Of John Tenniel I
     need only say it is our pride to have him illustrate our thoughts. Burnand is half out of the
     window (like Tom Taylor) and if he were quite out, I could say more about his merits. He is the
     most successful burlesque writer of the day, and holds nightly in his hand the ears of many
     thousands. And he writes the most surprising nonsense – and good sense. How he does it, I don't
     know. I only know that I could not. Mr. Bennett peoples pages with fairies – and is up to all
     the games of politics – nothing ever escapes his eye and whatever his eye sees his pencil
     produces. Then I come to Silver who lives nobody knows where – when I wake a nights, to think
     where Silver lives and what he does when he's not writing is one of the puzzles that perplex
     me. But he is up in sporting matters and he keeps us well informed in yachting and shooting,
     and he is a good fellow (which is best of all). Then I come to Du Maurier whose Legend of
     Camelot is an honour to <title>Punch</title>, – and I hardly know which to praise most, his
     pencil or his pen. And as to myself, I have given <title>Punch</title> my best work – and I
     never enjoy working so much as for <title>Punch</title>. I was at Margate fifteen years ago
     when Mark asked me to join. I began with “Miss Violet” and have rarely let a number pass
     without an article of mine. I am the connecting link between the old men and the new. And it
     will ever be my pride and pleasure to be with the men of <title>Punch</title>. After this good
     speech we drink Shirley's health and Mark testifies to his worth and work. Tom Taylor proposes
     the Memory of the Contributors and Artists departed – Jerrold, à Beckett, Thackeray and Leech:
     which we drink upstanding and in Silence. </p>
    <p>And then after a song or two we get back by the 11 o'clock train: after a most pleasurable
     and memorable day.</p>

       been commissioned in 1859 from Sir Edwin Landseer, but were delayed for years while the
       artist worked on other commissions. The delays had long been a standing joke in the capital
       by the time the statues were finally unveiled in 1867. For Tenniel’s opinion of their merits,

    <p>Dear Mr. Lemon, </p>
    <p>“The Lost Pleiad” has been discovered in London at last, and may be seen daily with the naked
     eye. My wife says London is Beestly in comparison with Bordeaux, but that I am a bon garçon and
     we English are not such Brutes as she expected. We go to Mrs. Leech's house next week for a few
     months, to see how Kensington air suits French lungs, and I hope you will now and then
     condescend (as Bloated Editor) to come and see your heretofore wandering contributor. Feb. 1,

       In his diary for April 1, 1867, Shirley Brooks records his first visit to the couple there:
       “We dined at poor J. Leech’s house, now in the occupation of the newly wed Henry Silver &amp;
       met his wife for the first time. Much pleased with her. The furniture is Mrs Leech’s, &amp;
       it was like a theatrical scene—old properties, but a change of actors. Ainsi va la monde. A
       very good dinner &amp; wine good—Mrs H.S.’s papa is in the line—but he did not give me a
       weed, which was fiendish.” (British Library)</p></note></p>

     tradesmen wait and having a trip out. Apropos of Hepworth Dixon's book on “New America” (too
     long and too made up) Shirley says a man wants 4 wives at least: an intellectual wife to talk
     to, a sensual one to kiss, a clever one to cook and one to sew his buttons on. P.L. says
     woman's intellect supplies the vacancies in man's…quicker instincts but no reasoning. M.L. “I

     “We must cut away our top hamper (resolutions) to save the Ship.” Or Diz as the New Medea

     Polyphemus, Bright!” the thundering giant roars.” ... But it won't be understood. So let's have

    <p>Saith Du Maurier, “Why not attend more to the breeding of mankind – select brides and grooms

     proposing for a thin girl and her father saying, “Pauleana! No, Fatima is the girl you want.”

     congratulate him, and Prince of Wales has sent for a proof. Mark talks of his feeling sure it
     would be a grand cut – and complains that the Professor called it “mere commonplace record” (!)
     and C.K. rather snubbed the notion. Tom, the father, regrets Tenniel did not make wolves
     tearing Gladstone down, and so stopping their chase. </p>
    <p>We all consider it Tenniel's grandest cut since The Bengal Tiger. (Shirley tomorrow when we
     dine with him specifies the upset of Diz's donkey cart, by Pam's Derby Drag, as being very
     happy.) Mark thinks the sale won't be increased above 2,000 by the cut this week. But such

      <p> Tom Taylor’s <title>The Antipodes</title>,<title> or</title>,<title> the Ups and Downs of
        Life</title> made its debut at the Holborn Theatre on June 8, 1867, with Ellen Terry in a
       small role, one of her first returns to the stage after the failure of her marriage. John
       Oxenford’s review in the <title>Times</title> (June 12, 1867, p. 6) castigated the piece as
       “an extremely clumsy piece of workmanship,” at whose conclusion “the audience are liberated
       from a dreary, complicated, uninteresting story, which has made them regret that the word
        <title>Antipodes</title> is only the title of the play, and does not indicate the place at
       which it is performed.” These remarks in the diary suggest that Oxenford was reacting to
       Taylor’s criticism of his reviews as “milk and water,” but an alternative explanation emerged
       years later, when “Atlas” (Edmund Yates) used his column in <title>The World</title> to quote
       a letter from Burnand asserting that Oxenford’s review was revenge for a review by Taylor.
       According to Burnand, Taylor had taken Oxenford’s place as the <title>Times</title> critic
       during the former’s trip to America earlier in 1867, and had taken the opportunity to
       severely criticize one of Oxenford’s plays. According to Burnand, on his return Oxenford was
       “made aware of what happened during his absence; for, mild and indulgent critic usually, on
       the next prosecution of a ‘new and original’ drama by Mr. Tom Taylor, he wrote a notice in
       the <title>Times</title> which took the skin off the author, from his nape to his heels.” See
       “What the World Says,” <title>The World</title> 23 (2 September 1885) 17. (Thanks to Kathryn
       Ledbetter for supplying information about <title>The World</title>.) I have been unable to
       trace this <title>Times</title> review of Oxenford by Taylor.</p></note> Shirley says, “You
     blamed his rosewater and now he shows he can write vitriol.” Tom thinks a man a wretch who
     allows personal antipathy to bias criticism. The stage might benefit the country and <title>The
      Times</title> by honest criticism might benefit the stage. Shirley says it’s human nature to
     spite a man who injures you, and Oxenford resigned because you spoke of his milk and water
     style, and said he, “I don't break butterflies upon a wheel.” Besides, no critic can kill a
     good piece.</p>

     horses, Democracy and Toryism.” Tom adds Bright as Clown – and Gladstone holding £6 franchise
     Bar, which Diz has leapt over.” This we accept – but then the fertile Tom suggests as more à

    <p>Lord Strangford, who has a philological wife (and therefore no children, says Kiki)
     criticizes Tenniel's Dizzy's dialect: “I'd loike to zee yow droive un!” as being a mixture from
     three counties: Yorks: Somerset: and Suffolk. Tenniel owns to its being adapted from the Stage.
     But Mark contends it should be a general sort of dialect – as Diz speaks as Premier of
     England.</p>

       what became a series of articles by Linton vitriolically attacking the aspirations,
       appearance, and behavior of middle-class young women. “The Girl of the Period” created a
       sensation and was re-issued in a pamphlet form that sold tens of thousands of copies, while
       the series inspired an almanac and a short-lived monthly magazine. See Merle Mowbray

     know such girls? says Shirley. No – not altogether – but the taint soon spreads, and Swellesses
     are copied. Miss Gascoigne dyes her hair: and Annie R. powders her face. Still they are both
     nice girls notwithstanding. But certainly a modest mien is rarer than it was. And I prefer
     delicacy and softness to a bold face and hard manner. </p>

     Diz's speech, “I'm on the side of the Angels” and would have him as the Guardian Angel of the
     Church confronting G. as the Demon. </p>
    <p>H.M. proposes G. as Samson pulling down the pillars of the Church. C.K. proposes Tournament
     for Place (which perhaps is true), G. and D. on hobby horses – Ireland Queen of Beauty. Shirley
     suggests, “Thais led the way to light him to his prey.” Bright leading Gladstone. – After a
     long debate T.T. solves the problem by suggesting Diz as an old hen gathering Irish bishops
     under wing while G. is the hawk pouncing ... Ponny suggests 2 weathercocks fighting – funny but
     impossible – but cock fight is a good notion and Mark combines the two ideas: Diz and Glad, two
     cocks, while mother church gathers little chickens together. Sympathy would go with Diz if
     Glad. were made the hawk. And clearly the Church is doomed - - [<ref target="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.32106019785713&amp;seq=156"><title>Punch</title>, 54 (4 April 1868): 148-49, “Battle of the Spurs”</ref>].</p>

    <p>A snowy walk home! Summer last week. Shirley tells funny story of a Judge summing up a case –

      <p> Shirley Brooks recorded this anecdote in his own diary on February 14, 1865, a story he
       heard the evening before at Mr. Justice Shee’s dinner table (Sir William Shee [1804-1868]),
       told by lawyer and politician Henry James (1828-1911) about Mr. Justice Byles (Sir John
       Bernard Byles [1804-1884]): “James told a good bit of Byles, charging a jury in a case where
       a man had called another a b. and had also, in rage, applied the term to his grandmother, a
       bookcase, a little dog, and an anchovy. “I am bound to tell you, gentlemen, that in two of
       these cases, the word implied an impossibility.”</p></note>

    <p>M.L. proposes with a quiver in his voice the health of our dear friend Ponny: I'm your oldest
     friend at the table – we've grown old together in years and iniquity – that is, I’ve done the
     years, and you the iniquity. You are, next to me, the oldest worker on <title>Punch</title>,

      <title>Punch</title> – how we met at the Edinburgh Castle once and debated whether to go on!
     We paid literature more liberally than had been done – were laughed at by our fellow

    <p>I thought Mark was chaffing when last week he joked about Ponny being married and the
     Haymarket nighthouses being closed in consequence. But – vide suprà. So I drink to him – and
     his. Never too late to mend. </p>
    <p>Shirley asks if the Romans spoke of “meretrix” as “conciliatrix.” Tom Taylor has been staying
     at Bamboro' Castle in Northumberland – fine site – interesting memories. How well he looks! And
     how many walnuts he eats! Shirley's remedy for street robberies: Castrate your ruffians after
     the second offense. 80,000 thieves in the 35 millions here: Logic says Exterminate the
     nuisance. Mark contends that the State is to blame – no work for man after prison. Children of
     criminals should be confiscated to the State and compulsorily educated.</p>
    <p>T.T. says Durham Cathedral the finest specimen of Norman .. Describes rocks 600 feet on coast
     where a fisherman once leaped 12 feet across! Sensation scene. D.M. writes, “Although my

    <p>You’ll find the Spectre Subject punctual.”</p>

      <p> “The Count of Monte Cristo” at the Adelphi, a lavish production nearly five hours long
       starring Benjamin Webster as Noirtier and Charles Fechter as Edmond Dantès, met a disastrous
       reception on its opening night of 18 October 1868; the <title>Times</title> the following day
       noted that “hisses were abundant” (10d). Shortened and revised in response to widespread
       criticism, the play ran for ninety-six performances, closing in early February. See <ref target="https://www.umass.edu/AdelphiTheatreCalendar/m68d.htm#Label003">Alfrida Lee, “The

    <p>L.C. J.T. and P.L. advocate a slash at the Street ruffian - Mayne to blame. T'other night
     burglars overheard planning, yet it was hard to make police defend. S.B. suggests Dizzy Canute
     reproving Courtiers – “See, the tide of public opinion is gaining ground against me.” Also:
     How's the Marker? Diz and Glad. at billiards ... Gladstone, “Coming to his Majority,” ...
     apropos of Election .. also, parody of the old lines – “Tis time we should part, my dear Sue:
     For your character's totally lost, And I've not sufficient for two.” Sue, the Irish Church –
     and the fair speaker the English. </p>
    <p>T.T. suggests Diz as the political parrot who “says nothing but thinks the more” – apropos of
     his silence just now, and Gladstone's speeches. </p>
    <p>J.T. reverts to his suggestion of Tournament, Diz and Glad. as Knights. Bright the Squire
     “accomplishing” the latter – Shirley suggests Diz as Richard Third in the Ghost Scene – but the
     Professor by a happy thought improves this to Diz, as Gloucester between the English and Irish
     churches. “See where his Grace stands 'twixt two clergymen.” Accepted. [ <ref target="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hxpqvi&amp;seq=205"><title>Punch</title>,

    <p>Religious jaw ... Ponny thinks it sufficient to say the Lord's Prayer and trust to an all

     satisfaction. Herein H.S. agrees. Try to do your duty and obey your conscience and have faith
     in God's mercy. Were we tried by man, who of us would see Heaven? Mill wrong to subscribe to
     the atheist blasphemous Bradlaugh for his election – but right to say that voters should not
     too narrowly scrutinise their member's religious faith. “Cui bono?” is the strong point with an
     atheist. What good to create a world in which so much misery will come? But cui bono such
     arguments? The world is made and we are alive and instead of guessing why we are, we should try

    <p>Says he conceived the third Act of “The Overland Route” in a ten minute walk on Wandsworth
     Common. Sat down at 1 p.m. and wrote currente calamo till 1 a.m. as fast as his wife could
     copy, and so finished Act. But he says now he always works in the morning – less exhausting –
     greatest nerve-force at night – and playwriting is exciting and should be done cool. He is
     never so happy as when hard worked – hard work never killed a man – but badly arranged work,
     ill timed, may do so. </p>
    <p>Apropos of T.W. Robertson's “School,” Burnand christens him, “The Dramatic Trollope.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn585" n="584">
      <p> “School,” by Tom Robertson (1829-1871) made its debut at the Prince of Wales Theatre in
       January, 1869. With “Society,” in 1865, also at the Prince of Wales, Robertson had introduced
       a new naturalism to the English stage that would come to seem revolutionary. For some of the
       implications of these changes, see George Taylor, <title>Players and Performances in the
        Victorian Theatre</title> (Manchester: Manchester Univ. Press, 1989), 97-104.</p></note>
     Taylor says “Trollope astounds me, makes commonplace life and characters interesting, tho' he
     has the worst of styles in writing.” Shirley says “He astounds me by his power of work – fancy
     getting up at 5 and sitting down in a cold room, with grubby hands after lighting your own
     fire, and then writing about pretty girls and love matches and so forth.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn586" n="585">
      <p> The reading public would come to know about Anthony Trollope’s habits of work many years
       later from his posthumously published <ref target="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000450376/Home">An Autobiography (Edinburgh:
        Blackwood, 1883)</ref>, but these remarks make clear that those habits were already well
       known enough among some of his fellow writers to be a topic of conversation. See the entry
       for March 8, 1870, for additional talk about Trollope’s writing habits. Brooks had come to
       know Trollope at the Garrick Club; “I like him,” he wrote, “after one gets used to his
       intense manner” (Brooks diary, 11 March 1864 [Houghton Library]).</p></note> – T.T., “My wife
     reads all his novels to me.” – “A case for a divorce,” says Shirley. Shirley says, “I'm ashamed
     to find myself laughing with the Gallery.”</p>
    <p>L.C. T.T. suggests “New Brooms” apropos of Admiralty circular about Economy. Old Ministers as
     housemaids looking on “Devil of a dust: Let's see what comes of it” Apropos of Emperor's
     Speech, Shirley would parody “Critic:” – “When I behold these armaments – forgive me friend if
     the conjecture's rash, the State methinks some danger apprehends.” </p>
    <p>But Mark thinks the Ritualists, for their squabbling Meeting, deserve a Cut: Suggests Pope as

    <p>D.M. discourseth on Religion! Can't comprehend men going to Church – believes in doing his
     duty according to his conscience, and leaving God to save him or not as he thinks right. But
     this substitutes your conscience for God. And your conscience may be warped – an unhappy faith.
     Think ill health is punishment enough for any sins he may have committed. Don't believe in Hell

      <p> The sensational trail of Saurin v. Star involved a civil suit by a former inmate of the
       Sisters of Mercy convent at Hull alleging that she had been unfairly expelled “with
       imputations on her character.” Extensive press reports of the trial inflamed anti-Catholic
       prejudice with their rare and unflattering accounts of life inside a convent, accounts which,
       in the words of the opening remarks of the Solicitor-General, showed “what women were capable
       of when they shut themselves up from their kind” (<title>Times</title>, February 4, 1869, p.
       10). The Lord Chief Justice's summing-up took an entire day and occupied five columns in the
        <title>Times</title> of February 27, 1869 (pp.11-12). The jury found for the plaintiff on
       the major counts, assessing damages in the amount of £200. The <title>Times</title>
       commented, “Thus ended this extraordinary case which, while it lasted, caused an excitement

       the public mind. It was agreed to, but we had much trouble hitting on a theme, so I suggested
       Protestantism, freed from chains, rising like an angel, or that one in the ‘Hermit’, and
       delighting Ireland. Leigh d—d Protestantism, but something like my notion was agreed to.”

     December 44: teste lapide [witness the stone], left of school door: 4th from foundation: “H.
     Silver, 1844.”</p>
    <p>Mathematical room built on our Classic fighting ground behind School – where Gill and Gibbs
     fought. Coffin and Cobbold's memorable battle was in Verites Yard. Of this I'm reminded by
     Sarjeaunt the Short, who's as grey as a badger and I've scarce turned a hair yet – but was he
     not my fag? And does he not remember the building of the room aforesaid in '45 or '6? Jolly old
     it makes one feel to hear such an old greybeard call one a contemporary, and find he's your
     junior? </p>
    <p>And there's poor Billy Hale – nigh bent double. Wonder how many of my schoolfellows are as
     well as I am. Should make a man contented. Saddens one to see Under Green boarded round, half
     already sold. Verites' Yard absorbed, so as to lengthen the racket court. Same desks, cut to
     pieces – wonder if my name's on Verites new Longroom table still – with those of the other
     Mother Catherine Conspirators. Remember how we pelted her with potatoes and some score of us
     were flogged for it. We see the fatal block – and the horseshoes before the masters' desks.
     Poynder and old Hale scarce look older than when I left them. [Note in black ink, probably

     right to criticise a picture – J.T. agrees – H.S. differs. Why should not painting be
     criticised as well as stage playing or novelists or poets or other inventors? Beethoven is

     criticise a singer – why need he practice painting in order to criticise it. </p>

      <p> “The Fool's Revenge,” by Tom Taylor, starred Wybert Rousby in the part of Bertuccio and

       Taylor's review, which appeared in the <title>Times</title> on Dec. 21, 1869, p. 8, opens
       with a defense of the originality of the play despite its adaptation of the plot from Hugo's
        <title>Le Roi S'amuse</title> and the opera, <title>Rigoletto</title>, founded on it.
       (Taylor had been much criticised for his borrowings from French plays.) Praising all the
       performances, the review concludes, “We are delighted to welcome the exchange at this theatre
       of the coarser for the more truly dramatic form of sensation...in which the imagination is
