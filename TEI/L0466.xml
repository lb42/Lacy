     <head>Scene I. </head>
     <stage>The Quay of St. Helier's, Jersey. Fort Regent extending along the L.; St. Aubin's Bay
      flowing at the back, with Castle Elizabeth in the distance; a yatch at anchor, and other
      craft; L. and R. are shops, with French names over the door; R., “Michael Bitaube,” “Marchand
      de Vine”— L., “Pierre Vimand,” “Coiffeur et Peruquier.”</stage>
     <stage>As the Curtain rises, a group of Normandy Girls are discovered R. U. E., with baskets of
      fruit, &amp;c.; L. U. E., before the Barber's door, an old French Soldier, a Priest, and a
      Tradesman are seated smoking, and reading a newspaper;—at the back in the centre stand a group
      of Jersey Sailors looking off at the bay through glasses; cries are then heard as of a boat
      mooring:— “Garde Garde—Prenez la corde;” A rope is now thrown to the group in centre, who make
      it fast to a post, R. U. E.</stage>
     <stage>Prong advances from L. U. E.</stage>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>O, ho! the Southampton packet! Who does she bring to-day, I wonder?—any one in my way?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>A party of Passengers mount the quay, R. U. E., and pass off, L., followed by the
      Normandy Girls crying Madame, Monsieur, will you buy, if you please?—The party at the Barber's
      door then rise and enter the shop.</stage>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p> Yes, yes; a very respectable party. Oh, the town's filling—money will be spent here—my
       scheme must succeed. Yes, after rambling all my days in order to effect my great object, here
       I rest at last in the Island of Jersey—Jersey, which I mean to render the model of watering
       places. Brighton was too hot for me; a positive oven—with the sea always serving as a
       block-tin reflector;—Hastings too high again; people climbing all day there like rats in a
       cistern;—but here is the very thing; a beautiful country—a magnificent sea—all the elements
       at hand, wanting only the creative mind to bring their charms to
       <pb n="4"/> a focus—and here is the focus. <stage>(takes out a copy book and reads)</stage>
       “Prospectus of assembly rooms to be built in St. Helier's by shares and subscriptions;
       limited liability”—nothing like that! “and opened under the direction of Charles Claude
       Prong, Esq., M.C.A.H.M.S.,” which, of course, is to say—Master of Ceremonies, at Her
       Majesty's Service. There's my grand plan;— “The St. Helier's Assembly Room Company,
       Limited”—not, by the bye, that I want the company limited—and here's my list of subscribers,
       consisting at present of one—my friend Lascelles; but then everything must have a beginning,
       and— <stage>Bitaube comes from his shop, R.</stage> </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Good morning, Monsieur Prong.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Ah, Bitaube, my boy, how are you to-day? What's   for dinner?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Dinner, sare?—nosing, sare, nosing.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Ah, you mean to say nothing to astonish me;— merely a bit of salmon, or chicken, or—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>No, sare, dere is no shicken; dere is nosing here but an old goose, and him you have live
       on long enough.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>What do you mean?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Moi, sare—myself—you have been wis me six weeks, and pay me nosing but compliment.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>But haven't I ensured you? haven't I recommended you to some of my first friends in
       London—a mass of rank and fashion who will come over and patronize you.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Oh, bah, bah!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Bah, bah, sir!—that's the language of a sheep not a goose. I say that actuated by a spirit
       of the purest philanthropy,—I have worked night and day to benefit you and your island—to
       build a decoy-duck, in the shape of assembly-rooms.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Oh, yase; you build beautiful room, but he is all in de cloud, sare—he is all in de
       air!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>So is oxygen in the air, sir, but we contrive to get hold of it! My scheme may be vapory,
       may be only floating at present; but here's its condenser, here's my prospectus. And what's a
       prospectus? Why the talisman of commerce—the great charm of the stock market, with which we
       conjure up   capital faster than a witch could do spirits; with a few waves of this, and up
       go my rooms, and once they are up, not a fashionable bird of passage, but will perch on this
       island.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Or perhaps, de bird of prey. Here is my bill, sare, will you pay him if you please?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <stage> (taking it)</stage>
      <p>Fifteen pounds odd.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Certainment, if you, please.</p>
      <pb n="5"/>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Very good, then I'll tell you what we'll do—I won't pay you this money. I'll do a better
       thing than that—I'll invest it for you, and then you know it will give you an income. I'll
       put you down for a couple of shares.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>A couple of share?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>That will be twenty pounds, and as you'll then owe me five, you can hand me the
       difference.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Why, I am putrified.</p>

     </sp>
     <stage>Duparc mounts the quay, Sailor and luggage, R. U. E., and advances.</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>Now, then, to look round and find some of my acquaintance—Bitaube!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Duparc!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>Old friend, give me your hand. <stage>(C.)</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Serait il possible, mon bon ami, est ce vous. <stage>(R.)</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <stage> (aside)</stage>
      <p>Who's this I wonder?<stage> (L.)</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, my friend, it is I, after a long three years' absence.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Quel bonheur! Why, mon brave, we all thought you were dead.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>   And really with some reason considering the climate I've been in—that of a land where
       disease and peril were my hourly companions—but it pleased heaven to preserve me, and to
       repay my hard labours. I am happy to say, I have returned, not only with enough for all my
       own wants, but to spare to an old friend, should I find one less fortunate.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <stage> (aside)</stage>
      <p>What a noble-hearted fellow. I see a subscriber!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Quel bonheur—I'm so glad—I—I must tell my poor wife, Madame Bitaube.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <stage> (detaining him)</stage>
      <p>No, no, you must first delight me; you know how many here are dear to me, and one above
       all, Marie—she is well?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Oh, oui, quite well.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>Thank heaven! I have not heard from her for a year past, and I almost feared to ask the
       question.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <stage> (aside)</stage>
      <p>Oho, a wife in view—a double subscription!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>She's still with her kind protector?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Oh, yase, with Major Audley, and he love her more than ever.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Bless my soul, sir, is the lady you allude to,— that very charming person I've seen with
       Major Audley?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, sir, his adopted daughter.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Then, I must say a real one couldn't have been worthier of his taste.</p>
      <pb n="6"/>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>   Say, rather, sir, his heart.—She was the orphan of a fisherman, whom he gave a home to
       in infancy, but he was soon well rewarded,—the grave had made him solitary, and she became
       more than child to him, she proved his friend and his staff.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Oui, and his pair of spectacles, for since he have got blind—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>Blind!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Yase, have you not hear?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>Not a word.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Oh, yase—tres malheureux—he nevare go out now, but Marie have to lead him.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>And so charmingly she does it, sir, you'd really imagine that to lose your sight was the
       true way to enjoy walking.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>Poor Mr. Audley!—but Bitaube, this is a sad life for Marie.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Oh, vare sad—vare—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Sad, sir, I say it's horrible—you don't know how I've pitied her—a girl so young and
       lovely, shut out from all amusements, not even an assembly-room to go to—such an evil must be
       remedied. We must build rooms—we must build them and I trust, sir, that in a purpose so
       purely philanthropical, I may count on your assistance.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>Of course, you may heartily.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>   Of course, I may heartily; I was sure you would say that, sir—so allow me with great
       pleasure to put you down for a ten pound share, one pound deposit.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Diable take de share, is dis a time for business? Come in, my friend, and sit down; Madame
       Bitaube, voici mon vieux ami Henri Duparc—entrez, mon cher—entrez.</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>  (he enters his shop, R., followed by Duparc)</stage>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Come, my book's improving, just now I had but one name—now I've got a couple—a couple—I see
       the approach of a whole army of subscribers; this Duparc suggests a host. The first step is
       the difficulty, it is to set the machine going, once off it goes by itself, goes freely and
       goes rapidly; especially if its progress should happen to be down hill.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Voices.</speaker>
      <stage> (cries heard outside, R.)</stage>
      <p>Vive, Monsieur, Vive, l'Anglaise!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p> Eh, my friend, Lascelles, landing from his yacht. Now, shall I stay and get his deposit
       or—what are they doing in the shop, there? actually attacking a leg of pork!—their raptures
       over they go to dinner—they seek to give increased foundation to the pleasure of this
       meeting. Well, that really seems very sensible as well as very genial, so I'll just step in
       <pb n="7"/> and show them that my nature on this point is as open as their own.
       <stage>(enters the shop)</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <stage>  (Music.—Lascelles and Rawdon mount the quay in yachting costume; the Normandy Girls
      return, L. U. E. and surround them)</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Girls.</speaker>
      <p>Monsieur, Monsieur, will you buy, if you please?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Will I buy you, little angels! What fruit to compare with these lips and cheeks?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>1st Girl.</speaker>
      <p>   Buy mine, sir.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>2nd Girl.</speaker>
      <p>Buy mine.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lasce.</speaker>
      <p>Now, was ever a man so distressingly circumstanced? when to select from one basket is to
       disparage another—when to take from the fair Louise is to insult the sweet Cecile. I see,
       ladies, but one way to escape this dilemma, and since justice forbids my preferring one
       stock—to try to balance matters by purchasing all.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>All!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Every pippin. Turn your fruit into my cutter, and there's three Napoleons to divide amongst
       you.</p>

      <p>Oh, merci—merci!</p>

     <stage>   He throws the money into a basket, they run off at back, R.</stage>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p> <stage>(L.) </stage>Well, it's really wonderful what a man feels after a little
       philanthropy. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p><stage> (R.) </stage>Wonderful indeed. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>There's a something so dignified in encouraging industry—a sense of such duty—and when its
       objects of course, are of the tenderer sex—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>A sphere so all-embracing—I'm really very sorry to throw a chill on such emotions, but do
       you know that to-day is the twenty-eighth, and that on the first of the month you're expected
       in London?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Now, now, my dear fellow, if you must be an almanac, don't always predict storm. Can't we
       run across in a day?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Not with this wind;—we may be blown out to sea.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>   Well, then, we'll go to sea.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>As you please; but you'll remember I haven't failed to warn you.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>When did I ever deny your friendship? Though a little acid at times, haven't I imbibed it
       like sound claret all the year round?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p> Then I wish 'twere as beneficial. It seems to me you must be mad—when you know your
       uncle's temper, and twice already have enraged him by breaking your word. Is your conduct
       even honest—when having agreed to marry your cousin on condition he paid your debts, and
       being allowed by
       <pb n="8"/> him very generously this preliminary trip, you happen to meet in Jersey with a
       trumpery French peasant— </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Come, come, Rawdon, civil terms, if you please; I have told you that I love the girl.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Love her, indeed.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, sir, I love her, and that so sincerely, I can't allow her even to be sneered at. You
       do not know or you'd not defame her; you judge her only by the girls about here—these minxes
       of the island, who would sell themselves as readily as the fruit they bring to market. Ah! if
       you had but talked to her; if you had but passed as I have done but one evening by her
       side—you would not wonder at her influence; you would believe me when I tell you that she has
       made me feel myself a humbler and a better man.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>   But what's it all to end in, you can't marry her?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Of course not.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>And would not wrong her?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Rawdon!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Then it's plain you must desert her, and after you have won the girl's affections—leaving
       her I admit to the usual remedy—self-destruction.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Gracious powers!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>From which there lies but one escape,—but one course which would either satisfy her
       scruples, or your wishes —to marry her by a priest, and when you get to England—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Tell her 'twas illegal! Rawdon—are you a man?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, and a considerate one—if deceit is to be practised, I propose that which would inflict
       on her the least amount of suffering.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Say no more, I'd perish first.</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Oh, Lascelles, my boy—how are you? have you seen the Major to-day?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>The Major, why do you ask?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>For a very pleasant reason; my old friend, Duparc has just returned home to Jersey, and
       he's going to marry his daughter.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>What do you say?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Oh, yes, they were engaged long ago, but family misfortunes compelled him to
       emigrate—obliged him to leave   her, poor fellow—till having got himself round, here he's
       come home again to reward her for waiting.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>It cannot be, sir.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p> But I tell you it is—they are about to go into a matrimonial joint stock—he had paid a
       deposit, he had pledged her his word, and now he's come home to pay up in full—and
       <pb n="9"/> talking of his spec reminds me of mine, did you say one share or six? </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>A dozen, only answer me.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p> A dozen! bless my soul. <stage>(booking it)</stage> Mr. Lascelles, 12 shares. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Answer me, I say, sir—is his passion returned?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Returned, why she doats on him, she has sent him epistles so burning, they have almost
       turned to tinder before they arrived.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>So, she'll not be broken-hearted.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Can she, dare she have so trifled with me.</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>But she has yet to learn he is here, and as she always brings her father into town on

     </sp>

      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>I can't believe it!—she may have been betrothed to him, may have loved him years ago, but
       not now; why, haven't I for a whole month walked and talked and sat with her— watching her
       cheeks kindle under the breathings of my passion or looking through her eyes, into the very
       fountains of her soul! but what of that? is she not a French woman? and is not coquetry the
       main-spring of such a creature's being. I see it all—I have been played with, laughed at, led
       to dangle at her heels—believing that she loved me, whilst all the while—well, well, I'll see
       her again—yes, once again, if it be only but to tell her—but—she comes.</p>

      <p>No, no—she always comes on market-day—so restez tranquille, mon ami—and you will see her in

       and now leaving him—she turns and flies this way— yes, love lends her wings—she sees
       me—Marie! Marie! <stage>    (Marie returns hastily, R. U. E., and looking round as she

      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>This hour, by the packet—and should have hastened to you at once, but that I heard you'd be
       in town to-day.—Well, love, you're not much altered, or if changed—as the spring changes the
       bud—into a fuller, richer beauty: the climate, you'll say, has done its work with me—but what
       matters that? 'tis the heart that makes us young, and that is   all your own. Oh, Marie
       to-day I feel as when a boy! Let me tell you, I've returned with ample means, and now can
       fearlessly demand your hand.</p>
     </sp>

       call to-morrow— the only sort of call that I care to make at present—a call which gets
       money—a call in which a notice replaces a card— and instead of idle compliments or a poor P.
       P. C., I draw attention to those stronger letters—L. S. D. </p>

      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>I thought he followed me, but now—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Ah, my dear friend, good day to you again.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>You here?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Well, you've seen your amiable and lovely bride?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, sir—I have seen her.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>And of course she was enraptured.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <stage> (turning away)</stage>
      <p>Of course.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>My dear sir, what's the matter? I hope nothing has occurred?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>Nothing surprising—she is a woman!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>And therefore—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>   She has deceived me.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Deceived you, bless my soul, well I'm really very sorry, though do you know—to confess the
       truth—I—I had always some misgivings, always thought there was about her— something of
       a—a—bubble concern.</p>
      <pb n="13"/>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>Let her pass—enough that I can be revenged on her misleader.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Revenged! Why, my dear friend—you—you are not going to fight, I hope?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>Immediately.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p> Impossible! you can't surely be so rash! <stage>(aside)</stage> He hasn't paid his
       deposit. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>Rash! why if I fall—I lose but what has become a burthen to me.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p> But, my dear sir, have you no compunction—no moral compunction in the matter? do you
       forget the crime you are about to commit? the great sinfulness of duelling—simply looking at
       your own share in the business—your own share, I say. <stage>(aside)</stage> And my five
       shares! </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>Peace, sir, I'm resolved.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>But—but, if you knew how much I regarded you— if you could but see into my heart, sir, when
       I tell you there's but one man in the world I've as great a respect for as yourself,— and
       that's Mr. Lascelles—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>And 'tis he I'm going to meet.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>   What do you say?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>He is my wronger.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Why, I'm ruined! here's all my building sinking in a quicksand. Shoot Lascelles! a
       gentleman who holds thirteen shares in my new company and hasn't paid up; why, hang it, sir,
       you had better shoot me. If either of you are shot, down goes my capital, never to get up
       again.</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Lascelles enters, R.</stage>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>'Tis your time, I believe—I have come without a friend, though I see you have not.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p> A friend! <stage>(crosses, R.)</stage> I hope I am the friend of both of you. My dear
       sirs, can't this matter be arranged in some way? </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p>No, sir; you will leave us.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>But—but gentlemen—my dear friends—if you knew how much I valued you—if you could only
       conceive the loss— the great loss you will become to me.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
      <p> We waste time. <stage>(crosses, C.)</stage> If your pistols are loaded, we'll at once
       exchange—and— </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>And can nothing prevail on you?</p>

      <p>There, there, it's all over with me. Was ever such a miserable, unhung wretch as I am? this
       moment with wealth before me—with a fortune in my grasp—and now, nothing but a gaping copy
       book—but they shall be prevented, I'm resolved. I'll alarm the town, I'll run to the

      <p>Yes, dearest, calm yourself. I am with you and am uninjured; Duparc, I regret to say, is

     <stage>—Parlours of Audley's House, opening through a glass door, with shutters, at back on St.
      Aubin's Bay. The shutters closed; a door R. leads to Audley's chamber; an inner room.</stage>
     <stage>Audley discovered seated at a table on his left, on which is a book—Fanchette
      waiting.</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Audley.</speaker>
      <p>Not returned, you say?</p>

      <speaker>Audley.</speaker>
      <p>And merely went out to our neighbour's to procure some drawings.—Well, well, she can't be
       long. You may go, Fanchette, you may go.</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Audley.</speaker>
      <p> I grow too querulous: the clinging thought that sight will be restored to me makes every
       day more bitter at its close, since met with hope, instead of resignation. And yet ought I
       not to be thankful? I might have been deserted in my need—left to the selfish care of
       strangers, who would have watched me only for the pittance that I paid them. When, now I have
       a friend who mingles all the feeling of a mother with a child; who anticipates my wants,
       dispels my cares, and brings back with her freshness and her soft kind voice—the sunshine and
       the air of the fair world I am shut out from.</p>

      <p>I must be cautious.</p>

      <speaker>Audley.</speaker>
      <p>'Twas nothing. My ear has grown keener since my sight has failed; 'tis a law by which
       heaven adjusts its dispensations—and yet, what increased power can compensate that loss which
       buries us as 'twere within a living prison—which makes the being gifted to command the
       world—the prey of the meanest reptile—the dependant on a child.</p>

      <p>Oh, no; not actually, but you know we measure time by our sensations, and thus, whilst you

      <p>I have to-day deprived you of your betrothed; a few years will rob you of your father—you

     <stage>—Bathing Rooms of a Village, on the banks of Southampton Water, opening through doors
      and windows at back, on beach; tables, R. and L., with newspapers; bills hang round the
      walls,—one headed “Regatta—Silver Cup, &amp;c.,” another, “Assembly Rooms—Charles Claude

     <stage>Mrs. Pipes enters from the beach, C.</stage>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
      <p>Well, this is a great day for us; this regatta was just the thing to set matters going; it
       has brought every one to the banks of Southampton Water—thanks to Mr. Lascelles, who is
       something like his own boat—just as well stored and buoyant, and as capable of carrying
       blessings all round the world.</p>
     </sp>

     <stage>Bitaube enters from the beach, C.</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Bon jour, madame.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
      <p>Good morning, sir; want a bath, if you please?</p>

      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>No, madame, no.</p>

      <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
      <p>Water's very pleasant, sir.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>C'est bien—and so is de land; I have bath every day for nothing. Will you tell me, if you

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
      <p>Mr. Lascelles, sir, Elm Lodge, close by.</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
      <p>Oh, but you can't see him yet—he is now on board his yacht, sailing for the cup.</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Well, den, his wife.</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
      <p>His wife—what, the French lady?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>C'est vrai.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
      <p>And a perfect lady she is—she bathes every morning.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Aha!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
      <p> Every one likes her, though she's been here but a fortnight; she's so affable and
       condescending, and so exceedingly   genteel; really, to see the style with which she'll give
       the
       <pb n="20"/> poor a penny—it's enough to make you take to begging, in order to keep in her
       hand. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Sans doute.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
      <p>By the bye, is it true, sir, that Mr. and Mrs. Lascelles were a runaway match?—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Oh, yase.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
      <p>And that her father, poor gentleman, is afflicted with blindness?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>C'est vrai—he is blind; and she run away and leave him in de <hi>dark.</hi></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
      <p>But she ran away with her husband; and a woman, you know, must leave all and cleave to
       him.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>C'est vrai—and she do cleave to him—like blister.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
      <p>And I was told, in addition, by Mr. Prong—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Monsieur Prong?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>De rascal—den I've caught him!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
      <p>And who is going to do everything for our village— going to make it a great place, sir—a
       place that, he says, will leave everything behind it.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p> Sans doute—and how generous; for when he go away, he leave noting behind him. He is great
       ge-noose; he build great room; hang him up in de air, and how you tink he climb to him? dere
       is his ladder. <stage>(he draws out a long bill)</stage> Ah   le scelerat, la voleur, I cash
       him at last. I will first go to Marie, den go to him and take all he got, if he have not one
       shelling. Bon jour, madame;—which way to dis rascal—no, no; I mean Monsieur Lascelles? </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
      <p>Ah, I'll shew you, sir;—you leave the beach on the left, turn up Elm Lane, and then, sir,
       you see—</p>
      <stage>   She goes off with Bitaube, dirceting him through R. C.</stage>
     </sp>
     <stage>Bulkly enters in a great coat, travelling handkerchief, &amp;c., followed by Rawdon,
      through L. C.</stage>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p><stage> (R.)</stage> Now, Mr. Rawdon, we're alone, relieve me from my suspense. Since the
       receipt of your letter, I've not had a moment's rest. My nephew writes to me a fortnight
       since to say he's ill, at Cherbourg. When you inform me I'm imposed on—that he's here,
       plunging in every gaiety, and connected with a French woman— </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p> <stage>(L.)</stage> It's the truth, sir, though you've yet to know it all. The female in
       question, he met at Jersey; and I regret to say, that such was her fascination— </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>He seduced her.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>You must prepare yourself for worse news.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>Great heaven, sir, speak out.</p>
      <pb n="21"/>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>In a word, then, he has married her.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>Married her?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Even so, sir—three weeks since, in France—from whence he brought his partner here.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>You must be jesting.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>I knew what a blow 'twould be to you, and so feared to reveal it suddenly; but he has
       certainly this excuse,   that in the whole business he has been mad—the girl has all the arts
       peculiar to a Frenchwoman—and she has robbed him of his reason.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>The monstrous villain! after all his vows, his oaths to his poor cousin—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>I assure you, sir, I urged every warning I could think of.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>I had borne enough before—had forgiven enough; led on by the daily hope that however
       reckless hitherto, he had still some heart, some gratitude—but this exceeds all, ends all—
       yes, now I've done with him, he's no longer kin of mine, I disown, I renounce him
       utterly.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <stage> (aside)</stage>
      <p>That will not do either.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>From this day he's a beggar, he shall starve, sir, starve! that little corrective may bring
       to his senses; if the lavish waste of wealth has dried up all his feeling, want may set them
       flowing—want may teach this profligate, that there are principles and duties not to be
       outraged with impunity.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Whilst all this while I believe, sir, his cousin is deeply attached to him.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>Attached to him, she adores him; I shouldn't at all wonder if this news were to break her
       heart.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Then, as that's the case, sir, do you think it politic to renounce him?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>Politic!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>   Since, as I'm certain that his passion for this girl is only temporary—that indeed it's
       too thorough an infatuation to be lasting.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>But he is married!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Well he is, sir, and at the same time he is not; he was united to her by a French
       priest—but as the ceremony has not been repeated by a clergyman—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>It's illegal.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>It's illegal!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <stage> (after a pause)</stage>
      <p>Well, if I were inclined to pardon him, 'twould be only for that poor child's sake.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Then for her sake, sir, let me persuade you to be lenient on this occasion—his present
       error may be a warning to amend him for the future—and—</p>

      <p>Why, at present, sir, he's engaged in this regatta.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>There—there's a fellow, ruin hanging over him, and yet joining in a sailing-match; it is as
       you say, he must be mad, sir, he must be mad!</p>

      <p>Who's that?—a visitor?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, sir; new to-day.</p>

      <p> <stage> (aside)</stage> He must be rich—he looks so surly; the very man to be attacked.
       <stage>(crosses to C.)</stage> Good morning to you,   sir. Well, sir, and what do you think
       of our regatta? </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>As of any other nonsense, sir, in which one fool wastes his money, and a hundred more their
       time.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p> Oh, I see you're not aquatic; you prefer the safer sports of land, the pleasures of an
       assembly room—precisely
       <pb n="23"/> my own tastes, sir, so as I project one in this locality—I trust you will allow
       me to put you down for a dozen shares! </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>One word first—you spoke of Mr. Lascelles.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>My friend Lascelles, of course,—a very superior fellow, sir! and would be twice as good as
       he is, if it wasn't for an old hunks of an uncle.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>Indeed!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, sir—a miserable skinflint, that stints him of common necessaries—screws him down to a
       single shilling,— however, we shall be even with him some day—he'll give a guinea to some
       hospital, and die of apoplexy, at the thought of it, and then we shall screw him down.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>Bless my soul!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong,</speaker>
      <p>Not, but what I should like to meet him first, I must say—to punish such a fellow is to
       offer atonement to society— I certainly should like to see whether this old crab could endure
       forcing.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>And forcing—to what end, sir?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>First let me ask, sir, what are your views in regard to watering places?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>   Watering places?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Yes sir,—are you not of opinion that in our present state of civilization—in the
       high-wrought, and over-worked condition of the British mind—these retreats along our shores
       are necessary outlets for that super-abundant steam which might otherwise expand, and burst
       the national boiler.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>Well, sir—it's just possible.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Very good—then you must know, sir, that solely with a view to prevent such a catastrophe,
       I've been trying all my life to open such a safety valve, and have fixed on begining here; a
       lovely country, a glorious sea, offering every scope to philanthropic views—wanting only the
       presiding mind to give their elements cohesion, and therefore, sir, feeling as I do assured—
       that all this great moral and intellectual good can only be accomplished by means of an
       assembly room,—I trust you'll support me in the one I mean to build, and allow me to put you
       down for a dozen shares—one pound deposit.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>Sir.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>No second call to be made till the first one is spent.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>No, sir.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Or perhaps you'd prefer to become a donor to the scheme.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>Nothing of the kind.</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Lascelles appears at door through R., followed by some Sailors.</stage>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Well, my lads, you worked the boat bravely; so come up to my house to-night, and make
       yourselves welcome.</p>
      <pb n="24"/>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Sailors.</speaker>
      <p>   Aye, aye, sir.</p>
      <stage>   They go off at back, R.</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p> <stage> (advancing, C.)</stage> Now then, for this stranger who Rawdon says is enquiring
       for me. <stage>(recognizing him)</stage> Good heavens—my uncle! </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p> (R.) Yes, sir, it is I! </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p> <stage> (aside, L.)</stage> Phew! old save-all! lost a shareholder I'm afraid, well, can't
       be helped; Lascelles, my boy, I see you've business, so I'll leave you.
       <stage>(aside)</stage> Very awkward really to insult the man so grossly as to tell him his
       own character. <stage>  (he goes off at back through R., Lascelles stands paralyzed)</stage>
      </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>Well, sir, you are silent?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, sir, I feel—I—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>Are you not a precious reprobate?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>I own it.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>A cheat! a knave! a villain!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>All, sir.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>An accomplished hypocrite! a calculating deceiver, whom no oath can bind, and no benefits
       make grateful!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>I admit it—every word.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>What have I not done to advance your welfare?— what not forgiven to awake affection?—but
       all in vain, sir—all in vain; you now stand before me as the perpetrator of an act—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Which, if I cannot justify, I still may palliate. Oh, sir, if ever the end could justify
       the means, be assured, guilty as I have been, I am not without excuse; that I do possess a  
       plea, which even you might own the force of. Do not suppose, sir, I would have broken faith
       with you and challenged your displeasure, had I not believed that the being to whom I bound
       myself, was worthy of your esteem—and so dared hope that, however angered with me for a time,
       a day would come, when—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>Have you finished?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, sir.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>Then, hear my answer.—Were I to consult my own feelings, we should part this very instant;
       but for the sake of one, whose happiness is almost as dear to me as existence, I'll make one
       more concession;—you possess your cousin's heart, who believes you to be faithful to her—and
       she, I am assured, is the only person who will ever make you a reputable man;— now, sir, on
       condition that you return to town with me to-night, and fulfil your word to her—I'll once
       more forgive you.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>And desert my wife?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>Your mistress!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lasce.</speaker>
      <p>Mr. Bulkley!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>What else, sir—you've married her only by a priest?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>True, sir; but I intended—</p>
      <pb n="25"/>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>To obtain a clergyman if I consented—to cast her off if I did not?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>You are my uncle, sir,—and have the power to wound me as you please. But you will admit at
       least, that I am bound   to her in honour?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>And you to talk of honour?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Well then, by a higher tie—humanity!—she believes herself my wife—in that belief has left
       her home with me—and now that she is here—in a strange land—and without friends —I ask you in
       all honesty, would it be a human act to leave her?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>I'm not, sir, to be made answerable for your misdeeds —her sufferings must fall on your
       head, and if they should fill you with remorse, 'twill perhaps make you more considerate how
       you inflict them for the future—now hear my final words. I'm going to the Inn—where I shall
       order my chaise to be got ready; and if within one hour you are not there to accompany
       me—live for the future as you please—to me you are a stranger.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>But, sir, for the love of heaven—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bulk.</speaker>
      <p>Not a word. I give you now one hour to reflect— decide as you think proper.</p>
      <stage>   He goes out at the back, through L.</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Am I living—breathing—thinking?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter Rawdon, from the back, through R.</stage>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p> Well, Lascelles, as I feared—he has found you out —and what does he say? (L.) </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p> <stage>(R.)</stage> Why, would you think it? he'd have me sacrifice my poor confiding
       Marie, merely because I have not yet complied with a certain form in England;—he despises—
       calls her my mistress—she, who is in thought as pure as heaven—and to me the truest wife.
      </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Then, I suppose you'll not resign her.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>   Resign her! I'd beg—dig—starve first.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>I'm afraid in those pursuits you'll find a deal of competition.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Well, come what will—you know my resolution.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>And such being the case—may I ask, how you intend to live?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>To live!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Virtue, you know, must eat,—however pure, it has an appetite,—do you know any way of
       earning a subsistence?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Not at present—but I could do something—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>What?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Why, my education has been good—I could go to London, which is always a great market for
       the intellectual— and—write.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p> Write! what—at the impulse of your wants,— when hundreds there are starving on the
       products of their
       <pb n="26"/> genius—the public pays for talent, not necessity—you're a likely man, certainly,
       to be contented with a garret—scribble your fingers off for bread—and bear rags, hunger, and
       insult, without the love of fame,—you, the spoilt child of luxury— who've never known a want.
      </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>And yet, in a good cause, sir, I could endure the worst.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Well, if you could, would you doom your wife to it?—this girl that you pretend to
       love,—would you have her sit   by your side in some back attic—sharing your bad dinner, and
       your worse temper?—and wasting, like the light you scribbled by, before your very eyes!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>This is an extreme case.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Whereas, if you left her, as your uncle wishes— you could provide for her in comfort,
       and—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>I'd die, before I'd leave her.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p> Very well, then the matter's settled—don't blame me, however, if I advise what I think the
       best, and— <stage>(going to the door, he stops)</stage> Eh! why Lascelles, who's that upon
       the beach?—isn't it our old friend, Samuels? </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Who?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Of Fetter Lane—it is. Why, who can he be after? any friend of yours?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Very likely.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>You're sure, it's not yourself!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Me?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Yes—for now I remember—there were those bills of yours for a thousand, due on the
       tenth.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>But my uncle paid them.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Are you sure of that? What was your agreement? He said he'd take them up if you were in
       London on the first, but as you thought fit to break your word, why might not he?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>And till this moment never was this thought of.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>   However, he may have been more generous; and—</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>(a Voice outside, through R.)</stage>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Voice.</speaker>
      <p>Have you seen Mr. Lascelles this way?</p>
     </sp>

      <p>Eh! he's asking for you.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>I am lost then; lost!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Unless indeed—a certain person at the inn—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>He give me his aid—yes, yes; on one condition.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>I don't know that; perhaps he'd settle this affair as a sort of parting present.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Ah! if he would.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>We can but try it; so I'll take the Jew down to him.</p>

      <p>Rawdon—you're my only friend.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>But remember, if he consents, you'll thank him for his kindness.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>I'll fall down at his feet.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Very well. Then expect me at your house in half an hour.</p>

      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>From what a dream do I awake. What can I say to Marie—how tell her, as I soon must, that I
       have bound her to a beggar? Will it not crush her hopes—her happiness; will it not fill her
       heart with shadows deep as those of death itself?</p>

      <p>He will be with us to-night, he says, at eight. Oh, Edward! a week ago I thought my heart

       when my wish is so young—so strong. <stage>(crosses, R.)</stage> Oh, Edward! I'm sorry now
       your friends will come to-night, I would be alone; I would not move or speak; but sit between
       you both, holding your   hands upon my breast, and saying now—'tis joy enough to live. </p>

       upon earth; oh, can
       <pb n="28"/> I sustain so great a weight of joy? By his side, and by yours to see our days
       glide by; bright and tranquil as the waters that flow before our door. Like them to pass in
       sunshine, and like them—when time is spent, to melt into the great ocean that welcomes us to

      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p> Awkward certainly, my losing the uncle; if I could only have got the old boy into my
       building, I'd have made him put on the roof. Well, I suppose I shall succeed
       to-night—especially if I take time and attack them after supper;—wonderful how defenceless
       people become after supper. In protecting their stomachs they lay bare their pockets—like the
       action of a pump—they fill in to pour out. But if I should fail, then I have but one more
       resource; I must adopt the domestic method of arriving at capital—there's Mrs. Lascelles'
       waiting-maid, daughter of a farmer, close by—I hear will have five hundred pounds on the day
       of her marriage—why, that's a fortune—an absolute fortune; I must try my luck there, and try
       it to-night —I must propose to that young woman a superior investment, to advance the amount
       for my rooms, and take me as security. <stage>(loud knocking, L.)</stage> Eh! they are
       arriving, so I'll enter and who knows if I should meet my good angel, but I may hear her

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>How? why, in the most honourable spirit of exchange. Didn't you agree to board me
       gratuitously, on condition that I recommended to you a dozen people of fashion?</p>
     </sp>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>You owe him, Monsieur Prong, and 'tis your duty to pay him.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>My duty?—that's a good joke!—you to talk about duties, who live by evading them! If I do
       owe you anything, I oughtn't to pay you for—constitutional reasons.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>What, sare?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>No, sir, and I'll prove it: ain't you a smuggler, a defrauder of the revenue? and what's
       living on you for nothing but avenging the cause of morality?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Good heaven!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, sir; visiting on you the indignation of the law!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>But you eat my bread, and you drink my brandy.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>   But 'twas contraband brandy—and all I did was to confiscate it.</p>
     </sp>

      <p>De world is at an end!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>However, to shew you I'm not ill-natured, I'll settle my account with you, and I'll tell
       you the way. You must know, I haven't given up my assembly rooms—by the bye, did you ever pay
       your deposit?—Yes, I mean to build them here; but as money's rather scarce, here's a bill of
       a friend of mine for eighty pounds—which, if you'd like to cash—you can deduct your fifteen,
       and hand me the difference.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>What, sare?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>You can give me, I say, the sixty-five difference, and—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Why, you joke!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Or if that's not convenient could you manage fifty?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>Sare, I want my bill.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Well, then, would twenty-five suit you?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
      <p>My bill, sare, if you please.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Well, then, I don't wish to be hard upon you—will you lend me a pound?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>Well, I was surprised myself, but the truth is, his rage was over—and when he came to think

      <p>Yes—</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>And is he not your friend?</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Of course; but the truth is—now I could not meet him—I want composure.</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>In half that time I'll be prepared; you forget what   our meeting is to be—that I'm to take
       leave of a man who has reared me from my cradle—who has been to me more than father.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p> Well, I know 'twill be sad enough, <stage>(crosses, L.)</stage> so come in doors and

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p> Yes, Rawdon, I want that; nothing but a strange fire—a false courage, can strengthen my

      <p>Well, John, have you brought the nosegay? Bless me, what a beauty! why it's fit for a

      <p> <stage> (rises)</stage> No, no, it is too monstrous. <stage>(crosses to L.)</stage> Too

      <p>What, to thank him for having saved you from a jail!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>No; to repay him for that aid—seek not to conceal your aim; you would tear me from her. </p>

      <p> Use your own will, but do your duty now <stage>(aside)</stage> —this will tell Marie

     <stage>—Interior of an Assembly Room. A bare wooden building, with doors, R. and L.; over which
      are painted, R. supper room; L., “Card Room”—a door at the back opens on the high road; bills
      hung about the walls headed “Assembly Rooms, Charles Claude Prong, Esq.</stage>

      doors.</stage>

      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Dear, dear, what a life people lead who've got to work for the public—to be servant of
       everyone, and mistress of nobody. I thought when this place was building, I was going to be a
       lady—that I should have nothing to do but to wear a nice dress, and give orders all day; I
       never supposed I was going to order myself—I was to be head of the establishment, but such a
       one as this is just like a canal boat—it's head and tail are both the same; and it will be
       worse when the rooms open—then I shall have to help fill 'em, as well as keep 'em clean—sell
       the tickets, and make the tea; well, there's certainly one comfort, I shan't have to drink
       it.</p>
      <stage>Rawdon enters from the road in a great coat, handkerchief, &amp;c.</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Good evening, young woman—do you know if there's a boat about here going to France,
       to-night?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>To France, sir?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, I wished to be there by the morning, and— why, it must be—didn't you live with Mr.
       Lascelles?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>To be sure I did, sir.</p>
      <pb n="35"/>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Three months ago?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, sir; but I've been married since then, to one of Mr. Lascelles' friends.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Indeed! Who was that?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Mr. Prong, sir; proprietor of this assembly room.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Why, you surprise me!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Well, of course, sir, I know he's much above me—he   being a gentleman, and I only a
       farmer's daughter; but the fact is, sir, I had a little money, and he wishing to build—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>He wanted a partner, and so took you in?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Exactly so, sir.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Well, Mrs. Prong, this was a sad business, your master's running off?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Sad, sir? it was very infamous—to desert my poor misses only a month after her marriage—and
       that, too, on the very day her old father came to see her!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>I grant it.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>To leave her—poor lady!—in a strange country, scarcely able to speak English—and all,
       merely because he'd got a rich cousin.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>'Twas a hard fate, certainly. And what became of her? I suppose her father took her home
       with him?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>He took her to Southampton, sir, but there, after a bit, he fell ill and died; and as my
       misses was then destitute and had no home to go to—I did not think it too much to take her
       into mine.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Into yours?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, sir—I couldn't see her want—besides she was so ill—she no sooner crossed our door,
       than she was forced to take to her bed; and for six weeks or more, I never thought she'd quit
       it—and though it's true, she was able yesterday to crawl abroad for half-an-hour, yet—ah!
       sir, I wouldn't be the   man who has caused all this misery—he may have gained all he
       wished—he may have got a rich wife—and be living in grandeur —but I can't think he's
       happy—after the wrong he has done,— such people may have their carriages—their wine, and fine
       dresses —but, unless they can stop thinking—they can't but fear the time will come, when they
       themselves will get served—just as they have treated others.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <stage> (calls outside)</stage>
      <p>Susan—Susan.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Ah! that's my husband—you'll excuse me, if you please, sir. </p>
      <stage>(she goes out at back, C.)</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p> She spoke home—I could have almost sworn she knew my history—I was the chief means of that
       girl's desertion, and now, what is the result—I am myself discarded—yes, Marie, yes—you have
       not gone unrevenged—blighted as you are—the weapon that was raised against you, has recoiled
       on
       <pb n="36"/> its employer. And to be renounced by the man I had served— that I had saved,
       even from ruin;—whatever my conduct was to her, to him, at least 'twas friendly—yet, now to
       be compelled to fly from England, almost for my life—because he refuses to advance a sum
       that— <stage>Prong enters in a cap and apron, with brush, C.</stage> </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Good evening, sir, a thousand apologies for this dishabille, but on the eve of opening a
       great establishment you konw the confusion. The fact is, I had employed an artist to decorate
       my exterior, but found him so deficient in that delicacy of touch as well as breadth of
       expression that forms so nice   a point of art—in the department of white-washing—I was
       obliged to dismiss him; and, however awkwardly it may sound, sir, to white-wash myself.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Old friend, do you forget me?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Is it possible, Rawdon! Well, I'm vastly glad to see you,—so here I am you see, fixed at
       last; the great object of my life accomplished—my assembly rooms erected.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>So—I perceive.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>And with every arrangement to ensure their prosperity. Here is my supper room—there my card
       room—and yonder is my orchestra, capable of holding ten instruments besides the big drum—on
       that point I am strong. My band, especially in its brasses, is wholly unequalled; I believe
       that my brass, sir, is not to be matched—and as to our strings— you hear of musical chords
       that pull in the public; put my strings together, and they are as strong as a rope, sir.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Well, I am sorry I can't stay to hear them.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Oh, but you must stay, if its only in justice to me. I'm not only manager and musical
       conductor, I'm also composer. Great occasions, you know, develope great powers: the opening
       of my rooms required to be marked by a new overture—so I walked about for half an hour, and
       whistled a grand one.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Whistled it?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Whistled it—to Stoggings, my leader, and he says it's a masterpiece. Its particular merit
       lies in its power of description,   and on this head I don't think music has ever gone
       further. As, for instance, I call it “The Fall of Algiers,” and I commence with the sailing
       of the fleet—a pizzicato movement for the hoisting of the sails—and a solo on the trumpet to
       suggest the bosn's whistle. In part three, I describe the old admiral—an adagio movement to
       depict the moral qualities of a nautical commander—and I wind it all up with a modern
       imitation of a terrible bombardment—the whistling of bullets—the bawling of sailors—the
       neighing of horses—the crowiug of cocks—the downfall of the Turks—and the triumph of British
       principles.</p>
      <pb n="37"/>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>An expressive composition, certainly.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Then allow me to put you down for a front seat.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Why, I must be off to-night—and therefore—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>You'll prefer taking tickets—very good—four shillings each—or a family packet—six for a
       guinea. </p>
      <stage>(pulls out tickets)</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Well, really, Prong, I should not object, but—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>You think I ought to put you on my free list—well, as you're an old friend, I don't
       object—but I must tell you one thing—it's suspended for the season.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Markland.</speaker>
      <stage> (heard outside, C.)</stage>
      <p>No, thank you, I'll step in.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Eh! who's coming? Ah! it's Markland.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Markland!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Yes; and by the bye, that reminds me he has a dinner-party to-day, and I have promised that
       the band shall play my overture to the company.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>   Well, I must delay no longer; my friend, I must tell you I am in haste to get to
       France;—is there a boat about here, going off to-night?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>I dare say there is. Come through this room—it opens on my garden. And so you are going to
       France, eh? Well, now, how very odd—for, do you know, you've never paid up your two shares;
       so, whilst I send a boy down to the beach to enquire, you can hand me the difference.</p>
      <stage>   They go off by the door, R. 2 E.</stage>
      <stage>Markland and Susan come from the road, C.</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mark.</speaker>
      <p>Well, Susan, and how is your poor friend to-day?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Why, thank you, sir, I think she's a little stronger.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mark.</speaker>
      <p>Then, in a week or so; we may hope to see her reestablished?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>No, sir,—I don't say that.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mark.</speaker>
      <p>But I say it—and with reason. Susan, I bring her news, that would almost raise her from the
       grave. I know, and cannot condemn your indignation at your late master. His treachery fully
       justified the abhorence you've expressed, but still he had excuses—it was not pride as you
       suppose, but want that caused his treachery. He loved your mistress deeply, but if he could
       only prove his truth to her at the hazard of a prison —must not some excuse be found for him
       in his dismay and his despair?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Why, certainly, sir.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mark.</speaker>
      <p> Be assured, Susan, that from the day he left her he has not known a moment's peace; his
       life has been but a protracted torture—hourly she has been before him, in all her  
       desolation; and she not only—but the seared look of her poor deserted father. His one prayer
       has been to atone to her, and at length that prayer is granted—he had told his story to his
       <pb n="38"/> cousin, a good and generous girl, and she had released him from his contract—but
       still his uncle was unyielding and resolved on its completion. For three months that girl
       entreated him, and entreated him in vain—but love like hers was not to be defeated, within
       this week she has prevailed—Lascelles is pardoned—and is free to maintain his vows to Marie.
       <stage>(Rawdon opens the R. door returning, and seeing them, pauses)</stage> </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>And—and is he coming, sir?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mark.</speaker>
      <p>He is here; now at the Inn—where I had the greatest labour to detain him—whilst I went in
       search of you to prepare her for the meeting.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Why, I really don't know whether I'm asleep or awake?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mark.</speaker>
      <p>Now, lose no time, but run to her immediately, and mind you are discreet—do not tell her
       all—say merely, he is returned, and begs to see her.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>I will, sir.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mark.</speaker>
      <p>Be speedy, then, or perhaps this meeting which promises such good, may become but the
       parent of augmented suffering.</p>
      <stage>   He goes out at back, C.</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Mr. Lascelles come back! come back to my poor misses to make her his true and lawful wife!
       I must be dreaming—yet—no Mr Markland says so—and I know he wouldn't   deceive me, ha! ha!
       oh! isn't this delightful! I'm so happy —I—I—should like to cry, only I haven't time—and yet
       here I stand idling, when I ought to run and tell her—never mind the rooms—if they don't open
       for a month—I've got to wash the floor—but my husband can do that—and then go home, and fry
       some sausages—but he can do that too.—Dear, dear—only let me see her once more happy—and I
       don't think I should be wretched, if I was to bury Mr. Prong.</p>
      <stage>   She runs off, at the back, C.</stage>

      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <stage> (advances)</stage>
      <p>So, then, Lascelles is free—and has returned to requite his victim. Are there not two here
       he should requite? Why should I leave England, seeking beggary abroad to avoid punishment at
       home—when he, who was the cause of my imprudence—can save me from its consequence? What made
       me use his name, but his own breach of faith to me? And with a hundred pounds I could regain
       the bill—he is now as rich as ever, and must assist me, eh—is not that he approaching? Yes;
       he has broken away from Markland, and hurries here half mad with joy, to clasp the feet of
       his forsaken—well, be it so—let hers be the first meeting—mine shall be the second.</p>
      <stage>   He retires by, R. door.</stage>
      <stage>Susan returns from the road, C.</stage>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p> She is not at home—I had forgot that—and also—
       <pb n="39"/> heaven keep me—I was so surprised and overjoyed, I totally forgot to tell Mr.
       Markland, the state of my poor misses' mind—I have kept it secret, hoping every day she'd
       mend— but now, Mr. Lascelles is come, I must tell him, and yet how can I tell him, what will
       he say, or do, when he discovers that— <stage>Lascelles is heard without, C.</stage> </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>   Marie! Marie!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Gracious powers! he's at the door.</p>
      <stage>Lascelles rushes in, at back.</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Marie—are you here?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, sir, I suppose so.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>And does not know my voice?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Well, perhaps, sir,—she is not within—she may have left the house.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>And which way—tell me—that I may reach her side at once.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Which—which way, sir?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Why, what's this? Markland's not deceived me— she is well.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Oh, yes, sir—she is well.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Then, why do you hesitate?—why hold back from me some news? which I can see, but too
       plainly shadowed in your face—when you know all that's past—when you know too why I am
       here—is she alive?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Oh, yes, sir, and as I said well, but do be composed, sir, do now—you—you heard she's been
       very ill—for six weeks we gave her over—and though it's true she's now about again, of course
       she's very weak.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Of course.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>And if so in her body—she must be in her mind.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Her mind?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, sir, you know what a shock it was—the night   you went away—she was so happy at her
       father's coming—and you appeared so kind—and—and—altogether it was so sudden —and so
       terrible, that—</p>
      <stage>  (She pauses—he recoils—gathering her meaning)</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>You,—you do not mean to say, that—that her mind has given way?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <stage> (bursting into tears)</stage>
      <p>It has indeed, sir.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Almighty heaven!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>For a time, I thought it was only brought on by her fever, and I hoped, when her strength
       returned, her reason would come with it.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>No, no, you cannot—dare not—blast me with a thought so horrible!</p>
      <pb n="40"/>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Indeed, sir, it's the truth.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>It cannot be—a momentary weakness—a casual word or action has deceived you.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Oh, sir, I wish it were so, but haven't I watched her a week? Why, sir, she believes, that
       the evening on which you left her is still passing—that your friends are all assembled —and
       that you, whom she saw enter a carriage at the gate— will speedily return to them.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>What say you?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Yesterday, when she went abroad, she passed the whole day by the roadside, looking for your
       approach—and as she came back disappointed, she rose this morning, believing that you'd come
       to-day.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>   Then it's plain if she beheld me—my presence would restore her.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Why, sure enough, it might, sir—I never thought of that.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>It must, Susan—where is she now?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Sitting by the road, sir, I'll run for her directly—wait here only a moment, and—Eh! as I
       live, she is here.</p>
      <stage>Marie enters, her bonnet in her hand—she advances without observing them.</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Marie.</speaker>
      <p> Susan! Susan!—he is not come. And now, he will not return to-night, I am sure—I'm
       sorry—for our friends will look for him—and my father too, how sad he'll be—well—well never
       mind, he'll be sure to return to-morrow, so we must prepare —are the rooms ready—the music,
       and the lights. <stage>(looks round)</stage> Yes—yes, tout est beau! all is charming!—so now
       I'll go, and dress—come, Susan, come— <stage>  (she turns and goes to L. door—Lascelles,

      <speaker>Marie.</speaker>
      <p>Edward! I beg your pardon, he is not returned— he left me an hour ago to fulfil some errand
       at Southampton; but he will be back soon—very soon, long before the evening's over. </p>
      <stage>(he approaches her—she remains unconscious)</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Marie!—do you not know me yet? What! not me—your own—your dearest—your espoused!</p>

      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>   Marie, though your mind may be estranged, is there no chord within your soul to vibrate
       to my voice—to thrill at the name of Edward?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Marie.</speaker>
      <p> Edward!—you know him, sir? Ah! is he not
       <pb n="41"/> worthy of your esteem? so generous, so good—if I could say how much he loves me.
       How assured I am that to save me from one hour's pain, he would sacrifice his life! </p>

       <stage>(Music.—Turning from him, she goes round the room, bowing to imaginary couples, and

      <p>And I have wrought this ruin! I, that professed to love, to honor, and protect her!</p>

      <p>You'll now, I suppose, sir, go to Mr. Markland's?</p>

      <p>Certainly.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>To meet his friends at dinner?</p>

      <p>Of course.</p>

      <p>To-morrow.</p>
     </sp>

      <p>To-morrow, why, bless my soul, I'm afraid he's   going crazy too—Mr. Lascelles, do speak to

     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>Well, Susan, what alarms you?</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>'Twill be getting dark, and as you must cross the fields to Mr. Markland's, hadn't I better
       show you the way? Since you were here, some chalk pits have been dug, and the path runs very
       near them, so I'll put you in the road. Now, you must not be disheartened, sir, because she
       didn't know you at once; when she sees you frequently, and hears you speak, and speak so
       kindly,—her reason must return, it must, indeed, sir!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, when he that has bereaved it, is resting in his grave!</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p> This is fortunate, he means to cross the fields, the place of all others for our meeting;
       there we should have privacy, and time to talk. Yes, Lascelles, little as you look for me
       to-night—our difference bids fair to be adjusted! <stage>   He goes after him.</stage>
       <pb n="42"/> Scene II. <stage>—The Chalk Pits at dusk. The fields stretch away in the
       distance, through which runs the high road; the pits lie at the back, edged by a low bank,
       and crossed by a plank, running off, R. U. E.; a pathway runs up a bank, L. U. E.</stage>

      <p>Non, non, il n'est pas arrivé; Susan, he will not come to-night, I'm sure not. Ah! is it
       not sad, when all our friends are here, when my father desires so much to see him, well—well,
       it can't be helped; he'll come to-morrow, yes—he's sure to come to-morrow, so we must go on;
       is all ready, the music, and the flowers, and Susan—Susan—</p>

      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Here are the chalk pits, sir, you cross them by that plank, it's quite safe, sir—and when

      <p>Good night, sir, we shall see you again to-morrow, then? keep up your spirits, sir—now, do,

       frequently.</p>
     </sp>

      <p>Marie, Marie! is not this at least atonement—ever to be by your side, yet ever to be
       unknown to you—ever to implore your pardon, yet win from you no reply—to meet nothing but
       your sad smile and your trust—the deeper condemnation of your own unchanged affection.</p>

      <p>Who's this?</p>

      <p>And why have we met again?</p>

      <p>Well, sir.</p>
     </sp>

      <p>When it is simply this—your name appended to a scrap of paper, to obtain a sum which you
       were pledged to lend me.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>But a sum, as I told you, that I was not possessed of.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>At any rate, you led me into the error, and 'tis your duty to repair it, I can't return to
       town—I want money to take me elsewhere, you are now rich again, and can lend me a hundred
       pounds.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>And you beg this of me?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Beg this! I demand it. You ask me to speak plainly—and why not, when I'm injured?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Injured! villain! Who, but you tore me from the arms of Marie?—do you know that she is now
       a maniac?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>And if so—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>   Then, in that blow—know that you crushed two minds—so, if you rob men of their reason,
       beware how you provoke them.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>You refuse, then, to assist me?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Assist you? There's not a reptile, venomous and loathsome, that could crawl across my path,
       I would not sooner stoop to succour.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>Beware, Lascelles!—you know that men are not exposed to want, without the power to overcome
       it.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>So, then, you're now grown honest?—you would at last rob openly?</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
      <p>And I; so you see we're still even, in everything but need. Again, I ask you—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Then take this for my answer: be found here by to-morrow, and the prison you have fled from
       shall not forego its due.</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>No, your betrayer!—your enemy, and mine!</p>

      <p>No, no; you must not harm him, for he loves me.</p>

      <p> Marie! my preserver! <stage>   She surveys him with a gleam of recollection, utters a low
       scream, and falls into his arms—Susan descends the path, L.—Scene closes in.</stage> Scene
       III. <stage>—An Apartment at Markland's.</stage> <stage>Prong enters, L., with a roll of
       music, followed by a Servant.</stage> </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Mr. Markland at home?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Servant.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, sir.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>Then will you tell him, if you please, that the band has arrived?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Servant.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, sir.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>And, moreover, that on this occasion, Mr. Prong will conduct the overture.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Servant.</speaker>
      <p>Very good, sir.</p>
      <stage>   Servant goes off, L. 1 E.</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p> And if that doesn't slide off a few “family packets” I am no judge of music. The fact is,
       I have found out in regard to music, that the conducting's everything; for what would the
       public know of it, if the conductor didn't explain it to them? A conductor in an orchestra,
       like one on the roof of a house—is an instrument to catch the electric fluid and transmit it
       to its recipients; I've studied in a good school; I've seen all the modern bands in London
       and in Paris, and I know all their evolutions—you always begin in this way. <stage>(he
       flourishes his roll, a la Jullien)</stage> With three good broad-sword slashes for a grand
       crash, in order to rouse attention—and then a series of gentle flutterings, like a sea gull
       going to dive—to waft the wind away into luxurious repose—presently a sudden burst, to create
       a slight perplexity—a hurry skurry of the fiddles, to make them ask, what's coming
       now—followed by a boom of the trombones, and a shriek of the French horns, as though you were
       going to   charge them with a whole jungle of wild elephants—and then
       <pb n="45"/> when you are well at work—booming, screaming, thundering, till the audience
       begin to stare like a lot of delighted bedlamites; you calm the storm, and soothe all down
       till you look as if you were sinking in a warm sea bath. <stage>(a loud knocking, L.)</stage>
       Ah! the company to dinner. I've a great mind to bring that knocker into my overture, it would
       do a bit of the bombarding capitally. <stage>Servant crosses from L. hurriedly.</stage> Told
       your master, John? </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Servant.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, sir; but I must go now to my mistress, for here's Mr. Lascelles at the door with a
       lady that's fainted.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p>A lady that's fainted?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Servant.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, sir; Mr. Lascelles has been attacked, sir; just escaped with his life, so he's brought
       the lady here, and— you'll excuse me, if you please, sir?</p>
      <stage>   He runs off, R. 1 E.</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p> Lascelles been attacked?—how very unfortunate! this will keep back the dinner half an
       hour—perhaps, too, spoil my music. My band must be in the way: I'll call them in. Gentlemen,
       will you step here, if you please? <stage>Enter three Villagers, with a fiddle, drum, and
       trumpet, L. 1 E.</stage> Gentlemen, I'm sorry to say, that owing to a little discord abroad,
       our harmony is likely to be interfered with within. However, we'll take our places on the
       lawn, and ascertain the distance at which we ought to stand. Distance, you know, has much to
       do with music—some we like near, some far off—and I wish to see, from your peculiar style of
       playing, whether yours would be most enjoyed near, or very far off. So follow   me to the
       lawn—and allow me to say—that as I'm your conductor, I allow of no stoppages. <stage>   They
       go off, R. 1 E.</stage> <stage>Enter Markland and Lascelles, L. 1 E.</stage> </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mark.</speaker>
      <p>Why, Lascelles, this story of your attack, and your rescue at the hands of Marie, sounds
       like a romance.—Let me trust, however, that the only fiction, is your belief—that her mind is
       diseased.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Have I not told you her delusion—that the evening on which I left her is still passing—that
       my friends are still assembling—and I, that she saw leave her in a carriage, am not returning
       to rejoin them.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mark.</speaker>
      <p>I see—'twas the scene on which her senses closed— and it has burnt into her brain—and oddly
       enough—to-night, that you bring her here—I have some friends to dinner, and a
       dance—and—Lascelles—a thought—what if we tested this delusion—what if we realized the
       scene—which she imagines to be passing.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>Realized it.</p>
      <pb n="46"/>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mark.</speaker>
      <p>Aye—place her in that room once more, where her reason left her—and there surround her with
       the same images, and forms—and voices—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>And then—?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mark.</speaker>
      <p>Do you not think that such a pressure on her senses, would recall them.—And fortunately, as
       this is still your old house—the attempt could be made to-night—the room is still the same—or
       here is Susan, who remembers how 'twas furnished—and   will help us to re-arrange it.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>But still—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mark.</speaker>
      <p>Nay, nay—if the scheme holds out the slightest ground of hope—'tis our duty to attempt
       it—be the issue what it may.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
      <p>I feel it is—but pardon me if struggle as I may, the thought will come—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mark.</speaker>
      <p>That after all her suffering—some joy is yet in store for her. </p>
      <stage>(they go off, L. 1 E.)</stage>
      <stage>Prong returns, R. 1 E.</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Prong.</speaker>
      <p> There—I've placed the band in a capital position— on the bank of the pond—so if they
       happen to slip in, their notes will be more liquid—and I think this is a good distance, two
       hundred yards—so here I shall try the effect of my production. I hope they'll play it with
       expression—particularly the bit about the admiral—the ten bars that describe the moral
       qualities of a good commander—by the bye—I was thinking, whether I couldn't improve that, by
       making the Admiral a Renegade—and then I could have some music to describe a man going into a
       foreign country—and changing his religion— well—they can see me here—so I'll give them the
       signal—now, gentlemen—begin. <stage>  (he stands looking off, R., and flourishes; a bray of
       discords follow from the band)</stage> Hallo! what's that?—stop, stop! <stage>  (their noise
       goes on increasing; he alternately flourishes and stops his ears, and at last rushes off to
       silence them)</stage> Scene IV. <stage>—The Parlours of the Villa (as in Scene III., Act II.,
       furnished and lit in the same manner)</stage> <stage>Susan runs in from the lawn, smartly
       dressed, (as in Act II.)</stage> </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p> Gracious me! what a thought of Mr. Markland's, to try to recover missus, by making her
       believe that the scene she is always thinking of is actually going on; it's not at all a bad
       notion, and should it succeed, she'll never know what she has suffered, or remember it only
       as a dream—and sure enough we can try it, for here we are in our old house, and the rooms
       <pb n="47"/> just as they were—not a chair changed, that I can see—everything looks the
       same;—I wonder whether I look the same! <stage>(goes to a glass)</stage> Well, pretty much,
       though to be sure, a girl's face is not so good for that matter, as a bit of
       mahogany—mahogany we know, improves by hard rubs—in fact it gets polished; but I can't say
       adversity has done as much good for me. <stage>Markland comes from R. door.</stage> </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mark.</speaker>
      <p>Now, Susan is, all in order?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, sir; perhaps this table stood a little more here, and our flower stand, I think, was
       opposite. </p>
      <stage>(she changes their places rapidly)</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mark.</speaker>
      <p>Prepare, then—for whilst lying in her stupor, my wife succeeded in transforming her; in a
       few moments she will be here; you know your lesson—but be cautious.</p>
      <stage>   He goes out at back, through R.</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p> Be cautious! that's easy advice to give, but not so easy to take, when a body is so
       flustered;—I'm sure I shall make some blunder—I shall try to do it so well—I shall be able to
       do nothing—I shouldn't at all wonder if I wasn't able to speak at all! <stage>Enter Marie,
       R., dressed as in last scene of Act II., and advances in a reverie.</stage> Ahem!—Madam!—Mrs.
       Lascelles! </p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>Marie.</speaker>
      <stage> (turning to her, coldly)</stage>
      <p>   Yes, Susan.</p>

      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p> You are dressed in time, I see—and—and—how charmingly you look to-night! Well, I am sure I
       hope Mr. Lascelles will win many sailing matches, when he makes you a present of such a
       beautiful dress as that—and oh! what a lovely bracelet—is that another gift to-day, ma'am?
       Why, the stone glitters like a star! <stage>(aside)</stage> I declare the stone has struck
       her! And that lace looks very splendid, ma'am. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Marie.</speaker>
      <p>The lace?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <stage> (aside)</stage>
      <p>And that has struck her too!—I'm almost choked—but never mind, it will be only for a
       moment—and— and—how do you like the room, ma'am? don't the lamps burn nicely?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Marie.</speaker>
      <p>The room! </p>
      <stage>(she looks round it rapidly)</stage>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Susan.</speaker>
      <p> I have placed the flowers where you told me, in the vase. <stage>  (a loud knocking at
       back, R.)</stage> Ah! just in time, ma'am—here are your friends arriving! <stage>  (Marie
       runs to the lawn, and looking off a moment returns to the foreground, and stands
       rivetted)</stage> Eh! bless my soul—I'm afraid it won't do either; she is as fixed as ever,
       ma'am—Mrs. Lascelles. <stage>  (more knocking, R.)</stage>
       <pb n="48"/> <stage>Markland enters from the lawn, with two Ladies.</stage> Mr. Markland,

      <p>   I am sure he will.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>But where's Lascelles? his friends here, and no host to receive them. Eh! isn't that a

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Marie.</speaker>
      <p>A carriage! </p>
