      <p>Call me Mrs. Goosequill, sir, the name of my first, whom I should have lamented longer.
       Poor Goosequill ! he was a man of the pen—Registrar of the village— what has made me
       unfaithful to his memory is a weakness I have for the gentlemen of the sword.</p>

      <p>I can't tell her I'm going to marry another to-morrow; it would be unbecoming an Irishman
       and a soldier. <stage>(aloud)</stage> I'll explain to you, my angelic widow. The adventurous
       life of us children of Bellona is subject to so many dangers, and as our General Marlborough
       is about to make another campaign, I cannot frustrate his chances of victory, by depriving
       him of my small amount of valour, nor expose you to a second widowhood, for such a small
       amount of the blessings of matrimony.</p>

      <p>I'm very unlucky in my attachments ; what consoles me, in this, is, that the sergeant quits
       me only for glory. —Well, if he won't marry me, I must look out for another. <stage>(looking
        at Mouldywort's house)</stage> I don't think I did quite right, in turning up my nose at Mr.
       Mouldywort, when he used to make love to me—he's not a bad match, with his well lined purse.
       I must change my treatment of him. I must endeavour to light up the old flame again. Why, I
       declare, here he comes.</p>

       neighbour, my time's my money, and can't be spent foolishly—matrimony is quite an epidemic
       this year, and as the best and only fiddler within twenty miles, my violin, my donkey, and
       myself, are kept in a perpetual motion. I'm off to a wedding party this evening, at

      <speaker>Mouldy.</speaker>
      <p>Because I like to laugh; as a fiddler, it is not forbidden. I like to spy into all the

       not a servant: and the proof is, I give her no wages. I thought it would humiliate her, poor
       girl; she was confided to me by an old cousin of mine, who brought her up, and recommended me
       to find her a good husband. The first time I shaved afterwards I had one in my intelligent
       eye, as you call it. I popped the question, and the pledge was accepted.</p>
