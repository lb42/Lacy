<head>Remarks</head>
<head>Mazeppa.</head>
<p> Lord Byron is a great and an original genius; he has a depth of thought and
a force of expression that are truly admirable. In aiming at too much
conciseness, he is often harsh and obscure, while his artificial pauses, his
rapid and sometimes unnatural transitions, give to his poetry an air of pedantry
and affectation. Upon many occasions he is exquisitely simple and pathetic ; his
simile of the <hi>Kashmeer Butterfly</hi>, and that fine passage, "<hi>He who
hath bent him o’er the dead,</hi>” cannot easily be paralleled. But it is in
“<title>Childe Harold</title>” (the greatest of all his works), that the genius
of Lord Byron shines most conspicuous—his lamentations over the ruins of Greece,
his passionate exhortations to spare the last relics of her ancient grandeur,
and his just and generous indignation against our modern vandal, for despoiling
her of what the barbarians themselves held sacred, are the very soul of pathos
and poetry. In proportion as we admire exalted genius, we lament its wanton
prostitution: the mass of obscenity and profaneness which Lord Byron has
bequeathed to posterity is now become a question between him and his Creator. He
lived too long for his own fame—we cannot say “ He should have died hereafter,”
unless (like <hi>Lord Rochester</hi>) it had been to leave on record his deep
contrition for having poisoned the minds of future generations. The following
character of Lord Byron as a poet, was written before he had inflicted upon the
world that witty, but scandalously immoral work, "<title>Don Juan</title> :”—
<l>“The town is pleas’d when Byron will rehearse, </l><l>And finds a thousand
beauties in his verse; </l><l>So fix’d his fame, that write whate’er he will,
</l><l>The patient public most admire it still; </l><l>Yes,—though bereft of
half his force and fire, </l><l>They still must read—and, dozing, must admire ;
</l><l>While you and I, who stick to common sense, </l><l>To genius, taste, and
wit, have no pretence.</l>
<pb n="6"/>
<l>Throughout the whole we toil to understand</l><l> Where’er we tread—'tis
strange, 'tis foreign land</l><l> Nay, half the thoughts and language of the
strain</l><l> Require a glossary to make them plain.</l><l> Beauties there are,
which, candour bids me own,</l><l> Atone for these—for more than these atone
:</l><l> Beauties, which e’en the coldest mast admire —</l><l> Quick,
high-wrought passion—true poetic fire—</l><l> Bold, energetic language—thoughts
sublime—</l><l> And all the artful cadences of rhyme.”</l><note place="foot"
>"The Modern Dunciad"</note>
</p>
<p> The story of Mazeppa we learn from two sources— Voltaire’s History of
Charles XII., and Lesur’s “<title>Histoire des Kosaques</title>.” Lord Byron has rendered it
familiar to any reader of poetry—Mazeppa is introduced relating romantic
adventures to the royal Swede, after the battle of Pultowa. The vanquished
monarch, wounded and reclined at the foot of a tree, surrounded by his warriors,
had singled out the brave Tartar and his steed as objects of peculiar admiration
for their prowess in ‘‘ pricking over flood or field,’’ when Mazeppa,
remembering the <hi>school</hi> in which he had acquired his skill in horsemanship,
drops an expression that raises the curiosity of Charles, who puts to the ‘‘ old
Hettman” a question that produces the recital. Lord Byron confines his narrative
to Mazeppa’s intrigue with the beautiful young wife of a Polish count, the
discovery of their amours, the revenge of the jealous husband, who sentences the
Tartar to be lashed to the back of a wild horse, and left to his fate—the
description of that perilous journey, his rescue by the Cossacks, and subsequent
good fortune. All these are told in Lord Byron’s wonted strain of eloquence and
passion. The story winds up with a versification of the ancient motto,
‘<hi>'nil desperandum.</hi>
</p>
<p>Mazeppa has found his way to the stage; with the accompaniments of
appropriate scenery, alternately savage and splendid; gorgeous processions,
dresses and decorations; gallant knights and ladies fair; banquets, tournaments,
and real horses. The story has been considerably varied and amplified, to bring
these powerful auxiliaries into full play ; and an imposing spectacle is the
result. Olinska, daughter of the Castellan, is beloved by Mazeppa, who passes
under the name of Cassimir. Her father has, however, provided a more substantial
suitor, in the person of the Count Palatine ; who, being too magnificent a
potentate to leave his palace <pb n="7"/> and lay his coronet at her feet, until
his proposals be duly accepted, despatches an envoy to propitiate her by proxy.
The lady reluctantly consents—the diadem is placed on her head—she ascends the
nuptial car, when the delighted Count, drawing aside the curtains, welcomes his
beautiful intended, and in flattering terms explains the cause of his
appearance, at once so unexpected and gallant. On the eve of the marriage,
Mazeppa secretly enters the chamber of the Count, defies him to single combat—a
battle ensues—the Count is wounded, Mazeppa retreats, an alarm is given, he is
taken, and the Castellan determines to make him an example of signal vengeance.
He orders the vile Tartar to be stripped, the fiery untamed steed is led forth,
Mazeppa is fast bound to his back, Olinska implores pity for him, but in vain;
and the wild horse, amidst the glare of torches, savage shouts, and
beacon-fires, is suddenly released. He dashes up mountains, down precipices,
fords rivers, devoting his unhappy rider to scorching suns, piercing blasts,
devouring hunger, and parching thirst. Savage wolves follow in quick pursuit and
threaten to rend him piecemeal—and a vulture hovers over his head, impatient for
its expected prey. After an accumulation of horrors, they reach Tartary. The
affrighted peasants, beholding the wild horse furiously pursuing its course,
take it fur the Volpas, which, according to a popular superstition, is a demon
form that whirls across the wilds of Tartary, foreboding death and desolation. A
thunderbolt strikes a tree, which falls to the ground—at this moment the fiery
steed sinks down exhausted—Mazeppa, apparently lifeless, extended on its body.
Abder Khan, against whom a plot exists, headed by Thamar, a rebel chief, to
drive him from his throne, enters, and beholds the wounded stranger. What signs
and characters meet his sight! a miracle has been wrought! the jewelled star,
the badge and emblem of the tribe— tis Mazeppa, his lost son! This discovery is
fatal to the scheme of Thamar, who (the Khan being old and childless) had
aspired to the regal sway. His dagger must remove this obstacle to his
anticipated greatness—he successively attempts the life of both father and son,
but is foiled in his attempts. Mazeppa recovers—recognises his father, whom he
has miraculously rescued from the dagger of the assassin and is hailed King of
Tartary. But he cannot be <pb n="8"/> without Olinska—to Poland he must repair.
for his mistress, and his majesty resolves to accompany his son on. his amorous
crusade. Mazeppa remounts the wild horse, which, after his late heat, is
surprisingly tame, and no longer the terror of grooms and rough-riders. Ounce
the instrument of torture, it is now the messenger of vengeance. The warlike
expedition moves off in triumph--reaches Poland, when the king, Mazeppa, and a
faithful chief, disguised as Tartar peasants, repair to the palace of the
Castellan, and are engaged by Drolinski, an officious officer of the household,
to perform sundry grotesque dances and dextrous feats, after the manner of their
country, in celebration of the long-delayed nuptials between the Count Palatine
(who has recovered from his wound) and Olinska, who is brought forth like a lamb
to the slaughter, her heart being with the horse and his rider. The king
contrives to wheedle Drolinsko (a huge feeder, a little fellow, and a great
fool), out of the keys of the great gates of the castle; and a chosen band of
warriors, who lie concealed in a neighbouring forest, are secretly introduced.
The nuptial procession advances with due solemnity ; a barbarous ballet is
performed; when Mazeppa, rushing forward, forbids the banns. <hi>Who</hi> is the daring
intruder ?—He throws off his disguise, proclaims his titles—the Poles and
Tartars go at it pell-mell—Mazeppa wins his bride by force of arms, and the
piece concludes amidst conflagration and rejoicings. This splendid drama was
first produced at the Royal Amphitheatre, Westminster, under the management of
Messrs. Ducrow and West, Easter, 1831; and is written by Mr. Milner, the author
of Massaniello. </p>
<p> It is but common justice to remark how effectively every piece is got up at
this theatre. The equestrian performances are without parallel in the annals of
horsemanship; and the scenery and decorations may vie with the proudest
metropolitan, </p>

<!--Cumberland’s has the spelling “Cassimer” here but also uses “Cassimir” interchangeably throughout. Payne’s version a list of fourteen characters, plus two lists of extras. Payne’s characters are: AbderKhan, Mazeppa, the Castellan of Laurinski, Premislas, Thamar, Rudziloff, Ozeb (“Tartar Warrior of the suite of AbderKhan”), Zelos (“An aged Tartar”), Drolinsko, Koskar, “Another Tartan Shepard,” Olinska, Agatha, and “Korella (A Tartar female, revered among them as a Prophet).” Payne’s extras are: “Polish Lords, Squires, Pages, Servants, Shepherds, Soldiers” and “Ladies, Shepherdesses, Etc.” Payne’s opening differs markedly in his early inclusion of horses and equestrian action at the start of the play and throughout the first scene. This places the equestrian elements, including the “Wild Horse,” very much at the center of the action in Payne’s version, which opens as follows:
               <head>SCENE I: <hi>A terrace, or open gallery, giving a view to
                         the back of the stage, which is crossed at the boundary
                         of the terrace by a balustrade high enough to lean
                         upon, beyond which appears a circular enclosure forming
                         an arena, a riding ring, for jousts and tournaments,
                         with seats ranged amphitheatrically around its remote
                         edge</hi>.</head>
               <p><hi>At the rising of the curtain</hi>, Rudzoloff, Drolinsko,
                         <hi>with several</hi> servants <hi>of the castle, are
                         discovered upon the terrace, looking on at what passes
                         in the riding ring, where several esquires and</hi>
                    huntsmen <hi>are seen preparing for exercises</hi>.</p>-->

                    He’ll frighten everybody off the ground and we shall have no
                    sport.</p>
               <p>The scripted equestrian action continues later in Scene I to
                    include “<hi>Different exercises of the manége, fencing, and

                    concludes with the “<hi>wild Tartarean Horse, which is led
                         curvetting into the middle of the circus</hi>” where he
                    throws several of the esquires as they try to
                         “<hi>master</hi>” him. Soon, the action turns to focus
                    on the developing relationship between Casimir and the
                    horse.</p>

there never was a native of that country, whether walking on one pair of legs or
two, that ever came to any good by being in a better. Look, now, at that young

on three sides by an elevated gallery - an arched entrance, C. F. under the

<stage>[Music - The galleries are filled with spectators - the limits of the
arena are maintained by Heralds and mounted Men at arms - in the centre are

begin.</p>

<stage>[Music. - The Castellan sits - Rudzoloff makes a signal, on which a
trumpet sounds, and the respective champions take their stations - first, a
small sword combat, between two of the Pages - then a tilt of mounted and armed
Knights, with spear and battle-axe, of whom Cassimir is one -then a sword combat
on horseback, between Cassimir and his opponent - in both of these Cassimir is
successful - then a broadsword combat of four, in which Cassimir is also the
victor - the conquerors advance towards the Castellan.</stage>
<sp who="castellan">

<p> Cassimir , it is with pleasure I behold you the victor: I have before

<!--This action by the horse should continue through the end of the Act and is essential to the play’s success in production.

irreverently of him, whom all our tribes revere. Ever was AbderKhan a mild and
gracious monarch; but since that fatal time, when on the fields of Poland he
lost his only son, his mind has taken a strange and solemn turn - he is inspired
by the gods of Tartary - in wondrous visions, its future destiny’s unfolded to

                              is a feat, one utilized by Astley and others in
                              earlier productions, to great effect) to be
                              lifted, laid upon the bier and lifted. The
                              discipline required of the horse to allow and
                              endure this is great, as is the intended effect of
                              the scene, (which it was when properly executed
                              and with the horse truly appearing exhausted and
                              near death). Beyond this, the implications of both
                              the horse and man being lifted and carried off are
                              significant in highlighting the transformative
                              nature of the journey, which they began as exiles,
                              cast out to die, and which now ends with them

<p> Thy child, fond dotard! The easy dupe thou art to yonder rash impostor,

contest, the Khan is overpowered, and falls - Thamar and his confederates stand
over him with uplifted weapons - during this, a sort of struggle has been
perceived at the entrance of the tent, as of some one endeavouring to force
their way in, which is successfully resisted by the two Tartars placed there -
at the moment when Thamar and the Conspirators are on the point of striking
their weapons to the heart of the Khan, the tent is slit up in another place by

rush, o’erwhelming all resistance, to the aid of those that are within. I will
be on the spot; and, at the moment when the perjured fair would offer her
unhallowed vows upon <pb n="48"/> the sacred altar, my steel shall drink the
life-blood of them both, and their mingled gore proclaim the vengeance of my
outraged love. [<stage>Music heard without</stage>,] See, see, where the

not yet arrived.</p>

buried in another’s tomb - soon, soon may I go seek him there.</p>

<p> But this dejection scarce fulfils your promise to your father - all was to
be submission.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="olinska">

<p> It is submission, nurse – submission I have learned by trampling on every
feeling of my heart. I shall obey my father - let him not require more than I
can perform.</p>

<sp who="drolinsko">
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p> [<stage>Approaching Olinska.</stage> ] Lord love your beautiful ladyship,
you’ll be delighted when you see the preparations for the fete, solely contrived
by me, Drolinsko. Why, it’s worth while being married, if only to see such a
tasty set-out - you’ll be half inclined to love me for the cultivated fancy I
have displayed.</p>

</sp>
<sp who="drolinsko">

<p> Ah! that’s another of my contrivances, that you’d never suspect, godfather.
Those, why those, bless you, are wandering Tartars, introduced by me.</p>

<p> Tartars! introduce Tartars here! why, it’s more than your head’s worth - let

<p> Ay, it’s plain to see you’re a fellow of no pith and enterprise. He may
think what he likes about Tartars, but if these fellows don’t caper him into

household, was a countryman of yours, I believe.</p>

<p> Belike, fair lady, I do bethink me of a tale of a poor Tartar lad, bred up
in Polish climes, who rashly loved a noble lady – ‘twas a fault in him, but oh!
who ever looked upon that fair one’s beauty and her worth, must have forgiven
him, knowing that to see and not to love was scarcely possible. Her father found
it in him a crime not to be pardoned, and sentenced him to a most cruel
death.</p>

<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>[Muttering.]</stage> It was, indeed, most horrible.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="mazeppa">

<p> By miracle he was saved, and, like the Polar needle, true to his first
affection, back he rushed, impatient still to lay his homage at the adored one’s
feet. But, oh! death-blow to his hopes! torture more cruel than all before he’d
suffered, he found her perjured, faithless, voluntarily about to give her hand
unto another.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="olinska">
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p> Ah! had he known her tears, her anguish, the silent calm despair with which,
unable to resist, she yielded to her parent’s harsh commands, enforced under the
penalty of his awful curse - how like a victim to the sacrifice she did approach
the altar, - he would not, could not, dare not, to condemn her.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="mazeppa">
<speaker>Maz.</speaker>
<p> Had she, then, no remedy to save herself from such accursed pollution?</p>

resolute to clutch at -</p>

<stage>[The Polish troops in the garden fire at the Tartars on the terraces -
the latter charge down the steps - a general conflict ensues - a charge of
Tartar cavalry is made along the upper terrace - they are met by the Poles,
issuing from the principal portal - the attendants endeavour to force Olinska
through the tumult into the castle - the cavalry appear in front, and after
skirmishing off on both sides, a charge in line, from L. to R., is executed by
the Tartars - the front then becomes occupied by pairs of combatants - Ahder
Khan is on the point of cutting down the Castellan, when Olinska rushes in and
interposes - she is followed by Mazeppa, to whom the Castellan resigns her,
which is the pledge of peace - Premislas has been meantime overcome by a Tartar
warrior, and the Poles altogether vanquished - AbderKhan, Mazeppa, the
Castellan, and Olinska hasten to mount the steps, to stop the slaughter, and on
the top form a group - the females line the terraces - subdued Poles and
triumphant Tartars fill the scene, which is lighted by the conflagration of the
forest - and on the general picture the curtain falls.</stage>
