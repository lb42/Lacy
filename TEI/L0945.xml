        <head>ACT I.</head>

        <stage type="setting">SCENE.—An Apartment in the house of Mrs. Colonel Carver at
          Stow-on-the-Wold, fire-place in C., doors, R. and L. of it; another door R. 2. E.; a sofa,
          L.; at L. a window; table, C., with writing materials; chairs, &amp;c., &amp;c.</stage>

        <stage>DAVID in livery and wearing a large wedding favour, is seated at little table,
          writing.</stage>

        <sp>
          <speaker>David.</speaker>
          <p> Let me see what I ha’ written! <stage>(reading letter)</stage> “Dear Cousin Jane, I
            write this from the little town of Stow-on-the-Wold, in Gloucestershire—last week the
            population amounted to 2719, but as soon as master and me arrived, it suddenly shot up
            to 2721—the church bells have been ringing all the morning in honour of my master’s
            marriage with Miss Caroline Anastasia Sophia Elizabeth Carver, which is now being
              solemnized”—<stage>(noise of shouting and hurrahing heard)</stage> hey-day!
              <stage>(jumps up and looks out of window)</stage> it be all over, and here comes the
            bride and bridegroom! <stage>(shouts repeated—David, in his enthusiasm waving his arm
              out of the window and hurrahing with all his might, then coming down)</stage> Poor
            master! he’s gone and done it now, and no mistake! <stage>(listening)</stage> Here comes
            the wedding party—I must finish my letter to Cousin Jane by-and-bye! <stage>(putting
              letter in his pocket)</stage></p>
        </sp>

        <stage>MRS. WOODCOCK, MRS. COLONEL CARVER in bridal attire, and two BRIDESMAIDS enter at
          door R. C.</stage>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
          <p> Don’t agitate yourself, my darling child, it is rather a nervous affair, I know, but
            it’s all over now—nothing could be better, you got through it charmingly.</p>
        </sp>

        <pb n="4"/>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Bridesmaids. </speaker>
          <p>Oh, yes, charmingly!</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
          <p> A little repose, a mouthful of sponge cake and glass of sherry will soon compose you.
            Ladies, support your precious charge—come.</p>
        </sp>

        <stage>Exeunt, door R. 2 E.</stage>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(without)</stage> This way, my dear friends.</p>

          <stage>Enter WOODCOCK, door R. C., in his bridegroom’s costume, followed by two or three
            MALE FRIENDS, with whom he is shaking hands in succession.</stage>

          <p>I’m obliged to you—very much obliged to you, indeed, for seeing me through the awful—I
            mean the interesting ceremony! You’ll excuse my following you to the dining room; you’ll
            find my respectable bride and her blushing mother there—no—I mean—really, what with the
            excitement, the agitation, the—the——</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Friends.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(laughing)</stage> Ha, ha! of course!—all right, old fellow—ha, ha, ha!</p>
        </sp>

        <stage>Exeunt, R. 2 E.</stage>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(coming slowly down—after a short pause)</stage> It’s all over! there’s not the
            slightest doubt about its being all over! the knot is tied, and I am fairly launched on
            the sea of matrimony! I felt uncommonly nervous at first, and then, to make matters
            worse, I thought I never should have got my white kid gloves off; and yet they were
            quite loose when I put them on. I can’t imagine what made them shrink so, unless it was
            the state of nervous excitement they were in—I mean, I was in! ’Pon my life, after all,
            a wedding in a country town is a very jolly affair! In London, a couple walk into church
            and out again, and it makes no more sensation than if they went into a pastrycook’s and
            bought a bun a piece! but in the country it creates a general excitement—the bride and
            bridegroom become objects of universal sympathy—I mean, curiosity—everybody wishes them
            joy, at least they say they do! In short, as I said before, it’s a very jolly affair! I
            shouldn’t mind being married two or three times a week for a considerable time to come.
              <stage>(seeing David)</stage> Ah, David!</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>David.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(sighing, and very seriously)</stage> So, you be really married, sir?</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(assuming a very hilarious manner)</stage> Yes, David! quite married! You may
            look at me with the perfect<pb n="5"/> conviction that you are contemplating the
            portrait of a gentleman thoroughly, totally, and completely married. <stage>(David turns
              away to hide his laughter)</stage> You needn’t turn your head away, David. I don’t
            mind your laughing. I’m laughing myself, ha, ha, ha. <stage>(forcing a very loud
              laugh—then after a short pause)</stage> It does seem funny though, doesn’t it,
            David?</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>David.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(l. c.)</stage> Yes, sir! it <emph>is</emph> a rum go and no mistake!</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> I said nothing about a “rum go,” David,—I limited myself to the expression
            “funny!”</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>David.</speaker>
          <p> Only to think of <emph>your</emph> settling down into a respectable member of society!
            Dear, dear, when I think of your desperate, wild, <emph>au</emph>dacious capers——</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> Hush, David! not so loud? my respected mother-in-law might hear you; and between you
            and me Mrs. Colonel Carver is rather a formidable sort of person!</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>David.</speaker>
          <p> Ees, sir! she <emph>has</emph> a stiffish, frumpish look with her!</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> I said nothing about “stiffish and frumpish,” David,—I limited myself to the
            expression “formidable.” As you say, David, I have been a sad scapegrace—a desperate
            rascal—but when a man has been cutting capers and nothing but capers for twenty years,
            it’s high time he cut them altogether—in plain English, I felt I had had my
              <emph>whack,</emph> and that’s why I’ve just married Miss Caroline Anastasia Sophia
            Elizabeth Carver!</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>David.</speaker>
          <p> Well, sir, they do say a reformed rake makes the best husband, and you certainly had a
            regular good “innings” at it.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> I said nothing about “innings,” David,—I limited myself to the expression
              <emph>“whack!</emph>” Has anything been sent from the railway station?</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>David.</speaker>
          <p> Yes—sir, three parcels—here they be, sir! <stage>(three brown paper parcels are on the
              table)</stage></p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(taking one parcel and opening letter, which is fastened to it)</stage> “Two
            morning gowns in merino—best quality, quilted and lined,—cords and tassels as to order,”
            that’s all right; now the other parcels, David—<stage>(opening the papers attached to
              them)</stage> “Three woollen smoking caps, three cloth ditto, three silk ditto, three
            velvet ditto”—all right. <stage>(opening third paper)</stage> “Twelve pairs of
              slippers<pb n="6"/> to measure, three lined with fur, three with flannel, &amp;c.,
            &amp;c.” Quite correct.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>David.</speaker>
          <p> Morning gowns, caps, and slippers! Why, I never seed you with one or the other in all
            my life, never!</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> Exactly; because, hitherto, my existence has been passed in coats that cramped my
            body, hats that pinched my head, and boots that crippled my feet! But that’s all over,
            David; to-morrow I insert my body into a morning gown, my head into a cap, my feet into
            a pair of slippers, and in that easy and unencumbered state I sink into a comfortable
            arm chair for the remainder of my existence. Not a bad notion, eh, David?</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>David.</speaker>
          <p> I call it a first-rate dodge, sir!</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> I said nothing about a “dodge,” David; I limited myself to the expression “notion.”
            That being the case, David, I hereby convey, transfer, and make over to you from the
            time being my entire stock of dress coats, ditto trousers, ditto waistcoats, white
            neckcloths, black hats, and patent leather boots.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>David.</speaker>
          <p> Oh, thank’ee, sir, thankee!</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. Larkings. </speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(without)</stage> Don’t trouble yourself! I dare say you’ve plenty to do on such
            a day as this.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> Heyday! see who it is, David.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>David.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(looking off at r. c.)</stage> It be a lady, sir. Lor! how I should laugh if it
            was one o’ your old London sweethearts come down to forbid the banns—ha, ha, ha!</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> Hold your tongue, sir, and shew the lady in!</p>
        </sp>

        <stage>As DAVID goes up, enter MRS. LARKINGS, at door R. C., in travelling costume.</stage>

        <sp>
          <speaker>David.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(running back to Woodcock, and aside to him)</stage> All right, sir—I never seed
            her afore!</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> Leave the room! <stage>(David runs out—Woodcock advances to Mrs. Larkings)</stage>
            Madam, may I—eh? yes—Mrs. Larkings!</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. L. </speaker>
          <p><emph>Yes</emph>! in <emph>propria persona.</emph> Well, am I too late? I see I am.
            You’re married? I see you are. <stage>(looking at Woodcock and then bursting into a
              laugh)</stage> Ha, ha, ha! I can’t help laughing!</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> So it seems. Yes, fair lady, I entered the holy<pb n="7"/> state of wedlock exactly
            seventeen minutes and a half ago. <stage>(looking at watch)</stage></p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. L. </speaker>
          <p>I should so like to have seen you! what fun it must have been—ha, ha, ha!</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(aside)</stage> What does she mean by “fun?” and what <emph>can</emph> she be
            laughing at? <stage>(aloud and assuming a very solemn manner)</stage> Mrs. Larkings, if
            you allude to the solemnization of the nuptial rites, <emph>I</emph> saw no fun in
            it.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. L. </speaker>
          <p>No, of course <emph>you</emph> didn’t! ha, ha, ha! but tell me how is—how is
              <emph>Mrs.</emph> Woodcock? Ha, ha, ha!</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(aside)</stage> Mrs. Larkings is gradually becoming unpleasant.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. L. </speaker>
          <p>Of course I couldn’t allow the dear girl to be married without wishing her joy, poor
            thing.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(aside)</stage> What does she mean by “poor thing?”</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. L. </speaker>
          <p>So I took the express train, and here I am! I suppose she was dreadfully agitated, poor
            thing?</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(aside)</stage> That’s <emph>two</emph> poor things! <stage>(aloud)</stage>
            Agitated! not she; she was all animation—all joy—all——</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
          <p> Yes, yes! she naturally would be <emph>at first,</emph> poor thing.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(aside)</stage> Another “poor thing,” and Mrs. Larkings and I shall have a
            row.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
          <p> Well, as I have unluckily arrived too late to witness the ceremony—I’d have given

          <p> All I can do is to give the bride and bridegroom my blessing, and go back by the next

          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> And to Larkings! By-the-bye, how is your Christopher? I hope your Christopher is still

            no wonder—we married for love; our tastes, our opinions are the same, and what is still
            more important, we are nearly the same age—Christopher is twenty-four; I am twenty-two!
            now between you and Caroline the gap is much wider.</p>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
          <p> You determined to marry and settle down quietly, and all that sort of thing—exactly!

          <p> You intend that she <emph>shall!</emph> of course! indeed, Mrs. Colonel Carver writes

        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
          <p> With a young and blooming bride for a companion, how delightful it will be! The Alps!

        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> Yes, very delightful; but very fatiguing; besides, I’ve seen it all. I know
            Switzerland and Italy, just as well as I do St. Martin’s Church. I admit I’ve only seen
            the Colosseum at Rome, twice; but as on my <emph>second</emph> visit I found it in
            exactly the same state as on my<pb n="9"/>
            <emph>first</emph> visit, I’ve no wish to pay it a <emph>third</emph> visit, merely to
            establish the fact that on my third visit, I found it in exactly the same state as on my
            second visit.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>

        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> What of that? I can describe it to her, can’t I? besides, I married to stop at home,
            not to go abroad! in a word, Mrs. Woodcock, like a sensible woman, entirely approves of
            the programme I have drawn up for our connubial existence. <stage>(taking paper out of
              his pocket)</stage> Here it is—I haven’t consulted her about it, but she entirely
            approves of it, nevertheless. In the morning she’ll attend to her household duties,
            while I go out fishing—I’m very fond of fishing! After dinner she’ll do a little
            gardening, water the plants, pull up the weeds, kill the caterpillars, while I smoke my
            cigar, and—look on. In the evening she’ll take her work, darn the stockings, sew on
            buttons, and so on, while I take a nap in my arm chair. Then we wind up with a lively
            game at dominoes, or “double dummy,” have a light supper—pork chops, or a basin of
            gruel, and—retire! <stage>(throwing paper on the table)</stage></p>

          <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(smiling)</stage> Very charming, indeed! but pray be cautious! if you plunge poor
            dear Caroline too suddenly into such a vortex of gaiety and dissipation, I’m afraid it
            will be too much for her! <stage>(satirically)</stage></p>

          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p>

        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
          <p> One word more! now, Mr. Woodcock! look at me, Mr. Woodcock! When Mrs. Colonel Carver
            consented to your marriage with her daughter, was she acquainted with your previous
            career, Mr. Woodcock? your long catalogue of follies and extravagancies, Mr.
            Woodcock?</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(alarmed and anxiously)</stage> Hush!</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
          <p> Your notorious reputation for gallantry, Mr. Woodcock?</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> Hush—hush! don’t speak so loud! <stage>(looking round, then in a low tone to Mrs.
              Larkings)</stage> I’ll tell you how it happened! You see, we were two Woodcocks—in
            fact, a brace of Woodcocks, Benjamin and Marmaduke. I’m Marmaduke, from which you may
            infer with a tolerable degree of accuracy that my brother was Benjamin!<pb n="10"/>
            Well, Benjamin was always one of the quiet going sort, in short, a serious young man; in
            fact, he was known as the “tame Woodcock,” because he was what is called decidedly
            “slow;” now I was called the “Wild Woodcock,” because——</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
          <p> You were decidedly “fast!”</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> Yes! Well, when Mrs. Colonel Carver made the usual enquiries as to respectability,
            moral character, and all that sort of thing—she somehow or other stumbled on the wrong
            Woodcock—the tame one instead of the wild one—and——</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
          <p> And you took advantage of her mistake? Fie, fie, Mr. Woodcock! I couldn’t have
            believed it of you.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> The very words I said. “Woodcock,” said I, “I couldn’t have believed it of you.” But
            you won’t betray me, my dear and highly valued friend? you won’t go and dash the cup of
            connubial bliss from my lips? because I have seen Mrs. Colonel Carver turn very red in
            the face at the merest trifle, and—here she comes. <stage>(with an imploring look at
              Mrs. Larkings)</stage></p>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
          <p> Yes, yes! now, listen to me! in a word, I am not the woman you take me for!</p>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
          <p> Pshaw! I don’t mean that! in short, Marmy, you have repeatedly said to yourself—don’t

        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> No, no! I solemnly protest that—<stage>(aside)</stage>—I have said so no end of

          <p> You are mistaken, Marmy! that austerity of deportment—that rigidity of manner was all
            assumed. Listen! You see this brooch? <stage>(pointing to one in her dress)</stage> It
            contains the portrait of the late Lieutenant-Colonel Carver, done in oil.</p>

          <p> I mean to say, I’ve heard say that’s what they all say—that’s all I say!</p>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
          <p> I believed him, and we were married! That very day, Marmy, he retired on half-pay!</p>

          <p> Thirty-nine!</p>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> You mean, he said he was thirty-nine. Ha, ha! I’ve known lots of fellows who say
            they’re thirty-nine when in fact they—never mind!</p>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
          <p> I was under twenty, had been strictly and<pb n="13"/> severely brought up—is it then
            to be wondered at that I yearned, I may say, panted for those gaieties, those amusements
            so natural to my age? But, alas! it was not to be, for while I was revelling in the
            anticipation of entering into what is called “Life,” he told me, and I repeat his own
            unfeeling selfish words, that he had had his <emph>whack.</emph>
            <stage>(Woodcock looks astonished)</stage> Whack! such a vulgar expression!</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> Low! very low, indeed! a colonel, especially a colonel on horseback, ought to have
            been above it!</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
          <p> But that wasn’t all; he actually had the barbarity, on our very wedding day, to draw
            up what he called a programme of our matrimonial existence, <stage>(Woodcock still more
              astonished, suddenly remembers his own programme, which is lying on the table)</stage>
            in which <emph>I</emph> was condemned to the dull monotony of household duties.</p>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(aside)</stage> How very odd. I wonder if there was anything in it about killing
            buttons, and sewing on caterpillars.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
          <p> While <emph>he,</emph> forsooth, was to enjoy himself; go out fishing, smoke his
            cigar, and take his nap in his arm chair. <stage>(angrily)</stage></p>

          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(aside)</stage> This is a very singular coincidence; because, I’ll take my oath,
              <emph>I</emph> never saw Carver’s programme! <stage>(he has gradually approached the
              table, and, watching his opportunity, suddenly snatches the paper off it and crams it

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
          <p> But <emph>that</emph> wasn’t all; he actually expressed his intention of laying aside
            his splendid regimentals—those regimentals that I loved so much, and wearing nothing but
            those odious abominations called morning gowns for the remainder of his existence.

            and his feet into a pair of embroidered slippers. <stage>(during the above, she has kept
              on banging the paper parcels)</stage> Yes; embroidered, no doubt, by some unhappy

          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
          <p> Such, Marmy, was my married life for twenty years. Anxious, therefore, that Caroline
            should escape my wretched fate, I resolved to find her a husband who, like herself, had
            never enjoyed what is called “Life.”</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> And you pitched upon me!</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
          <p> I did; every enquiry I made about you convinced me you were the very man I was looking
            for. “He is no second Carver,” said I, “he is not satiated with the pleasures, the
            gaieties, the amusements of the world,” said I, “he has never even tasted them,” said I,
            “and therefore,” said I, “he’ll be the more ready to plunge headlong into the dazzling
            and intoxicating scene before him,” said I.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> Did you?</p>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
          <p> Yes! “Caroline will plunge in with him,” said I, “and I—I shall plunge in after both
            of them,” said I.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> You?</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
          <p> Of course! <stage>(with increasing animation)</stage> Haven’t I to make up the twenty
            years I lost with Carver? yes, and what’s more, I mean to make them up! Yes, Marmy!
            balls, concerts, operas, assemblies, masquerades, regattas, races!—wherever you are,
            there will I be! Wherever you go, there will I go. Oh, how I long to begin! how I pant
            to mingle in “the gay, the gay, the festive scenes—the halls, the halls of dazzling
            light,” and sport the light fantastic toe in the merry, joyous dance! <stage>(dancing a

            substance! she couldn’t do it! <stage>(aloud)</stage> I’m only afraid, my very dear Mrs.
            Carver, that “light fantastic toe” of yours won’t have much to do in our quiet little
            town of Stow-on-the-Wold!</p>

          <p> I know what you are going to say, Marmy, but don’t be alarmed! we’ve settled
            everything without you—in short, you’ll have nothing whatever to do except to supply the

          <p> In the first place that kindest, best of creatures, Mrs. Larkings has already secured

            <stage>(to Mrs. Larkings)</stage> And can you, will you indeed fulfil all your
            delightful promises?</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
          <p> Yes! not only those I have made to you, but to Mr. Woodcock, <stage>(with intention,
              and then aside to Woodcock)</stage> namely, not to strip the “Wild Woodcock” of his
            borrowed plumes—not to betray him to a certain<pb n="18"/> lady who turns “very red in
            the face at the merest trifle,” provided he promises to think less of himself, and more
            of his wife; in other words, that he consents to exchange programmes. <stage>(after some
              hesitation, Woodcock draws his programme out of his pocket, looks imploringly at Mrs.
              Larkings, who shakes her head—he then gives her his programme, and snatching hers out
              of her hand, thrusts it angrily into his pocket)</stage></p>

          <p> I thought I had—but I haven’t! I want them again, David, for my “second innings.”
            David, <stage>(making a wry face)</stage> you can have the morning gowns, caps and
            slippers instead. <stage>(stopping David who is about to exclaim)</stage> Hush! the
            morning gowns and caps you’ll find in that drawer, <stage>(pointing to table)</stage>
              and—<stage>(looking towards the Ladies)</stage>—here are the slippers! <stage>(pulling

          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>

          <p> Here it is, sir, No. 81. <stage>(giving ticket)</stage></p>

          <p> 81? it’s 18!</p>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Maid.</speaker>
          <p> No, sir, you’ve got it upside down! <stage>(Maid goes out with things, r.)</stage></p>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> I see! One’s obliged to be particular, because at the very last dinner party I was at,
            I got a ticket No. 9 in exchange for a bran-new brown silk umbrella; and when I asked
            for my bran-new brown silk umbrella in exchange for ticket No. 9, they told me that
            ticket No. 9 was ticket No. 6, and handed me one American overshoe and a walking
            stick.</p>

          <speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>

          <p> They’re all right, my dear; that’s more than I can say for my dress! only see how

          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
          <p> Now, my dear, I think we may venture into the ball room!</p>

          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
          <p> Marmy has got them.</p>

        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
          <p> Nonsense, you put them in your pocket, you must have them somewhere about you!</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> If I have, they must have slipped down into my boots! Would you like me to take off my

        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
          <p> I dare say you’ve dropped them.</p>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> No, I’m positive I didn’t drop them. <stage>(aside)</stage> I flung ’em away!</p>

          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
          <p> How careless of you! what’s to be done?</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> Well, it strikes me there’s only one thing to be done—go home again. <stage>(hurrying
              to door, r., and calling out)</stage> Ticket No. 18! No. 81! two opera cloaks, one
            hat, one comforter, one Inverness cape.</p>

          <p>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
          <p> You can’t deny it, Mr. Woodcock. You must know—<stage>(to Mrs. Larkings)</stage>—that
            I had bought this coronet expressly for your ball to-night, but when I wanted it to put
            it on, it had disappeared! <stage>(Mrs. Larkings looks aside at Woodcock—puts on a look

        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
          <p> Yes! We hunted for it everywhere. At last where do think it was found? In Marmy’s

          <p> That attempt of mine upon Mrs. Woodcock’s coronet was a contemptible failure.
              <stage>(yawning)</stage> I wonder if I shall ever have a good night’s rest again!
            Never mind, I’ll make up for it when I get back to Stow-on-the-Wold—if ever I do get
            back; I won’t get up for a month! I believe Mrs. Woodcock would go back if it wasn’t for
            Carver. I wish somebody would marry Carver! I’ll give any man a thousand pounds if he’ll
            marry—and after all, Carver’s not absolutely repulsive—and I’m sure there’s plenty of
            her for the money.</p>

        <sp>

        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Swans.</speaker>
          <p> The fact is, Woodcock, <stage>(yawning, Woodcock does the same)</stage> before I got
            married, I had seen a good deal of this sort of fun. <stage>(yawning very

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> Why, to stop at home?</p>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Swans.</speaker>
          <p> I don’t go out!</p>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>

        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Swans.</speaker>

          <p> I hit on a very simple plan! I had a regular stock of sudden indispositions to meet
            every invitation that came in; headaches, rheumatisms, lumbagoes, &amp;c., &amp;c., Mrs.
            Swansdown grumbled a good deal at first, but she soon got used to it, and——</p>

          <p> Delightful party, eh? By-the-bye—I congratulate you—your wife is really a very nice
            sort of person—very nice, indeed! <stage>(in a patronizing tone)</stage> but her dancing
            has been sadly neglected. However, make yourself easy, I’ve engaged her for the next

          <p> Come, come, Woodcock—that grave face won’t do with me, besides, it isn’t because I
            flirt with my friend’s wives that I love them! I flirt with yours, but I don’t love her,
            at least, not yet! ha, ha! but I say, old fellow, don’t follow Swansdown’s example—what
            can a man on the wrong side of forty expect if he will go home to bed and leave a pretty
            young wife behind him, eh? ha, ha! <stage>(poking Woodcock in the side)</stage></p>

          <p> No, but that’s not all—not that I meant any harm—well, after a luncheon of grilled
            chicken and champagne, this afternoon—I don’t know how the deuce it happened, but I’ve a
            sort of stupid, misty recollection of writing a stupid sort of letter, full of doves and
            loves, and Cupid’s darts and bleeding hearts—you know what I mean—which letter, I’m
            under a very strong impression, Mrs. Swansdown will find on her dressing table when she

          <p> Yes, yes, it was a stupid thing to do, I know, and I heartily wish I had the
            confounded letter back, but it’s too late now, and after all, I meant no harm.

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
          <p> I know better! they’ll have to amputate it! I shall have a one-armed son-in-law—a
            wretched, helpless cripple! <stage>(suddenly to Mrs. Larkings)</stage> My dear friend,
            go to poor dear Caroline—don’t leave her till I’ve had time to do all my screaming! I
            know I screamed in the cab, but not half enough! Go, go!</p>

          <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
          <p> Yes, I am! I feel I’m rapidly settling down into an atrocious profligate, and I can’t

            Caroline;” but you would bring me to London—you know you would, and what’s the result?
            that one dear Caroline isn’t enough for me! I must have a dozen—two dozen—three dozen
            “dear Carolines!” an unlimited quantity of “dear Carolines!!” <stage>(very

      <p>This transcription is based on a copy of the Samuel French edition, scans of which have
        been posted on the Internet Archive at:</p>

          archive.org/details/MortonWoodcocksLittleGame</ref></p>

      <p>Because of the print quality of the Samuel French edition, an American reprint published by
        Harold Roorbach in 1889 was used as an additional resource. Scans of the copy held by the
        Library of Congress are posted at:</p>

      <p><ref target="https://archive.org/details/woodcockslittleg00mort">
          archive.org/details/woodcockslittleg00mort</ref></p>

      <p>In general, this transcription attempts to retain the formatting, punctuation and spelling
        of the source text. Variant spellings such as “bran-new” and “trowsers” have been retained
        as have some inconsistencies in spelling, such as “ball room” vs. “ball-room” and “thank’ee”
        vs. “thankee”. Some changes were made to correct for printing errors and for minor
        inconsistencies in formatting, punctuation and spelling.</p>

      <p>The following changes were made to the text:</p>

      <list>
        <item>p. 2: The upper right side of this page in the Samuel French edition was blank. Thus,
          the name of the theater and the last names of the actors were corrected or added based on
          the Roorbach edition.</item>

        <item>p. 4: there’s not the slightest doubt about it’s being all over!—Change “it’s” to
          “its”.</item>

        <item>pp. 6-7: Yes, fair lady. I entered the holy state of wedlock—Changed what appears to
          be a period to a comma in keeping with the Roorbach edition.</item>

        <item>p. 8: The gap! <emph>she</emph> is under twenty, while you   —how old shall we

          “his”.</item>

        <item>pp. 13-14: <stage><stage><stage>(banging her hand on one of the parcels to Woodcock’s
                great alarm)</stage></stage></stage>—Changed “<emph>Woodcock’s</emph>” to
          “Woodcock’s” for consistency.</item>

        <item>p. 14: Yes; embroidered, no doubt, by some unhappy creature he had professed to me as
          he did me.—Changed “me” after “professed to” to “love” based on the Roorbach
          edition.</item>

        <item>p. 17: <emph>Enter</emph> Mrs Larkings <emph>in travelling dress, door</emph> r. 2
          e.—Inserted a period after “Mrs”.</item>

        <item>p. 19: (taking off Mrs. Woodcock’s cloak)—Changed “<emph>Mrs. Woodcock’s</emph>” to
          “Mrs. Woodcock’s” for consistency.</item>

        <item>p. 19: (taking hold of Mrs. Carver’s cloak behind and giving it a violent tug)—Changed
            “<emph>Mrs. Carver’s</emph>” to “Mrs. Carver’s” for consistency.</item>

        <item>p. 20: <emph>Enter</emph> Mrs. Larkings, <emph>at</emph> c., <emph>in fashionable
            evening dress.</emph>—Ladies <emph>and</emph> Gentlemen are seen promenading
          within—Music)—Changed the closing parenthesis to a period.</item>

        <item>p. 22: (to Mrs. Larkings) we’ve settled our costume, my dear!—Capitalized
          “we’ve”.</item>

        <item>p. 28: Wood. (still dancing after them, and aside to Mrs. Swansdown) Don’t tell him
          that, mum—As Mrs. Larkings has the previous line, changed “Mrs. Swansdown” to “Mrs.
          Larkings”.</item>

        <item>p. 28: Mr. L. Luckily, I’m not jealous!—Changed the character title “Mr. L.” to “Mrs.
          L.” in keeping with the Roorbach edition.</item>

        <item>p. 29: Mrs C. (r. c.) My dear friend, never indulge in a plurality of
          epithets—Inserted a period after “Mrs”.</item>

        <item>p. 31: But how <emph>is</emph> Mrs Larkings to know anything about it?—Inserted a
          period after “Mrs”.</item>

        <item>p. 33: Confound it! how she’s hurting me?—Changed the question mark to an exclamation
          mark in keeping with the Roorbach edition.</item>

        <item>p. 34: David. So he opens it, ma’am, and (to Larkings who is making violent signs to
          him to hold his tongue) What’s the matter, sir?—Inserted an em dash after “and”.</item>

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
<stage><stage><stage><stage>($1 to $5,000)</stage></stage></stage></stage> are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
