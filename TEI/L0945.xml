    <head>Act I.</head>

    <stage type="setting">Scene.—An Apartment in the house of Mrs. Colonel Carver at
     Stow-on-the-Wold, fire-place in C., doors, R. and L. of it; another door R. 2. E.; a sofa, L.;
     at L. a window; table, C., with writing materials; chairs, &amp;c., &amp;c.</stage>

    <stage>David in livery and wearing a large wedding favour, is seated at little table,
     writing.</stage>

    <sp who="#L0945_M4">
     <speaker>David.</speaker>
     <p> Let me see what I ha’ written! <stage>(reading letter)</stage> “Dear Cousin Jane, I write
      this from the little town of Stow-on-the-Wold, in Gloucestershire—last week the population
      amounted to 2719, but as soon as master and me arrived, it suddenly shot up to 2721—the church
      bells have been ringing all the morning in honour of my master’s marriage with Miss Caroline
      Anastasia Sophia Elizabeth Carver, which is now being solemnized”—<stage>(noise of shouting
      and hurrahing heard)</stage> hey-day! <stage>(jumps up and looks out of window)</stage> it be
      all over, and here comes the bride and bridegroom! <stage>(shouts repeated—David, in his
      enthusiasm waving his arm out of the window and hurrahing with all his might, then coming
      down)</stage> Poor master! he’s gone and done it now, and no mistake!
      <stage>(listening)</stage> Here comes the wedding party—I must finish my letter to Cousin Jane
      by-and-bye! <stage>(putting letter in his pocket)</stage></p>
    </sp>

    <stage>Mrs. Woodcock, Mrs. Colonel Carver in bridal attire, and two Bridesmaids enter at door R.
     C.</stage>

    <sp who="#L0945_F5">
     <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
     <p> Don’t agitate yourself, my darling child, it is rather a nervous affair, I know, but it’s
      all over now—nothing could be better, you got through it charmingly.</p>
    </sp>

    <pb n="4"/>

    <sp who="#L0945_Mul">
     <speaker>Bridesmaids.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, yes, charmingly!</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_F5">
     <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
     <p> A little repose, a mouthful of sponge cake and glass of sherry will soon compose you.
      Ladies, support your precious charge—come.</p>
    </sp>

    <stage>Exeunt, door R. 2 E.</stage>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">
     <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(without)</stage> This way, my dear friends.</p>

     <stage>Enter Woodcock, door R. C., in his bridegroom’s costume, followed by two or three Male
      Friends, with whom he is shaking hands in succession.</stage>

     <p>I’m obliged to you—very much obliged to you, indeed, for seeing me through the awful—I mean
      the interesting ceremony! You’ll excuse my following you to the dining room; you’ll find my
      respectable bride and her blushing mother there—no—I mean—really, what with the excitement,
      the agitation, the—the——</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_Mul">
     <speaker>Friends.</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(laughing)</stage> Ha, ha! of course!—all right, old fellow—ha, ha, ha!</p>
    </sp>

    <stage>Exeunt, R. 2 E.</stage>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">
     <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(coming slowly down—after a short pause)</stage> It’s all over! there’s not the
      slightest doubt about its being all over! the knot is tied, and I am fairly launched on the
      sea of matrimony! I felt uncommonly nervous at first, and then, to make matters worse, I
      thought I never should have got my white kid gloves off; and yet they were quite loose when I
      put them on. I can’t imagine what made them shrink so, unless it was the state of nervous
      excitement they were in—I mean, I was in! ’Pon my life, after all, a wedding in a country town
      is a very jolly affair! In London, a couple walk into church and out again, and it makes no
      more sensation than if they went into a pastrycook’s and bought a bun a piece! but in the
      country it creates a general excitement—the bride and bridegroom become objects of universal
      sympathy—I mean, curiosity—everybody wishes them joy, at least they say they do! In short, as
      I said before, it’s a very jolly affair! I shouldn’t mind being married two or three times a
      week for a considerable time to come. <stage>(seeing David)</stage> Ah, David!</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M4">
     <speaker>David.</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(sighing, and very seriously)</stage> So, you be really married, sir?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">
     <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(assuming a very hilarious manner)</stage> Yes, David! quite married! You may look
      at me with the perfect
      <pb n="5"/> conviction that you are contemplating the portrait of a gentleman thoroughly,
      totally, and completely married. <stage>(David turns away to hide his laughter)</stage> You
      needn’t turn your head away, David. I don’t mind your laughing. I’m laughing myself, ha, ha,
      ha. <stage>(forcing a very loud laugh—then after a short pause)</stage> It does seem funny
      though, doesn’t it, David?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M4">
     <speaker>David.</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(l. c.)</stage> Yes, sir! it <emph>is</emph> a rum go and no mistake!</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">
     <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
     <p> I said nothing about a “rum go,” David,—I limited myself to the expression “funny!”</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M4">
     <speaker>David.</speaker>
     <p> Only to think of <emph>your</emph> settling down into a respectable member of society!
      Dear, dear, when I think of your desperate, wild, <emph>au</emph>dacious capers——</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">
     <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
     <p> Hush, David! not so loud? my respected mother-in-law might hear you; and between you and me
      Mrs. Colonel Carver is rather a formidable sort of person!</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M4">
     <speaker>David.</speaker>
     <p> Ees, sir! she <emph>has</emph> a stiffish, frumpish look with her!</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">
     <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
     <p> I said nothing about “stiffish and frumpish,” David,—I limited myself to the expression
      “formidable.” As you say, David, I have been a sad scapegrace—a desperate rascal—but when a
      man has been cutting capers and nothing but capers for twenty years, it’s high time he cut
      them altogether—in plain English, I felt I had had my <emph>whack,</emph> and that’s why I’ve
      just married Miss Caroline Anastasia Sophia Elizabeth Carver!</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M4">
     <speaker>David.</speaker>
     <p> Well, sir, they do say a reformed rake makes the best husband, and you certainly had a
      regular good “innings” at it.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">
     <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
     <p> I said nothing about “innings,” David,—I limited myself to the expression
      <emph>“whack!</emph>” Has anything been sent from the railway station?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M4">
     <speaker>David.</speaker>
     <p> Yes—sir, three parcels—here they be, sir! <stage>(three brown paper parcels are on the
      table)</stage></p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">
     <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(taking one parcel and opening letter, which is fastened to it)</stage> “Two morning
      gowns in merino—best quality, quilted and lined,—cords and tassels as to order,” that’s all
      right; now the other parcels, David—<stage>(opening the papers attached to them)</stage>
      “Three woollen smoking caps, three cloth ditto, three silk ditto, three velvet ditto”—all
      right. <stage>(opening third paper)</stage> “Twelve pairs of slippers
      <pb n="6"/> to measure, three lined with fur, three with flannel, &amp;c., &amp;c.” Quite
      correct.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M4">
     <speaker>David.</speaker>
     <p> Morning gowns, caps, and slippers! Why, I never seed you with one or the other in all my
      life, never!</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">
     <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
     <p> Exactly; because, hitherto, my existence has been passed in coats that cramped my body,
      hats that pinched my head, and boots that crippled my feet! But that’s all over, David;
      to-morrow I insert my body into a morning gown, my head into a cap, my feet into a pair of
      slippers, and in that easy and unencumbered state I sink into a comfortable arm chair for the
      remainder of my existence. Not a bad notion, eh, David?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M4">
     <speaker>David.</speaker>
     <p> I call it a first-rate dodge, sir!</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">
     <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
     <p> I said nothing about a “dodge,” David; I limited myself to the expression “notion.” That
      being the case, David, I hereby convey, transfer, and make over to you from the time being my
      entire stock of dress coats, ditto trousers, ditto waistcoats, white neckcloths, black hats,
      and patent leather boots.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M4">
     <speaker>David.</speaker>
     <p> Oh, thank’ee, sir, thankee!</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. Larkings.</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(without)</stage> Don’t trouble yourself! I dare say you’ve plenty to do on such a
      day as this.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">
     <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
     <p> Heyday! see who it is, David.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M4">
     <speaker>David.</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(looking off at r. c.)</stage> It be a lady, sir. Lor! how I should laugh if it was
      one o’ your old London sweethearts come down to forbid the banns—ha, ha, ha!</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">
     <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
     <p> Hold your tongue, sir, and shew the lady in!</p>
    </sp>

    <stage>As David goes up, enter Mrs. Larkings, at door R. C., in travelling costume.</stage>

    <sp who="#L0945_M4">
     <speaker>David.</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(running back to Woodcock, and aside to him)</stage> All right, sir—I never seed her
      afore!</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">
     <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
     <p> Leave the room! <stage>(David runs out—Woodcock advances to Mrs. Larkings)</stage> Madam,
      may I—eh? yes—Mrs. Larkings!</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
     <p><emph>Yes</emph>! in <emph>propria persona.</emph> Well, am I too late? I see I am. You’re
      married? I see you are. <stage>(looking at Woodcock and then bursting into a laugh)</stage>
      Ha, ha, ha! I can’t help laughing!</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">
     <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
     <p> So it seems. Yes, fair lady, I entered the holy
      <pb n="7"/> state of wedlock exactly seventeen minutes and a half ago. <stage>(looking at
      watch)</stage></p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
     <p>I should so like to have seen you! what fun it must have been—ha, ha, ha!</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">
     <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(aside)</stage> What does she mean by “fun?” and what <emph>can</emph> she be
      laughing at? <stage>(aloud and assuming a very solemn manner)</stage> Mrs. Larkings, if you
      allude to the solemnization of the nuptial rites, <emph>I</emph> saw no fun in it.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
     <p>No, of course <emph>you</emph> didn’t! ha, ha, ha! but tell me how is—how is
      <emph>Mrs.</emph> Woodcock? Ha, ha, ha!</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">
     <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(aside)</stage> Mrs. Larkings is gradually becoming unpleasant.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
     <p>Of course I couldn’t allow the dear girl to be married without wishing her joy, poor
      thing.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">
     <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(aside)</stage> What does she mean by “poor thing?”</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
     <p>So I took the express train, and here I am! I suppose she was dreadfully agitated, poor
      thing?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">
     <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(aside)</stage> That’s <emph>two</emph> poor things! <stage>(aloud)</stage>
      Agitated! not she; she was all animation—all joy—all——</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
     <p> Yes, yes! she naturally would be <emph>at first,</emph> poor thing.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">
     <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(aside)</stage> Another “poor thing,” and Mrs. Larkings and I shall have a row.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
     <p> Well, as I have unluckily arrived too late to witness the ceremony—I’d have given anything
      to have seen you—ha, ha! <stage>(laughing immoderately)</stage> You don’t mind my laughing, do
      you?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">
     <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
     <p> Not at all; it’s rather pleasant than otherwise!</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
     <p> All I can do is to give the bride and bridegroom my blessing, and go back by the next train
      to London!</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0945_M1">

     great alarm)</stage></stage></stage>—Changed “<emph>Woodcock’s</emph>” to “Woodcock’s” for
     consistency.</item>

    <item>p. 14: Yes; embroidered, no doubt, by some unhappy creature he had professed to me as he
     did me.—Changed “me” after “professed to” to “love” based on the Roorbach edition.</item>

     e.—Inserted a period after “Mrs”.</item>

     Woodcock’s” for consistency.</item>

     dress.</emph>—Ladies <emph>and</emph> Gentlemen are seen promenading within—Music)—Changed the
     closing parenthesis to a period.</item>

    <item>p. 22: (to Mrs. Larkings) we’ve settled our costume, my dear!—Capitalized “we’ve”.</item>

    <item>p. 28: Wood. (still dancing after them, and aside to Mrs. Swansdown) Don’t tell him that,
     mum—As Mrs. Larkings has the previous line, changed “Mrs. Swansdown” to “Mrs. Larkings”.</item>

    <item>p. 28: Mr. L. Luckily, I’m not jealous!—Changed the character title “Mr. L.” to “Mrs. L.”
     in keeping with the Roorbach edition.</item>

    <item>p. 29: Mrs C. (r. c.) My dear friend, never indulge in a plurality of epithets—Inserted a
     period after “Mrs”.</item>
