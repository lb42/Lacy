      <p>There! if that isn't incompatibility of temper, I don't know what is! Oh, woman, woman!
       when I say woman, I mean women of every sort and description—English women—Dutch
       women—Cochin-Chinese women, they are all alike. Three years ago I took it into my head that I
       had better get married—and at that fatal period, I have not the slightest doubt that I was
       out of my mind—yes—and I was desirous that my wife should bring me, besides every other
       necessary qualification, a small dowry—and I shouldn't have objected even to a large
       dowry—but, as I have just said, I was out of my mind, you know. But, father-in-law says to
       me—"William, it is not money that tempts you, I know—you love Elizabeth for her amiable
       qualities—you are a good young man, William!" And then I stared at him and looked stupid; I
       placed my hand upon my heart, and then I said to him—</p>

       that amount, I can't do it." Then, father-in-law replied—"Noble and disinterested young man,
       come to my arms, and let me bathe you with my tears!" And he did bathe me—and the bath was
       not at all agreeable—but, I married Elizabeth—and I had no dowry with her—and that was the

      <p>Isn't it a beautiful law? The man who invented this law must have been an excellent

     <sp who="#L1093_F2">
      <speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, certainly. Henceforth there will be no more unhappy households—no more disputes

      <p><stage>(rising)</stage> I am perfectly aware of it, but it was your own fault—you should

     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1093_M1">
      <speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, I was. And do you remember how beautifully you sang on the piano the evening before
       our wedding? I never heard anything so enlivening—it sent your father to sleep in less than
       five minutes.</p>

      <p>Not positively; but sometimes you have caused me to regret that you asked for nothing.</p>
