      Stanislaus such of his subjects as may run away from him, and on the other, to keep an eye on
      those of Louis the Fifteenth, as may have the curiosity to pass into Lorraine. The orders are

     <p> Yes. When I left the court of King Stanislaus without taking leave of anyone. That virtuous

    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0691_M3">
     <speaker>D'Aub.</speaker>
     <p> And the reason ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0691_M4">
     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
     <p> Why, you see, necessity compelled me to take a convent by storm.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0691_M3">
     <speaker>D'Aub.</speaker>
     <p> A convent?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0691_M4">
     <speaker>Cap.</speaker>
     <p> Yes, the Convent of the Ursulines, <stage>(D'Aubreuil expresses alarm)</stage> where I had
      accompanied the king to witness the ceremony of a nun taking the veil. In the midst of the
      singers, I remarked a young girl—oh, such a— Talk of Raphael's virgins! such a face—such a
      form—such a smile !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0691_M3">
     <speaker>D'Aub.</speaker>
     <p> And you fell in love with her?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0691_M4">
     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
     <p> That moment and for ever. I knew not who she was, but I remarked in my daily visits to the
      convent, she always wore, either round her neck or in her hair, a rose-coloured ribbon, which
      had a most charming effect. From this I learnt her name, and risked a letter.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0691_M3">
     <speaker>D'Aub.</speaker>
     <p> You wrote to her?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0691_M4">
     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
     <p> A declaration that scorched the very paper. But I never got an answer.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0691_M3">
     <speaker>D'Aub.</speaker>
     <p> You should have written again.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0691_M4">
     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
     <p> So I did, twenty times over; and at last the good king Stanislaus took me aside, and
      informed me the lady abbess had intercepted all the letters I had addressed to Marguerite. A
      pretty name, isn't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0691_M3">
     <speaker>D'Aub.</speaker>
     <p> Well, and the king said—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0691_M4">
     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
     <p> That in consideration of my youth, he was inclined to
      <pb n="9"/> treat the affair as a boyish folly, on condition I pursued it no further.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0691_M3">
     <speaker>D'Aub.</speaker>
     <p> And you promised?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0691_M4">
     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
     <p> No I didn't. I only bowed—which meant either yes or no; and in an hour afterwards I was hid
      in one of the niches of the chapel, and learnt that her cell looked over the garden. I was not
      sure which was her window, but trusted to the dictates of my heart to point it out to me, and
      in the evening I scaled the wall, clambered up to the window—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0691_M3">
     <speaker>D'Aub.</speaker>
     <p> And found yourself—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0691_M4">
     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
     <p> In the apartment of the Lady Abbess.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0691_M3">
     <speaker>D'Aub.</speaker>
     <p> Good heavens!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0691_M4">
     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
     <p> She screamed like a mad woman. Twenty old nuns joined in the chorus, so I made for the
      convent gates, and luckily escaped, and three hours afterwards I was on the frontier, blowing
      kisses to my lady love, which were borne to her by the wind.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0691_M3">
     <speaker>D'Aub.</speaker>
     <p> And at Versailles you soon forgot her!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0691_M4">
     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
     <p> No. I must be more constant in my nature than I had thought, for I'm more in love than
      ever. Besides, there are difficulties. But a few days ago I learnt that on my first attempt to
      re-enter Lorraine, I ran the risk of being accommodated in the Bastile—that first set me
      thinking on the matter, and another circumstance decided me. I received a sudden order to
      rejoin my regiment, near Fontenoy, where Marshal Saxe had appointed to meet us. I left
      Versailles. My comrades were all boasting of the loveliness of their mistresses, who had
      decorated them with a knot of their ribbons on this day of their departure. I alone had none.
      They jeered and laughed at me. Stung to the quick, I vaunted the charms of her I love, and
      swore she should herself attach to my hat the lovely rose-coloured ribbon, which was ever
      fluttering before my eyes. They dared me—me, more deeply in love than ever. So, in defiance of
      their double police, I have engaged my honour for the conquest of Marguerite's colours !</p>

      ball, a rope ladder, prepared by my faithful valet, thrown over the wall you scaled to so
