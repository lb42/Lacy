<stage> The library of Time. A vast apartment filled with bookshelves, on which
are ranged Annual Registers, labelled, 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. Among other volumes are
those labelled b.c. 55; a.d. 1215; a.d. 1630; a.d. 1792; a.d. 1815; A.D. 1830;
A.D. 1848 ; and A.D. 1851, not yet put into its shelf. [ Air —" Turn on, old

scythe in his hand, and an hour-glass before him. </stage>

distant reports of musketry — grisettes attending the wounded. </stage>

<l>Blight clings to leaves that kindred blood has wet. </l>
<l>Not thus, oh Britain, thy broad oak was reared, </l>
<l>With foresight pruned, and nursed by hands revered. </l>
<l>So shall it spread an ever widening shade, </l>
<l>When rots the light growth of the barricade.</l>
<stage> Music. A Folie appears on the summit of the barricade, and shakes her
marotte; the workpeople spring up and welcome her. </stage>

by the workmen and grisettes. A grand galope. After dance a group is formed, and

<l>Then thro' this pipe, a waste pipe called, you let your means flow fast,
sirs,</l>
