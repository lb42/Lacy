        <head>Scene</head>
        <stage> Back parlour at Mr. Plummy's.—The shop (a Chemist and Druggist's) seen through the
          door C. Chairs, tables, &amp;c. Doors R. and L ; packages of medicines, and medicine
          bottles piled about.</stage>
        <stage>MR. and Mrs. Plummy seated at breakfast. </stage>
        <stage>Bell heard.</stage>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> There is the shop bell, my dear.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> I hear it. I never sat down to any meal in my life, breakfast, dinner, tea, or supper,
            that that bell didn't instantly begin to ring.</p>
        </sp>
        <stage>Enter Joe from C., with a pill box in his hand.</stage>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Joe.</speaker>
          <p> Please, sir, here's Mrs. Jones, the laundress, says you sent her the wrong pills
            yesterday.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(flinging down his knife and fork.)</stage> There ! Did you ever hear a more
            ridiculous message than that ? What can it possibly signify to the woman what sort of
            pills she takes! They're all the same price. Begone, sir, and interrupt me again at your
            peril! <stage>(Joe runs out.)</stage> Now my dear, another egg, eh ? Some more ham ?
            Humph!</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> No more, thank you, Henry, I've done. <stage>(folds up her napkin.)</stage></p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> Done breakfast! Why you've hardly begun!</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P. </speaker>
          <p>I can't waste two hours over so insignificant a meal as you do.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> What do you mean by wasting two hours? I'm eating the whole time. The fact is, Mary
            Matilda, you <pb n="4"/> never do eat! You think you do, but you don't; you only
            nibble—I'll be bound you didn't notice that these eggs were boiled as hard as Derbyshire
            petrifactions!</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> I confess I did not.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> I'll trouble you for the butter.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> You took the last bit just now.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> I suppose there's more in the house ?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> No, the man forgot to call yesterday.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> No butter ! I don't mean to butter myself, I mean flatter myself, but really do think
            that my little comforts deserve a little more attention.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> Here's a piece more ham, dear.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> Ham! You know I don't care much about ham. <stage>(sticking his fork into a large
              slice of ham, and beginning to eat it. )</stage></p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(laying her hand on his arm just as he is raising a piece of ham to his
              mouth.)</stage> Now, listen to me, Henry dear; if you indulge so much in the pleasures
            of the table, and take so little exercise, you'll very soon become so stout that you'll
            be quite an object !</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> Stout! Me! Ha! ha! ha! I like that! <stage>(trying again to eat. )</stage></p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(stops him.)</stage> And then, Henry dear, I shan't be able to endure the sight
            of you; for if there is one thing I have a greater horror of than another, its <hi>a
              little fat man !</hi></p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> My dearest Mary Matilda, you're wrong ! I happen to be getting thinner every day !</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> How can you say so ? Haven't I been obliged to let out every one of your waistcoats ?
            But put on your hat, and we'll go out and take a walk.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> A walk! You forget the well-known proverb: " After breakfast walk a mile." I mean "
            Sit a mile," I should say " Sit awhile."</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P. </speaker>
          <p>But I particularly want you to go shopping with me.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> You really must excuse me ! Going shopping is a thing I detest! The girls look at me
            so ! 'Pon my life they do ; but there's cousin George, he'll go with you —he don't mind
            the girls looking at him—he rather likes it.</p>
        </sp>
        <pb n="5"/>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> Henry, remember what I said just now! Without exercise you're sure to be ill! You
              <hi>never</hi> leave the house except to<hi> dine out.</hi></p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> Mary Matilda, there are certain sacred duties we owe to society, and dining out is one
            of 'em.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> Nay, Henry, you must come with me. I have seen such a love of a riding habit, and so
            cheap.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> Of course, of course! But considering that you're not in the habit of riding, I don't
            see how you can possibly want a riding habit.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> Why for our trip to Switzerland, of course; you've promised to take me for the last
            three years.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(aside.)</stage> There's the old story beginning again !—<stage>(aloud.)</stage>
            Now Mary Matilda, let me ask you, as a sensible woman, how can I possibly leave my
            business ? Besides, what's the use of going all the way to Switzer­land when you can see
            Mont Blanc without stirring out of Piccadilly, and have a comfortable chair to sit on
            into the bargain ! That's the sort of travelling <hi>I like.</hi></p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(nettled.)</stage> In short, sir, you <hi>refuse</hi> to take me? Very well, Mr.
            P !</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(taking a lump of sugar out of basin, and putting it into his mouth.)</stage> Now
            how can you be so unjust ? Knowing your partiality for Switzerland, did'nt I take you
            last week to the waxwork, and did'nt I show you William Tell, with the identical bow and
            arrow with which he shot his little boy's head off—-I mean something or other off his
            little boy's head ?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> Yes, yes! Come, Henry, when shall we start ? <stage>(taking his arm,
              coaxingly.)</stage> This day week ?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> This day week! I've business! Important business to attend to.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> What business ?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> Why I've got to collect my pills! I mean bills.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> That's very soon done. You've only got to ask for your money.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> I beg your pardon! I've got to <hi>get</hi> the money after I <hi>have</hi> asked for
            it. Besides, I must consult our friend, Doctor Dulcet, about you.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> About me! I'm perfectly well!</p>
        </sp>
        <pb n="6"/>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> Exactly! Then as the pure air of Pentonville agrees with you, why leave it ? Common
            sense suggests the question, Why leave it ?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> Pshaw!</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>COUSIN George.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(without.)</stage> This way! This way! Gently with the crockery!</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> Crockery! What's the meaning of "Crockery?" <stage>(smash heard.)</stage> Oh, that's
            what it means!</p>
        </sp>
        <stage>Enter COUSIN George at door C., followed by Two MEN, carrying a large hamper, which
          they put down.</stage>
        <sp>
          <speaker>George.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(to Plummy, and holding out his hand.)</stage> A shilling!</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(bewildered, mechanically puts his hand into his pocket, and gives George money,
              who gives it to men.)</stage>
          </p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>MEN.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(to George.)</stage> Thank your honour ! <stage>(The MEN go out at C. and

        </sp>

          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(to George.)</stage> Thank <hi>your</hi> honour! Considering the shilling came

            this mean ?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>George.</speaker>
          <p> Why, it means that as Mrs. Brittle, round the corner, couldn't pay your little account
            for medicines, I took it out in crockery—such a bargain! Thirty-nine dozen soup-plates,
            seventeen tureens, and a salad-bowl— think of that!</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> Well, 'pon my life, Mrs. Brittle is a cool sort of a person. She paid my last account
            with forty-seven dozen pie-plates, and a tea-pot. Never mind, I'll be even with her;
            I'll go this moment and order the handsomest dessert service she's got in her shop, and
            pay her out in pills.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> Dont! Poor woman, she's a large family. <stage>(puts on her bonnet and shawl.)</stage>
            By-the-bye, Cousin George, you havn't breakfasted ?</p>

          <p> Yes, when Mr. Plummy's ready; he's only been two hours over his breakfast, that's
            all!</p>
        </sp>

          <p> For shame, Plummy—by-the-bye, how stout <pb n="7"/>you're getting! <stage>(to Mrs.

          <p> Of course she will, and thank you into the bargain. <stage>(aside.)</stage> And so
            shall I. I wouldn't be with a cousin in the house for all the world; cousins are such

          <p> I've said quite enough ; if you won't take the hint, it's your fault, and not mine.
            So, as I said before, if you value your domestic happiness, take more exercise—walk,
            run, ride, dance, I don't care what, only keep under thirteen stone, and, above all,
            remember the pumpkin !      <stage>  [Exit        door C.</stage></p>

          <p> Well, but—stop—oh, absurd! He's joking! and yet I don't like that allusion to the
            pumpkin at all. How people can say I'm getting stout, I can't imagine. I don't mean to
            say I'm thin—I'm not a skeleton, no ! but I still retain all my natural symmetry of
            form, and elasticity of motion. <stage>(making a jump.)</stage> Wheugh! Mary Matilda
            certainly did say that she couldn't endure a little fat man; but am I fat ? That's the
            question; by-the-bye, I wonder what I do weigh ? That stupid old Doctor with his
            thirteen stone! Absurd ! Ah ! I quite forgot I had a weighing machine, and there it is.
            Here, Joe, bring in the weighing machine! <stage>(Joe pushes in weighing machine at door
              C. then goes out again.)</stage> I'll ascertain my avoirdupoise to four pounds. I

            eleven—now then! <stage>(heaps up weights into one scale.)</stage> There, that's eleven
            stone exactly!—now then! <stage>(sits down in the other scale, and pulls it down with a

            Fourteen pounds more ; of course I shan't turn the scale now ! <stage>(sits down and
              comes down with a run as before.)</stage> Oh, pooh! pooh! these weights must be wrong,
            or else the machine out of order; no, then I am more than twelve stone; but how much ?
            Not more than a pound or two! <stage>(sits down again, and begins putting weights one

              exclamation.)</stage> Thirteen stone all but a pound! Goodness gracious! One pound

          <p> Oh yes—at least I could before I unfortunately got so stout. <stage>(Plummy looks

            if he's married; if he is, and lives happily with Mrs. Slide, it's very clear that I've

            "Twenty-eight," says I. " What's your height ?" " Five feet six and a half." " What's
            your weight ?"</p>

          <speaker>Slide.</speaker>
          <p> Oh dear, no! I was comparatively thin, then! I was only within one pound of thirteen

          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>

        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Slide.</speaker>
          <p> Well. "Take more exercise," says he ; "Keep within thirteen stone," says he, "or
            there'll be no stopping you," says he.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> Goodness gracious! Did he make any absurd allusion to a species of vegetable called a
            pumpkin ?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Slide.</speaker>
          <p> And his words came true. Only look at me ! <stage>(with a deep sigh.)</stage></p>

          <p> No ! She promised to return when I became a thinner man ! But, alas ! the Rubicon was
            passed. I had suffered myself to exceed thirteen stone, and then, as the doctor very
            truly said, there was no stopping me ! Only look at me ! See what I have come to, and in
            six short months ! What shall I be this time twelve months ?</p>

          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(aside with desperation.)</stage> What, indeed! Sixteen ounces more, and I shall
            become a wretched, unwieldy pumpkin, like the unhappy Slide, and then, Mary
            Matilda—there's not a moment to be lost! What's to be done ? Ah ! <stage>(suddenly
              seizing slide violently by the arm.)</stage> You're a professor of Gymnastics, eh ? I
            want to go into active training, immediately—this very moment, you hear ? You must
            reduce me—reduce me very considerably ! What have you got here ? <stage>(Slide taking
              out two pairs of boxing-gloves from the blue bag.)</stage> Boxing­gloves ! the very
            thing ! Put 'em on—put 'em on, directly. <stage>(he and Slide put on gloves.)</stage>
            Now then, don't spare me ! <stage>(sparring, Plummy gets a crack on nose.)</stage> Never
            mind ! <stage>(rubs nose.)</stage> Come on again! <stage>(gets another crack on
              nose—rubs it.)</stage></p>

            present! Phew ! it's hard work! I wonder how much I weigh now ? <stage>(runs and jumps
              into scale C. ; weighs himself.)</stage> Not an ounce difference ! Still thirteen
            stone all but a pound! Suppose I try dancing—I will! <stage>(to Slide.)</stage> You
            teach dancing ? How much a lesson? How much a lesson? <stage>(dancing about in a high
              state of excitement)</stage></p>

            There ! And now let's begin something quick, very quick, sir! the college hornpipe—I

            coat ? <stage>(Slide strikes up the college hornpipe, Plummy dances energetically,

            hour or two! <stage>(suddenly.)</stage> 'Pon my life I don't think I'm quite so stout as
            I was—I am sure I'm not! That tremendous effort I made with the coal scuttle—yes, that
            did the trick! I felt I was rapidly losing flesh the whole time I was lugging it up from
            the cellar. I'll weigh myself again ; if I have only lost an ounce, I shall be
            satisfied, perfectly satisfied! <stage><stage>(not knowing what to do with the bag, puts

            be—yes it is ! I've reached the fatal point—thirteen stone, and now there'll be no
            stopping me! <stage>(jumping up.)</stage> Nature, for some mysterious purpose or other,
            has made me an exception to the general rule: the more exercise I take the stouter I
            get! Ah! <stage>(seeing DOCTOR, who enters at door R. H., rushes, grasps his hand, and
              drags him forward.)</stage> Doctor, you told me to take more exercise ; the more I
            take, the stouter I get! I've done more in the last half hour than Hercules ever did in
            his life, and the result is I'm a pound heavier than I was before: I've reached the
            thirteen stone! Stop me! Give me something—I don't care what. I'll swallow a whole sea
            of vinegar! Only stop me, if you love me; don't let me go any farther !</p>

            ? <stage>(sits down, and slowly sinks.)</stage> Lost! I'm heavier than ever! I'm like a
            snow-ball, the more I roll, the bigger I get! Two pounds in half an hour ! why, at this

          <p> I can, mum. Master wants to get thin—I'm sure of it, 'cause I had my ear to the

          <p> On my knees, am I ? Yes, I was picking up these lucifer boxes, that's all.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> He was thanking me for his appointment. Here it is. <stage>(gives paper to
              Plummy.)</stage></p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(passing paper to George.)</stage> There it is. Oh, Mary Matilda—<stage>(about to
              embrace her.)</stage></p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> It's more than you deserve after requesting Doctor Dulcet to forbid my going to
            Switzerland! Fie ! Fie ! If you had honestly and frankly told me you preferred being
            stout, and that you feared the air of Switzer­land would make you thinner—</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(suddenly.)</stage> Do you think it would?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> Certainly!</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> Then we'll start directly, this very moment! Come along! <stage>(turning up with Mrs.
              Plummy.)</stage></p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> The riding habit!</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> We'll go and buy it. Come along. <stage>(turning up again.)</stage></p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> But where's the money to come from ? With one thing and another I shall want at least
            twelve pounds.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(suddenly.)</stage> Twelve! Ah ! Of course! Here! <stage>(taking bag out of one
              of his pockets.)</stage> And here! <stage>(taking purse out of the other and giving it
              to Mrs. Plummy, who shows how heavy they are.)</stage></p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> Oh, thanks, Henry dear! Come, confess ! Don't you feel your heart all the lighter from
            having indulged your wife's request ?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(sighing.)</stage> Ah, my heart's light enough! It isn't my heart that weighs me
            down, <stage>(falling in scales, and finding he does'nt sink.)</stage> Holloa! Can it
            be— Yes— Ha! ha! I'm a pound lighter! <stage>(taking up a pound.)</stage> Two pounds!
            Ha! ha ! Two pounds in ten minutes, my love! Think of that, my angel! Ha! ha !</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p>
            <stage>(smiling, aside, and showing purses.)</stage> No wonder!</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> And now—</p>
          <stage>Enter Joe, carrying a loaf of bread on a small tray.</stage>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Joe.</speaker>
          <p> Please, sir, what sort of a pickle would you like with your bread ?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> Ha! ha! <stage>(aside.)</stage> A brilliant idea! I'll destroy master George's beauty.
              <stage>(aloud.)</stage> Cousin George, I bear no malice, and to prove it, you'll make
            this house your home in our absence. You shall live here, and board here.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>George.</speaker>
          <p> Plummy, you're a trump!</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> I am. Joe, come here. <stage>(aside.)</stage> You see that young man!—nothing but skin
            and bone, poor fellow; I charge you with the agreeable duty of fattening him up —make a
            pumpkin of him ! in short, for every pound he gains in weight, I'll give you a guinea
            !</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Joe.</speaker>
          <p> Thank'ee, sir, thank'ee !</p>
          <stage>(Following George about, and offering him the bread.</stage>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> Now, my dear, hey for Switzerland!</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> But I'm not packed up!</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> Never mind packing up; we'll do that on the road.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> What o'clock does the train start ?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> Train! Pooh—pooh—we'll walk.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
          <p> Walk, my dear!</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
          <p> Yes, every inch of the way, except between Dover and Calais, and that I mean to swim!
            Slide, my boy, you shall go with us, and what's more, I'll undertake to make a thinner
            man of you, and restore Mrs. Slide to your arms. I'll tell you how I'll do it—you shall
            carry me on your back to the top of Mont Blanc three times a day for a fortnight. So
            let's be off, and when I get back, if ever I do get back, I shall have this
            satisfaction, at least, that no one will be able to say of me, "How stout you're
            getting."</p>
