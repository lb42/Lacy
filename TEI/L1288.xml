    <stage>SCENE — A Drawing-room in Greywood Hall. A wide fire-place with sculptured mantel-piece,
     L., a wool fire on the hearth. A door, F. L. C. Other doors, R. and L. A large recessed window,
     gioing a view of a terrace overlooking Greywood Park, F. R. C. An easy chair near the fire.
     Table, with lamp, a tray with coffee, cups, &amp;c , L. C. Chairs, &amp;c. A coffee-pot by the
     fire-side. A console between the door and window in F., medicine bottles, &amp;c, on it. </stage>
    <stage> A Servant discovered arranging the lamp. Enter Mr. Merriton and Ralph Holden, D.L..
     talking. </stage>

     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p>Pah ! I know you can't bear Redway because he's an affable, clever fellow.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>Affable—because, in spite of his elegant manners, he is not above getting drunk with you at
      the Greywood Arms.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M6">

    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>And you think him clever because, in spite of your own talent as a billiard-player, he can
      almost beat you, playing blindfold.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M6">
     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p>Well, whatever he is—I like him.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>So much the worse for you. I should like to
      <pb n="4"/>know what he is doing in the neighbourhood still, now that his errand to Lady
      Belfield is done ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M6">
     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p>You think his errand <emph>is</emph> done ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>Unless his friend and confidant, Mr. Philip Rashleigh, has commissioned him to extort by
      force the ten thousand pounds which she has positively refused to lend to her graceless
      nephew, I don't see what further business he can have down here.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M6">
     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p>You're quite right, he hasn't any—in fact, he went back to London this afternoon.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>Pleasant journey to him, and hoping that he has not troubled himself to take a return
      ticket. The man alarms me on your account.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M6">
     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p>Ah! Well, it doesn't seem to me that Lady Belfield has treated Mr. Philip very kindly, in
      refusing him the money he sent Redway for.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>She has acted like a prudent woman. It is hardly five years since Philip Rashleigh came into
      his fortune of eighty thousand pounds, and a year ago, every penny of it had been squandered,
      in the devil only knows what round of vice and extravagance.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M6">
     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p>Well, it was his own; he had a right to spend it how he liked.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, and Lady Belfield's fortune is her own, to dispose of as she thinks best—and what she
      thinks best at present is, to refuse a halfpenny of it to Mr. Philip Rashleigh. Now, listen to
      me, Holden ; you and I were born in the same village ; you are the son of a worthy surgeon,
      who gave you an education which you have not made the most of—I am the son of a small farmer,
      who had me taught to read and write ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M6">
     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(sneeringly)</stage> And keep accounts.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>True; and I quickly learned that one can't earn one pound and spend two without getting into
      debt.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M6">
     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(impatiently)</stage> Oh ! you were always a model of prudence; step by step, you
      have become ironmaster, railway contractor, millionaire, and you are now looking about for a
      seat in Parliament. You have met with nothing but luck, I have had nothing but
      misfortunes.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>Misfortunes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M6">
     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p>Yes ; not the least of which is to be preached at by —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>By the man through whose interest you were appointed agent for the Greywood estate.</p>

     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p>From which post—you are, no doubt, going to

    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>But for the intercession of your daughter, for whom Lady Belfield has long shown an
      affectionate regard. Grace is a good girl, Holden.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M6">
     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p>My daughter is—what she ought to be</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>I wish as much could be said for her father.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M6">
     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p>Oh! are you going to begin again ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>I've something more to say to you. You know Lady Belfield's history ? The daughter and
      heiress of a Manchester manufacturer, about twenty years ago she married the late Lord
      Belfield, to whom she brought a fortune of a hundred thousand pounds. Lord Belfield was a very
      worthy nobleman, but that did not prevent his wife living unhappily with him.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M6">
     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p>I know all about that. Her husband's family turned up their aristocratic noses at her on one
      side, and on the other, her brother quarreled with Lord Belfield on political grounds ; the
      result of all being that young, handsome, and rich as she was —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>She was condemned to a life of exile—here in Cornwall.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M6">
     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p>Well, what need is there of telling me all this?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>I want you to understand that her illness is much more serious than is supposed. We must bo
      prepared for her death and, therefore—as, for the last two years, you have had the entire
      control of her money affairs —I am anxious to know, whether, in case she dies, you are
      prepared to render an account to her representatives.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M6">
     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p>Her representatives ? She will only leave <emph>one</emph>, her brother's son—Mr. Philip
      Rashleigh.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>That is to say, if she dies intestate.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M6">
     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(with a questioning look)</stage> Well, she —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>You, possibly, hope that she wiil not leave a will, because, with the help of your friend
      Redway, you think it would be easy enough to settle accounts with Mr. Philip Rashleigh.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M6">
     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p>Do you suppose she means to disinherit her nephew ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>Otherwise she need not have taken the trouble to make a will.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M6">
     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p>A will! She has made a will, then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>She has.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M6">
     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(aside)</stage> Redway's suspicion was well-founded, then ! <stage>(aloud)</stage>
      And to whom has she left her fortune ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>That's her affair ; but I am pretty sure Mr.
      <pb n="6"/>Philip Rashleigh will not pocket much, if any of it. Now whoever inherits, the
      settlement of accounts with them will not be so easy.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M6">
     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps not—especially if she has left her property to her husband's relatives ; to her
      sister-in-law, Lady Slowburn, who used to call her Lord Belfield's "housekeeper," and who has
      taken up her quarter at the Hall, with her daughter.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>It is for that reason I have given you warning. Nearly forty thousand pounds must have
      passed through your hands during the last three years, and the expenditure has not been more
      than a third of that sum.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M6">
     <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
     <p>Don't be at all uneasy, <stage>(a bell rings, without.)</stage>
     </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1288_M5">
     <speaker>Merri.</speaker>
     <p>That is her ladyship's bell. Do not leave the Hall; I may have more to tell you,
      by-and-bye.</p>

      she insisted on remaining up; then there was the old nurse, sent to sleep with the very

      when she is discovered almost red-handed, she flies from the Hall towards the sea,

      helpless on the sea shore, where you had fallen in rashly attempting to scale the cliff—You
      would have died, for the spot was so desolate that no human creature, not like me—in search of
      death— would have sought it. I found you bleeding, motionless, dying ; and the sight of
      death—which I had come to seek as a last resource—filled me with terror for your life,
      stranger as you were. My own trouble was forgotten in the thought of saving you. I stanched
      your wounds, brought you back to consciousness, and, weak as I was, dragged you beyond reach
      of the rising tide; then I sought help for you, and had you taken to the nearest house, where,
      for weeks, you lay between life and death.</p>

     <p><stage>(continuing)</stage> When I had seen you in safety, I turned away to seek my own
      destruction, but the words, "poor gentleman—he has not an hour to live," spoken by someone of
      those who were about your bedside, caught my ears. I looked once more at you, and the thought
      came into my mind that heaven had, perhaps, placed your life in my keeping. I stayed by you,
      and the next day—and for many days while death hung over you—you found me at your pillow.</p>

     <p>You were saved, and then I wished still to die, but I no longer had the courage. You had
      told me the story of your life—your labours, your hopes of fame and happiness; and when your
      strength was returning, and you walked in the open air and sunlight, resting on my arm, I felt
      proud that I had saved so rich a life. I was happy to see you live, and there were hours

      <p>Without exception ; that of the Lady Diana being made supreme—something lifted above the

      <p>The painter's highest ideal of beauty must —I imagine— always be the woman he loves ; and
       if, in the present day, he fails to produce on his canvas such lovely creatures as the
       Fornarina of Raphael, and the Joconda of Leonardo da Vinci, it is because he lacks the
       courage of the great Italian painters, who gloried in exhibiting to the world the objects of

      <p>I am lost! I am lost; In this monster's power, every moment of my life will be filled with
       terror worse than death. Uncertain whether my unhappy father lives or dies, I dare not give
       this wretch up to justice !—but he who has no scruples, whenever his own safety demands it,
       will denounce me ! No, no ; I cannot endure the thought of my miserable past being laid bare
       to Cyril's eyes ! Torn from his roof, he would drive me from his heart! Better a thousand
       times, that I should fly, no matter where, so that it be far, far away from all who may now
       recognise me and bring the dreadful truth to his knowledge ! Let me not hesitate. My jewels
       will buy me food, <stage>(rising, and suddenly pausing)</stage> My jewels ? Oh, no! they are
        <emph>his</emph> — everything, even to the dress I now wear, is Cyril's ! It would be
       robbery. But, if I beg my bread, I may be seized as a vagrant, questioned—my secret wrung
       from me ! Oh, heaven ! am I entirely helpless ? is there no way I can turn for relief from
       the great misery a father's sin has brought upon me ? no way but death ? I see none ! I see
       none! for I have not strength to battle longer with my fate. Forgive me, heaven!—forgive me,
