# TEI versions

This folder contains preliminary TEI-conformant transcriptions of randomly selected titles from the Lacy Acting Edition.

The texts have been converted from a variety of sources, but all have been checked for conformance to a simple TEI XML schema, which is documented in the ODD folder. They have also been checked against the DRACOR schema, with which they are not yet fully conformant. 

Scripts used to build the corpus are in the TEI/Scripts folder.
