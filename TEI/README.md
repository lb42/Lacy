# TEI versions

This folder contains preliminary TEI-conformant transcriptions of randomly selected titles from the Lacy Acting Edition.

The texts have been converted from a variety of sources, but all have been checked for conformance to a simple TEI XML schema, which is documented in the ODD folder.

Sources used and procedures followed are briefly documented in the appropriate part of each TEI Header.
