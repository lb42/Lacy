                    <p>Can't be better—in short, it quite reconciles me to Corsica, and that's
                        saying a good deal; for, I confess, when I was appointed Brigadier of
                        Carbineers, and left France for Corsica, I expected to find your Island as
                        bad as could be, and its inhabitants rather worse.</p>

                    <speaker>Brig.</speaker>
                    <p>Yes! and took it for granted that every Corsican cut a throat before
                        breakfast as a matter of course.</p>

                    <p>I heard something about an old family feud existing between your house and
                        that of—I forget the name; and knowing that it's the fashion in Corsica to
                        pay such old standing debts of hate sooner or later, either by a stab in the
                        back from a stiletto, or a bullet from a carbine through the head, why I
                        thought I'd keep my eye on you.</p>

                    <p>You look anxious and fidgetty. Come, there's something amiss—peahaps you're
                        beginning to repent having selected such a sweet tempered, lively, sociable

                    <p>I told you so. Ever since his return to Corsica, three weeks ago, he follows
                        your pretty daughter about like her shadow. Rosetta sees it—Bambogetti sees
                        it—everybody sees it but you, and you won't see it.</p>

                    <speaker>Fil.</speaker>
                    <p>Nonsense, Brigadier; Bambogetti is only a little out of humour because
                        Rosetta is on a visit to her aunt at Bastia; but she'll be home again
                        to-day, and then you'll see he'll be all smiles, jollity, and good humour
                        again.</p>

                    <p>Yes, sir, I'm a freeborn Briton, and what's rather more important, <pb n="5"/> a liveryman of the City of London. I landed yesterday at—at—</p>

                    <p>Bastia—that's it—Bastia—then I got into a sort of omnibus —they don't call it

                    <p>Exactly—and after a prodigious degree of jolting and a liberal supply of
                        dust, out I got at the entrance of your village, very sore, very thirsty,
                        and I may add, very considerably imposed upon by the conductor. I should
                        certainly have taken the fellow's number, only he hadn't got
                            one.</p>

                    <p>That's a sore subject. I beg to refer you for further particulars to this
                        gentleman. <stage>(shewing the Brigadier)</stage> One thing I can't help
                        remarking, and that is, that the few natives of this island of the masculine
                        gender, I have seen, are by no means handsome—<stage>(the Brigadier

                        common people—the riffraff—like that ill-looking individual there.
