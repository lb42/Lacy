     <l>Of course, you are; you proved by abdication, </l>

     <l>No more considered here, a cruel rub!</l>

     <l>That's true,</l>
     <l>I've no heart—I've lost it all to you.</l>
     <l>My old garotting habits from me thrusting,</l>
     <l>I've knuckled down, and giv'n up knuckle-dusting.</l>

     <l>I too succeding to the vacant throne ;</l>
     <l>Need we aught else?—yes, more than all we need : </l>
