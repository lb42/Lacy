     <head>Scene I.—The Dockyard at Saardam.</head>
    <stage type="setting">The Czar and Stanmitz discovered seated on a
      log of wood, and counting money. Czar L. H.; Stanmitz R. H.</stage>
    
    <sp who="#L0206_M1">
     <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
     <p>Well, well, what does it signify? You have to receive twelve ducats more than you expected;
      so let that content you.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M6">
     <speaker>Sta.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, but I'm puzzled—I'm bothered, you see; and I like— that is, I don't like—Look ye, my
      dear friend, Michloff, you want to persuade me that nineteen and twelve make twenty, and—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M1">
     <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
     <p>Ha, ha, ha! Look ye, my dear friend, Stanmitz, I am purse-bearer. I receive your month's
      pay—I lay out—and, at the month's end, I give you what remains; and so long as I don't attempt
      to persuade you that nineteen and twelve make fifty, you have no great reason to complain.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M6">
     <speaker>Sta.</speaker>
     <p>But look ye: I earn twenty ducats a month; you have laid out nineteen for me—and instead of
      one, which, according to my calculations, remains, you insist—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M1">
     <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (rises and comes forward)</stage>Plague take you, can't you put the money into your
      pocket, and be satisfied?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M6">
     <speaker>Sta.</speaker>
     <p>Well, I can't help saying it is very odd. Before you came to work here at the dockyard at
      Saardam, I had a hard tug to make both ends meet. It was as much as I could afford to get
      drunk three times a week, and not do the thing as it ought to be done either. Now, that you
      are paymaster, I can get drunk regularly every night; aye, and in a way to do any man credit,
      yet have always money to spare. Peter Michloff, your mode of managing all this puzzles me: and
      if you were not a devilish good fellow—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M1">
     <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
     <p>You'd take me to be the devil himself. Well, before I quit   this place, perhaps I may let
      you into my secret.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M6">
     <speaker>Sta.</speaker>
     <p>And do you think of leaving us?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M1">
     <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
     <p>I have now been absent from my native country a twelve-month. I have acquired some knowledge
      of shipbuilding, the object for which I came here, and it is time I should return home.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M6">
     <speaker>Sta.</speaker>
     <p>Our master, Mynheer Von Block, will be sorry to lose you, because you are the most
      industrious fellow in the yard: and I shall be sorry, because—hang it, Peter Michloff, I like
      you!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M1">
     <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
     <p>And, hang it, Peter Stanmitz, I don't dislike you.</p>
    </sp>  <pb n="4"/>
    <sp who="#L0206_M6">
     <speaker>Sta.</speaker>
     <p>Peter, you are my friend, and I think I may venture to let you into a secret.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M1">
     <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
     <p>That you are in love with Bertha, the pretty niece of Mynheer Von Dunder, the old blockhead
      of a burgomaster.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M6">
     <speaker>Sta.</speaker>
     <p>Not exactly that, but I'm told that old Von Dunder has lately been very busy in his
      enquiries about me, and that makes me uneasy.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M1">
     <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
     <p>Why, surely you have done nothing to be ashamed of?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M6">
     <speaker>Sta.</speaker>
     <p>No, not ashamed, but I'm cursedly afraid. But I'll tell you, I was born at Moscow.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M1">
     <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
     <p>Well, there is no crime in being born at Moscow; besides, that was no fault of yours.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M6">
     <speaker>Sta.</speaker>
     <p>That's not it. Listen! It happened one day that a party of soldiers halted near my mother's
      hut; the commanding officer presently cast an eye at me, and was so amazingly taken with my
      appearance, that he requested I'd make one of them. I was about to   decline, but assuring me
      that the Czar Peter, our name-sake you know, having particular occasion for my services, would
      take it as an offence if I refused the invitation, he forthwith clapped a musket on my
      shoulder, and marched me off.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M1">
     <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
     <p>Aye, you were enlisted.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M6">
     <speaker>Sta.</speaker>
     <p>Enlisted! Why I can't say but I was. Now, I was always an independent sort of fellow, fond
      of my own way, and couldn't stomach being ordered about against my inclination.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M1">
     <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (aside)</stage>So, so!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M6">
     <speaker>Sta.</speaker>
     <p>I put up with it a long while though; till one bitter cold morning in December, just at
      three o'clock, I was roused from my comfortable warm sleep to turn out, and mount guard on the
      bleak blustering corner of a rampart, in the snow. It was too bad— wasn't it?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M1">
     <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
     <p>Well?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M6">
     <speaker>Sta.</speaker>
     <p>Well, as I couldn't keep myself warm, I laid down my musket and began to walk: then I began
      to run, and hang me if I ceased running till I found myself five leagues away from the
      outposts.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M1">
     <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
     <p>So, then, you are a deserter!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M6">
     <speaker>Sta.</speaker>
     <p>A deserter! You call that being a deserter, do you? Well, putting this and that together, I
      shouldn't wonder if I am.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M1">
     <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
     <p>You know, my dear fellow, that if you are discovered, you will be shot.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M6">
     <speaker>Sta.</speaker>
     <p>I've some such idea. Indeed, it occurred to me at the time, so thinking it hardly worth
      while to be shot for being so short a distance,   as only five leagues away from my post, I
      made the best of my way to Saardam, and here I am.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M1">
     <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
     <p>This is an awkward affair, indeed, and if Mynheer Van Dunder, the Burgomaster, were informed
      of it—however, be assured your secret is safe in my keeping.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M6">
     <speaker>Sta.</speaker>
     <p>I don't doubt you, for I suspect you're in a similar scrape yourself.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M1">
     <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
     <p>I?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0206_M6">
     <speaker>Sta.</speaker>
     <p>There's something very mysterious about you, at any rate. No one knows who you are, or
      whence you come. And then, that strange man you have so many dealings with.</p>

     <p>Don't be uneasy, my little Peter. I dare say those gentlemen will be able to settle a treaty

     <p>Mischief, I am afraid, as it always is, when my uncle, Van Dunder, puts on what he calls his

     <p>That is yet secret; but it is in consequence of an order he has just received from
