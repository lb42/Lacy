     <stage type="setting"> Scene I —A fertile Valley near the City of Delhi, occupied as an
      extensive military post, the horse-platforms forming, in regular gradation, a passage over an
      immense mountain, over which fortifications appear thrown. Music. At the rising of the
      curtain, a body of Mahratta Troops appear in recumbent postures, their horses tied to trees
      and tents, while numerous pieces of cannon arranged at the different entrances, mark the scene
      to be the seat of war; the sun is seen to rise gradually over the distant mountains. </stage>

       <l>While gloomy thoughts dissolve away, </l>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Koz</speaker>
      <p> <stage>(r.)</stage>Welcome, noble chief! Thy presence gives fresh courage to our almost
       drooping spirits. Say, when shall we forth again and meet our bold oppressors? Lead us to the
       embattled plain, and there, by conquest, revive our faded laurels.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mol</speaker>
      <p> <stage>(l.)</stage>Aye, to the fight, great chief! defeat sits heavy at our hearts. To the
       fight! and with blood-stained swords, warm from our enemies breasts, wipe away our late
       disgrace!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>El H</speaker>
      <p> <stage>(c.)</stage> Disgrace! What tongue gives utterance to so foul a word?
       Disgrace!—were not their numbers treble ours? Did we not dispute each inch of ground ? Nor,
       e'er gave way till their overwhelming myriads swept us from the field: and then, no trophy
       did we leave—no! naught but tattered standards—gasping, mangled heroes, who, with their last
       breath did cry, " Allah protect the right -our cause is just— we die content!" Disgrace,
       indeed! <stage>(crosses L .)</stage></p>
      <pb n="4"/>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mol</speaker>
      <p> <stage>(c.) </stage>Your pardon, chief! I blush to think I gave loose to such expressions.
       But, defeat is a theme Moloc is not used to. Let Hyder but grant me pardon, and dearly shall
       that foe suffer who grave me cause for thus offending.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>El H</speaker>
      <p> Enough ! Moloc, your hand. Men with souls like thine are truly worthy Hyder's
       friendship.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Koz</speaker>
      <p>Now, then, chieftain, to business—the fight of yesterday—. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>El H</speaker>
      <p>Was, to the tyrant Hamet, a dear-bought victory.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Koz</speaker>
      <p> His losses double ours.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>El H</speaker>
      <p> True ! but they weigh but as a feather in the scale when compared to ours.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mol</speaker>
      <p>Hyder ! well you know our lives are devoted to the cause we raise our swords for. A hero's
       death draws forth a soldier's tears: but never must they fall to damp the soldier's
       spirit.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Koz</speaker>
      <p>No! rather let them urge us to revenge. But say, good Hyder, how do our young Prince and
       his royal mother bear the shock?—No answer! that averted head—speak, chieftain, and ease our
       fears—has any ill befallen our royal infant ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>El H</speaker>
      <p> He lives and is well.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mol</speaker>
      <p>Why those mysterious answers? Still silent! Does Hyder's band lack Hyder's confidence ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>El H</speaker>
      <p> No, no! Hyder's heart is too well known. The—the— the Princess and her son are
       prisoners.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Omnes</speaker>
      <p>Prisoners!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>El H</speaker>
      <p> Aye, prisoners to Hamet!—prisoners to that tyrant, who, by shedding the blood of sweet
       innocence, seeks to gain a throne, which, when he sits there, will become a throne of
       infamy—the seat of base pollution.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mol</speaker>
      <p>Our Princess a prisoner !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Koz</speaker>
      <p>El Hyder their guardian, too !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>El H</speaker>
      <p> Yes, Moloc, even so. But why these downcast eyes? Am I to read mistrust ? El Hyder doubted
       ! Did he not perform his duty?—Did he not protect his charge as long as man was man? Behold!
       are these not witnesses ? Will not these wounds, still reeking with my blood convey
       conviction to your minds ? Mark! here stood the tent that held my sacred charge,—far beyond
       our flank, stretched the enemy's horse—our wing was broken, overwhelmed, discomfitted—the
       Princess viewed it, and cried for Hyder —Hyder flew to them—we were surrounded—-foe on foe !
       I still maintained my ground, but they seized the Princess and her son- I heard their
       cries—saw them borne away—when I, with a Boa's rage, rushed to the rescue—a conquering arm
       struck me down- and Hyder saw no more !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mol</speaker>
      <p> Oh, Hyder, do not think we doubt you! Quick, comrades, from his mind dispel such
       thoughts—our country's love, our country's hope is——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Omnes</speaker>
      <p> Hyder!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>El H</speaker>
      <p> Oh grateful sounds! Comrades, your pardon—forgive but my hasty speech, and Hyder again is
       happy.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Koz</speaker>
      <p>And so would all around be, but that we fear Hamet's dreadful nature will lead him to a
       commission of crime—our Princess's life is endangered, unless a speedy rescue can secure
       her.</p>
      <pb n="5"/>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>El H</speaker>
      <p> Fear not, both their lives are safe—that I am surety for.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mol</speaker>
      <p>What mean you, chieftain ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>El H</speaker>
      <p> That I, your leader, am also Hamet's prisoner.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mol</speaker>
      <p>Confusion—explain!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>El H</speaker>
      <p> Peruse this scroll—it's contents speak volumes.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Mol</speaker>
      <p> <stage>(reads)</stage> " To the Chieftain, El Hyder: The chance of war has placed within
       my power the Princess Zada and her son—though my <hi>interest</hi> requires their
       <hi>death</hi>, (but Hyder's submission most), their lives are saved on Hyder's yielding
       himself a prisoner—but instant death attend on Hyder's refusal. Signed, <hi>Hamet.</hi>"
       Hyder then consented.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>El H</speaker>
      <p> And saved their lives—one hour alone is mine—I must then to the city, and, for the first
       time, yield myself a captive. Comrades, the brand of fierce destructive war must be
       extinguished! Each then to his home—partake of peaceful happiness, and when again my flag you
       see, I'll lead to death or victory.</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Aben</speaker>
      <p>There, madam, there lies your road. What, you would rebel—you would be free—dispute my
       authority, and bestow your hand upon a fellow, with no other recommendation than a handsome
       face and well turned limbs—a soldier, too, one of your here to-day and gone to-morrow men.
       No, no, madam, when you marry, the husband shall be of my choosing.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nina</speaker>
      <p>Then pray be quick, my dear guardy, for I'm determined to have a husband, and that very

     <sp>
      <speaker>Nina</speaker>
      <p>Certainly ! but then, I may, by chance, like to love some man better than all the sex

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Aben</speaker>
      <p>Ichander, I suppose, that fighting dog—that fellow who has joined the standard of the

      <p>True, true—but what signifies that to me ? has he not continued me in my office? am I not
       still master of the slaves, and governor of his harem ? a place of the utmost confidence and
       trust.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Nina</speaker>
      <p>True ! but if the Rajah knew of your wicked tricks in the harem, he would not trust you
       there any longer. Oh, guardy, guardy, for a man of your age—for shame, you know you are a bad
       man.</p>

      <speaker>Aben</speaker>
      <p>What does the girl mean ?</p>

      <p>Why, if you persist in locking me up in this sequestered

      <p>You may put your threat in execution as soon as you can: but that I shall take care to
       prevent. So, come along, madam, and here shall you remain, till I can find a man fool enough
       to marry you, and by getting himself into trouble, get me out of it. What ho !

       devil would have thought you could have been so easily gulled! What! did you think I was in
       earnest, and going to smash your head-rail ? Bless you, it was only in joke. We Englishmen
       know too well the blessings of liberty—their houses are their castles, and never will they
       infringe on the rights of others, which they would die to maintain themselves. Give us your

       I risk my kingdom's safety by these continued wars. No: the prince is now my prisoner, and

       the mistress of the island King, starve and rot upon a dunghill—let this be proclaimed as
       law—and death to him who breaks it. Nor shall here my vengeance cease—if but one voice is

      <speaker>Haf</speaker>
      <p>Come, I think that a pretty decent load for a man before breakfast. I wonder now whether
       this new trade of mine will answer? rather an odd change, I must confess—a soldier to a
       woodman; a cutter of throats to a cutter of sticks ; my sword to an axe; my war horse to a
       poor jackass, and all my former wishes for honours and wreaths and laurels, converted into a
       desire for a pair of panniers well crammed with faggots of cypress—but where's my companion
       in labour ? Osymn ! Osymn ! Oh ! there you are at your breakfast! Ecod ! he knows how to take
       care of himself. I did not know that I invited you to breakfast, <stage>(a gun fires)</stage>
       What the devil's that ? a gun! <stage>gun fires again) </stage>Again ! Mercy on me, what can
       it be ? <stage>(Zada screams, he looks off)</stage> A female and a child! and flying too,
       from the pursuit of an ugly looking villain as ever eyes beheld. Let me conceal myself
       awhile, and if I can, be of service to her. Hafez shall prove, that, though no great hero, he
       can act the man when helpless woman claims his aid. But, where can I hide ? Ecod! here's a
       place. A very snug one too. But first, let me take this, as I'm inclined to think it may
       prove useful.</p>
     </sp>
     <stage> Music — Hafez snatches up a bludgeon and enters the opening. Zada and Chereddin now
      enter. BEN TARAB rushes in, seizes the PRINCESS , struggles with her, turns her round and gets
      possession of the PRINCE , draws a pistol, and is about to shoot the PRINCE ,when Z ADA seizes
      him by the wrist, draws dagger from his girdle, and plunges it into his shoulder — the pain
      forces him to relinquish the Prince, and let fall the pistol, r.c. Zada exclaims " Fly, fly,
      Chereddin!" He does so, and begins to ascend the rock. By this time TARAB has drawn the dagger
      from his wound, and draws his sword. Zada retreats, he pursues, she screams — HAFEZ rushes
      out, and with his bludgeon knocks TARAB's sword out of his hand, as Zada faints into Hafez's
      left arm. By this time Chereddin has gained the bridge. TARAB makes an attempt to get his
      sword, but Hafez, with his bludgeon, stands on guard and makes a blow at him — he catches it,
      struggles with him, and throws him to the ground, and then taking advantage of this, ascends
      the rock, reaches the bridge, and seizes the child. Zada screams and falls upon her knees.
      TARAB stands exulting, and is about to dash the child into the torrent, when Zada sees the
      pistol BEN TARAB has dropped, and fires — he staggers and relinquishes his hold of the child —
      then falls into the water.

     <stage> Chereddin descends from the Bridge. Ben Tarab is seen striving to climb the rock, but
      falls in the attempt, and is hurried over the cataracts. Chereddin and Zada kneel and embrace.

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Haf</speaker>
      <p>Listen! come closer, will you ? El Hyder and the Princess are both close at hand. They met
       me in the forest this morning, and offered me two thousand gold rupees if I would contrive to
       get them past this barrier. This I consented to, told them I was your brother, could get the
       keys when I liked, and immediately claimed the rupees.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Hafn</speaker>
      <p>Well, and where are they ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Haf</speaker>
      <p>Safe in El Hyder's purse. Think you such a man as Hyder was to be tricked ? No, no—this was
       the bargain : the instant the barrier was opened, I was to receive the money. And then what
       did I intend to do, but this: having got the reward, I should have alarmed the guard, taken
       him prisoner, and claimed the other five thousand offered by the Rajah for his apprehension.
       But as you have in part discovered my plot, help me to complete it, and you shall have half
       with me.</p>
     </sp>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Hafn</speaker>
      <p>Stay, I think this will be a better plan: as this El Hyder is a cunning and daring man,
       perhaps as soon as he sees the barrier open, he will force his way, and do you out of the
       rupees—so to prevent this, you shall have a key off this bunch, <stage>(gives one)</stage>
       I'll retire into the guard-house, and as soon as you have got the money, give a loud cough,
       and then we'll rush out and seize him.</p>

      <p>Oh, it matters not, good Omar, where I rest—this flinty rock gives as much ease to my weary
       limbs, as the couch of down. But the mind, good Omar, the mind : what can relieve that when
       'tis oppressed with guilty fear ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Omar</speaker>
      <p>Talk not thus, great prince—the soul of Hamet should scorn to fear.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ham</speaker>
      <p>Have I not cause? this Chereddin </p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>Omar</speaker>
      <p>A child, without friends or protector—can he unnerve you thus?</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Ham</speaker>
      <p>But Hyder—is he not free, too ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Omar</speaker>
      <p>What of him? he is but a man. Oh, fie, my lord, you act unwisely. What can you expect of
       your soldiers, if their leader thus despairs ?</p>

     <pb n="23"/>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ham</speaker>
      <p>True, true—I am to blame. Return then, good Omar, to the palace—send forth fresh troops to
       aid me in my search: for, by Allah, he shall not escape me.</p>
     </sp>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>El H</speaker>
      <p> Aye, well—but here I heed not state nor person. Yon sparkling diadem would proclaim the
       monarch; but thy trembling frame denotes thee less than man.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ham</speaker>
      <p>And who art thou—and why am I thus assailed ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>El H</speaker>
      <p> Ask your own heart; and should it fail disclosing to you who, and whom you have deeply

      <speaker>El H</speaker>
      <p> Aye; thy mortal enemy—he, who thou did'st threaten -with lingering death—he, who, in
       despite of danger, did rescue young Chereddin from thy murderous grasp—he, who lives—still
       hopes to live—to check thee in thy career of guilt. Hamet, the triumph now is mine—you are in
       my power.</p>

      <p>Never! 'tis true, till now the breast of Hamet harboured fear; but thus surrounded, I hurl
       defiance at ye. Come on, then ; for thus I court a soldier's death.</p>

      <p> Hold! harm him not: his captivity will assist our cause.
       <pb n="24"/> Summon our troops to the plain—this instant will we advance against the city—his
       life shall depend on its submission. Where is the Prince?</p>

      <p>Here, noble chieftain.</p>

      <p>Yes, Hamet; and in his turn to triumph. Oh, mighty chieftain, lose not the present
       opportunity; but on to the attack, and let yon tyrant see his vanquished troops fly before
       our conquering arms,</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ham</speaker>
      <p>You talk well, lady: but take heed that you be not disappointed. Reckon not on my
       captivity; 'twill avail you nought. For sooner would I see my city enveloped in flames,
       myself its burning prey, than breathe one word of base submission. On, therefore, to your
       ruin, and with my death let me in joy exclaim, "my fall's revenged!"</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>El H</speaker>
      <p> Your vaunted courage shall be tried. March !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Zada</speaker>
      <p>Hold, Hyder ! let me partake this daring enterprise—foremost in the ranks, our royal self
       will boldly on, and thus inspire our troops with three-fold ardour. Come, Hyder, to the city.
       On this day's contest depends our Prince's crown.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>El H</speaker>
      <p> Well, be it so, lady. Comrades advance, and let the word be, "Our Prince's right, Death or
