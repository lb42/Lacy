   <head>The Garrick Fever.</head>
   <stage>Scene. A room in Mr. Hardup' s house, connected with the theatre, to which a door opens
    in flat, C.; door in R. H. flat, and doors R. and L. 2 E. </stage>
   <stage> Enter Hardup, R., and Undertone, C.</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Hardup.</speaker>
    <p>Well—well—any news? Any news? </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Under.</speaker>
    <p>None at all, sir. So, in this case, we can give the lie to the old proverb, for no news is
     anything but good news with us. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Hardup.</speaker>
    <p>What is to be done, Mr. Undertone ? </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Under.</speaker>
    <p>We are to be done, sir—brown! The game's up, sir—it's all over with us ! </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Hardup.</speaker>
    <p>What can it mean? There must have been some accident! There can be no mistake—the letters are
     clear enough ! <stage>(takes two letters out of his pocket.)</stage> Here is a copy of my own
     letter. <stage>(reads.)</stage> </p>
    <p>To Mr. Garrick.</p>
    <p>" Sir,—Understanding your engagement at the Theatre Royal, Dublin, will terminate on Saturday
     next, I beg to know whether it will answer your purpose to play six nights in this town, before
     your departure for England, commencing on Monday, with Hamlet. Share, above ten pounds. Clear
     Benefit, &amp;c. &amp;c." </p>
    <p>And here's the anwer. <stage>(reads.)</stage> </p>
    <p>" Dear Sir.—In reply to yours, just received, I have
     <pb n="4"/>only to say, <hi>yes </hi>!—with great pleasure. I will be with you
     <corr>between</corr> four and five, on Monday, which will just give me time to dress. </p>
    <p>" Yours, in great haste, </p>
    <p>"David Garrick."</p>
    <p>Addressed to " Mr. Hardup, Manager, Theatre Royal " </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Under.</speaker>
    <p>If that's not plain, I don't know what is. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Hardup.</speaker>
    <p>And here's five o'clock struck, and no tidings of him. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Under.</speaker>
    <p>The whole street is filled with people—the pit and gallery will overflow with the first rush.
    </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Hardup.</speaker>
    <p>And every place taken in the boxes—and a guinea offered for a chair behind the scenes! It's a
     fortune within my grasp! </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Under.</speaker>
    <p>And to be obliged to make an apology—return the money— </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Hardup.</speaker>
    <p>I can't do it, Mr. Undertone—it would break my heart! It's hard enough, in these times, to
     get money —to return it, is an impossibility! Why, I've gone to the expense of ten pounds in
     printing! Here's a bill! Here's an announcement! I flatter myself I've done it this time!
     <stage>(reads bill.)</stage> </p>
    <p>Theatre Royal, Ballinaslough. </p>
    <p>Unparalled Attraction ! First Appearance of the Immortal Mr Garrick! </p>
    <p>The Greatest Actor that ever was or ever will be!!! </p>
    <p>The Nobility, Gentry, and Public in general are respectfully informed that </p>
    <p>On Monday Next, </p>
    <p>Will be presented, with entirely new Scenery and Decorations, Shakespere's Tragedy of </p>
    <p>Hamlet, Prince Of Denmark, </p>
    <p>Or The Mad Son And The Murdered Father ! </p>
    <pb n="5"/>
    <p>The part of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark (the Mad Son), by that Inimitable Tragedian, Mr. David
     Garrick,(From the Theatres Royal Drury Lane, and Smock Alley,)who has been engaged for a
     limited number of nights. </p>
    <p>Nota Bene.—Mr. Garrick's attraction at the Theatre Royal Dublin, on his last visit to
     Ireland, was so great, that the crowded state of the Theatre produced an epidemic which was
     called </p>
    <p>The Garrick Fever! </p>
    <p>And, to use the words of that sublime Poet, The Late Mr. Alexander Pope to my Lord Orrery—"
     We may safely declare that Mr. Garrick never had his equal as an Actor, and will never have a
     Rival! </p>
    <p>There's a quotation for you! And from such an authority! </p>
    <stage> (handing bill to Undertone. </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Undertone.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(looking over bill.)</stage> But what does this mean, sir? <stage>(reading.)</stage>
     "The Ghost of Hamlet's Father, murdered by Mr. Hardup." </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Hardup.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(snatching bill.)</stage> Eh! What!—"murdered by "—confound the printers! One of their
     cursed blunders!—"The Ghost of Hamlet's murdered Father, by Mr. Hardup"—not "Father murdered."
     <stage>(noise of wheels without.)</stage> Hark!—there's a chaise! <stage>(running to
     window.)</stage> Yes! it stops here ! It must be he! The modern Roscius! The great Garrick!
    </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Under.</speaker>
    <p>I'm afraid not, sir. Mr. Garrick is a young man, and, as well as I can see, the person in the
     chaise is an old woman! </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Hardup.</speaker>
    <p>Lady O'Leary, by all that's disappointing! And her shadow, Major Derrydown! The devil fly
     away with them both! </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Under.</speaker>
    <p>Have they got a box ? </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Hardup.</speaker>
    <p>No—the major wrote too late—everything was gone. There'll be a famous scene with her
     ladyship. She comes forty miles, on purpose. Where's my daughter Polly? Polly! Polly Hardup! </p>
    <pb n="6"/>
    <stage> Enter Polly, L. D. </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Polly.</speaker>
    <p>Here I am, father.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Hardup.</speaker>
    <p>Run down stairs, Polly! There's your grand god-mother, Lady O'Leary at the door, in a
     post-chaise. She'll be in a fine passion when she learns there's no box for her. Tell her she
     shall have a chair in the orchestra— just behind the big drum.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Polly.</speaker>
    <p>She's coming up stairs. <stage>[Exit Polly, L. D. </stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Hardup.</speaker>
    <p>The deuce she is! Then I'll be off! Follow me, Undertone, into the theatre, and let's see all
     is ready before they open the doors.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Under.</speaker>
    <p>You will open the doors, then ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Hardup.</speaker>
    <p>At all hazards! He must come! He's sure to come, if he's alive!—if not—why, its no fault of
     ours. And if they tear up the benches, and break the chandelier, the county must pay the
     damage. I stick to the old text —"Vivant Rex and Regina! No money returned!"<note type="ed">"Vivant Rex et
     Regina" appears frequently on playbills of the Duopoly. No moneys returned" belongs to a later
     period. </note></p>
    <stage> [Exeunt hardup and undertone, c. d. </stage>
    <stage> Polly re-enters with Lady O'Leary, and MajorDerrydown, L. D. </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady O.</speaker>
    <p>No box! I shall expire! Why Major—</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p>My angel!—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady O.</speaker>
    <p>Do you hear what my god-daughter, Miss Polly Hardup, says, sir ? There is no box, and I must
     sit in the orchestra, behind the big drum !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p>Behind the big drum! I'll run the big drum through the body, before you shall submit to such
     an indignity—and the big drummer into the bargain.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Polly.</speaker>
    <p>My father's very sorry, my lady. If he had but known your ladyship wanted a box—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady O.</speaker>
    <p>Had but known! Why, Major—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p>My Venus!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady O.</speaker>
    <p>Do you hear that, sir ? If he had but known! as if you had not written to him three days ago,
     at my especial request.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p>It is as you say, exactly as if I had not written to him three days ago.</p>
    <pb n="7"/>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Polly.</speaker>
    <p>Of course it must be, sir—because you did not.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady O.</speaker>
    <p>Did not! Why, major—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p>My darling!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady O.</speaker>
    <p>Do you hear my god-daughter, Miss Polly Hardup, assert that you did not write, as I desired
     you ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p>Indeed I do. And if she don't retract the assertion, she shall give me the satisfaction of a
     gentleman.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Polly.</speaker>
    <p>I only know that the letter did not arrive till this morning. I took it in myself, and heard
     my father read it.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p>Oh, you only know that, don't you ? Then why didn't you say what you only knew, at first—and
     not what you didn't know ? Does the mere appearance of a postman prove that I didn't write it
     at the time specified ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady O.</speaker>
    <p>Where is Mr. Hardup? Let me see him instantly.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p>Ay—where is Mr. Hardup ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Polly.</speaker>
    <p>I'll send for him, my lady. If your ladyship will condescend to wait here, and excuse me, as
     I shall hardly have time to dress for my part—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady O.</speaker>
    <p>Your part, my child! What do you play, then?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Polly.</speaker>
    <p>Ophelia, madam! Only think, what an honour! to play Ophelia to Mr. Garrick's Hamlet!</p>
    <l>" The expectancy and rose of the fair state;</l>
    <l>The glass of fashion, and the mould of form— The observed of all observers! "</l>
    <p>I'll send my father to you directly, madam.</p>

    <stage>[ Exit Polly, C., singing. </stage>
   </sp>

    <speaker>Lady O.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(R.)</stage> The girl's crazy, in downright earnest!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(l.)</stage> It's the Garrick fever they speak of.</p>
    <p>You've a touch of it yourself, my darling.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady O.</speaker>
    <p>Dont call me your darling! If I find that it is through your negligence—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p>It's the blundhering postman—bad luck to him! But if I don't give him such a double knock on
     his
     <pb n="8"/>head as he never gave a street door, I'll give anybody leave to say I'm not Major
     Derrydown of the Loyal Westmeath Militia. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady O.</speaker>
    <p>If I do not see Garrick, I shall die. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p>You would not dream of it, would you ? Die for the sake of a dirty little play-actor, when
     you've promised to live to be Mrs. Major Derrydown. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady O.</speaker>
    <p>I have promised no such thing, sir. I have merely suffered you to hope. A dirty little
     play-actor! But what should a muddle-headed major of militia know of art or its professors ?
     Mr. Garrick, though a little man, is a great genius !—A man for whom duchesses are dying by
     dozens, sir! Read the bill, sir!—Read what the great poet, Pope, says of him, sir—" That he
     will never have a rival!" </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p>That will depend entirely upon whether or not he makes love to a certain beautiful creature
     of my acquaintance. For, by the powers, if he play Romeo to Lady O'Leary's Juliet, he'll have
     Major Derrydown for a rival, in spite of Pope or Pretender, as the saying is. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady O.</speaker>
    <p>Don't talk nonsense, Major! Where is Mr. Hardup ? It is nearly half-past five—the doors will
     be opened, and we shall get no seat. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p>This door leads to the theatre. Let's go in, and beat up his quarters. I'll teach him the
     respect due to a lady of quality, and a major of the Westmeath Militia. <stage>[Exeunt through

     sight of this bill, however, as I entered the town, gave me fresh spirits. Garrick is here
     !—the great, unrivalled Garrick ! If I could but get an engagement—were it only to carry a
     letter, or deliver a message; anything by which I might
     <pb n="9"/> meet the eye of the great Roscius, and, perhaps, obtain his approbation and
     patronage—who knows what might happen ?—He might take me with him to London—get me an
     appearance at Drury Lane—fancy our names in the same bill—" Duke of Gloster, Mr. Garrick.—The
     Lord Mayor, Mr. Gingle, from the Theatre Royal, Ballinaslough —(being his first appearance in

    <p>Shouldn't be at all surprised. But here I am, safe and sound ; though how I got here, I

    <p>Well, I'm astonished at my impudence, and frightened into the bargain, now I've done it. If
     anybody here should happen to know Mr. Garrick, what would become of me ? I shall never be able

    <p>I'm delighted you fancy it. It's from the King's Arms, over the way—a capital house. I've

   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Hardup.</speaker>
    <p>Don't be uneasy, sir; I've thought of everything. As luck would have it, Doctor Killmany, who
     is just your size, was in the stage box, in a new black velvet suit. I told him your
     predicament, and, in the handsomest manner possible, he volunteered to go home, and change his

    <p>" Dear sir, </p>
    <p>I have just discovered, to my great concern, that I have misdirected two letters, and sent
     you the answer to a dinner invitation from a friend a few miles out of Dublin. I enclose, in
     all haste, the note intended for you, declining, with many thanks, your liberal proposal, and
     trust it will arrive in time to prevent any disappointment to the public. </p>

   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady O.</speaker>
    <p>An excellent idea!</p>

    <p>You drunken rascal! You shall suffer for this!</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Gingle.</speaker>
    <p>Don't say so, sir! I hoped to make your fortune, and my own too. It's all the fault of the
     sherry— upon an empty stomach.</p>

    <p>Mr. Hardup. There's a terrible noise in front, sir. They're calling for the manager.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Hardup.</speaker>
    <p>I can't face 'em! Do you go, Mr. Undertone. Tell 'em—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Gingle.</speaker>
    <p>No—stop! I'll go! I don't mind an apple or two—and I'm getting sober fast.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Hardup.</speaker>
    <p>Go to the devil! They'll want their money again!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady O.</speaker>

    <speaker>Hardup.</speaker>
    <p>You, my lady? Why, it's a hundred and twenty pounds!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady O.</speaker>
    <p>I have promised my god-daughter, Miss Polly Hardup, to arrange matters between you, and I
     shall keep my word. The young man, I am assured, is not an habitual drunkard, and he may have
     talent in another line.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p>To judge from his figure he'd be better in Low Comedy, than High Tragedy.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Polly.</speaker>
    <p>Nay! you must own, father, that you said he was magnificent, even in Hamlet, as far as he
     went.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Hardup.</speaker>
    <p>Yes—because I thought he was Mr. Garrick —and of course—</p>
    <pb n="26"/>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Polly.</speaker>
    <p>And because he is not Mr. Garrick, you will say he has no merit at all.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Hardup.</speaker>
    <p>If he can get me out of this scrape with the audience, I'll say whatever you please.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Gingle.</speaker>
    <p>Done! It's a bargain! I'll go forward to them, and I'll say—</p>
    <p>" Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
    <p>" I throw myself on the generosity of an enlightened Public! I candidly confess to you that I
     am not the immortal Mr. Garrick! But, don't be angry! I assumed his name in the humble hope of
     affording you some entertainment. This is my first appearance in Hamlet. I took the part at a
     very short notice, and respectfully solicit the usual indulgence."</p>
