        <head>Scene I.</head>
        <stage>A Parlour in Cozy Cottage, Brompton, (2nd grooves) tastefully furnished; door of
          entrance, R. 1 E.; door of Todd’s room, L.1 E.; window, with curtains drawn, C. flat.—A
          large leather travelling case on chair, R. C.; carpet bag, hat case, bandboxes, and a pair
          of boots on the floor; fishing rod, telescope, and umbrellas scattered about the room,
          which exhibits the disorder indicative of preparation for a journey.  A table, C., on
          which is a writing desk, two candles lighted, a chamber candlestick unlighted, and work
          basket.  An arm chair, L., with concertina and case on it;—chairs R. and L. of
          table.</stage>
        <stage> Mrs. Todd and Perks the maid servant are engaged packing the travelling case on
          chair, R. </stage>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p> There, there, that will do.  My pink satin dress there; my handkerchiefs; my
            collars—</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Perks.</speaker>
          <p><stage>(snatching a pair of Wellington boots from the floor)</stage>  And here’s
            master’s new boots, mum, can’t you make a tiny bit of room for them between your lace
            cap and your Indian shawl?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p> Perks, I’m astonished at your suggesting such an association:—put them in the carpet
            bag.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Perks.</speaker>
          <p>Perks.  La, mum, there’s not room for a tooth-pick in the carpet bag; how we’re ever to
            get it’s jaws closed again I don’t know; and there’s a dressing case, and a box of
            cigars, and a fishing rod, and two umbrellas, a telescope and a pair of slippers, to be
            put up yet!</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p> Where’s my ugly?  What can have happened it?</p>
        </sp>
        <stage><pb n="4"/>Todd enters, L. 1 E., with a Bradshaw’s Guide in his hand.</stage>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> Here it is!  I’ve found it!</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T. </speaker>
          <p><stage>(R.)</stage>  My ugly?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p><stage>(L.)</stage>  No, my dear, our route.  I’ve been studying Bradshaw all the
            morning, and I find that if we leave—page 49—I mean, if we leave the Paddington—no—the
            Euston-square Station—at 7 o’clock, a.m., we can get by the Oxford Junction
              to—to—page—<stage>(turning over the leaves)</stage> page—page—no—that’s the Tilbury
            and Southend Line.  Ah! here it is!—we’re then to take the express train to—to
            York—where we meet the Midland Counties, you perceive, and then see—page
              74—<stage>(turning over the leaves)</stage> 74—74—74—74—where there’s a branch to the
            Eastern Counties that takes us to Norwich—and when we get to Norwich there’s a junction
            that takes us—somewhere—I don’t precisely know where—but I have a strong reliance on
            Bradshaw.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p> I wish you would put down Bradshaw, Todd, and exert the limited powers with which
            heaven has blessed you, and help me to pack and cord these things—you leave everything
            for me to do.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> My dear Laura, there’s the difference between us—you’re remarkable for physical
            energy—I for contemplative repose.  The study of Bradshaw fatigues one’s mind so.
              <stage>(Perks, who has been clearing off luggage, R., gets round at back to L. and
              takes up concertina from chair)</stage>  Mind that concertina, Perks—it’s the only
            instrument I play—<stage>(takes it from her, C.)</stage>, and having devoted myself for
            six months to “My Mary Ann,” I rather flatter myself I shall create an extraordinary
            sensation amongst the foreign echoes this summer. <stage>(he commences playing “My Mary
              Ann,” when a knock is heard)</stage>  Hah! who can this be?</p>
        </sp>
        <stage>Perks crosses at back and exits, R. 1 E.</stage>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p> I dare say my uncle Croker—come to bid us good bye.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> Your uncle, my dear, is a very worthy man.  I should feel bound to respect his
            venerable hairs, if he had any left to respect, but that hydropathic habit he has—of
            throwing cold water upon everything—is very disagreeable.</p>
        </sp>
        <stage><pb n="5"/>Enter Choker, R. 1 E., followed by Perks, who collects some of the
          scattered articles and carries them off, R. 1 E.</stage>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p><stage>(kissing Croker)</stage>  My dear uncle! <stage>(Croker crosses to
            C.)</stage></p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p><stage>(L. shaking his hand)</stage>  How d’ye do, Croker?  How are you?  Never saw you
            look so jolly in your life. <stage>(aside)</stage>  Dismal as a cherub on a tombstone! 
            It was very kind of you to call; we start on our tour in the morning, so you’re just in
            time to see the last of us.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Crok.</speaker>
          <p><stage>( C.)</stage>  The last of you!  Ah, Samuel, I hope there may be nothing
            prophetic in your words, but I have a melancholy foreboding—</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p><stage>(R.)</stage>  For goodness sake, uncle, don’t talk of melancholy
            forebodings—when we are looking forward to the Continent.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> Aye, what do you think of six months amidst the classic scenes of Italy.  Fancy
            smoking a cigar on the summit of Vesuvius; think of dancing the Tarantula amidst the
            ruins of Pompeii; imagine the delicious maccaroni—and the lazzaroni—and all the other
            oni’s. <stage>(forgetting himself)</stage>  Picture to yourself the indescribable
            rapture of floating on the moonlit sea with a lovely creature beside you.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p><stage>(indignantly)</stage>  Mr. Todd!</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p><stage>(recollecting himself crosses C. to Mrs. Todd)</stage>  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!  Of
            course my dear, I was thinking of you—idealizing you as it were—in a poetic dream.
              <stage>(crosses back to L.)</stage>  By the bye, Croker, is there anything we can do
            for you abroad?  We expect to be in Boulogne to-morrow night.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Crok.</speaker>
          <p><stage>( C.)</stage>  Well, I don’t wish to alarm you—but I had once a dear friend who
            was lost in crossing to Boulogne.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p><stage>(L.)</stage>  Lost! hem! dear me!  But with a good steamer you’re tolerably
            safe, I believe.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Crok.</speaker>
          <p>Crok.  I’ve heard of several appalling catastrophes to steamers.  Now, if you’d like to
            hear a few of them. <stage>(sits on L. of table, C.)</stage></p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p><stage>(seated R. of table)</stage>  Oh, dear, no!  Don’t trouble yourself, uncle.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Crok.</speaker>
          <p>Crok.  The trouble is nothing; it is to me always a melancholy pleasure to prepare my
            friends for the worst.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p><stage>(seated in arm chair, L.)</stage>  We’re very much obliged to you—but we’d
            rather have it without preparation.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p> Do you know, uncle, we purpose crossing the Alps into Italy?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Crok.</speaker>
          <p>Crok.  It was but yesterday I was reading of a party of six young Englishmen being
            buried beneath an avalanche on the great St. Bernard.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> Buried—alive?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Crok.</speaker>
          <p>Crok.  Alive.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> B—b—but it don’t often happen, does it?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Crok.</speaker>
          <p>Crok.  Continually, at this season.  Ask Albert Smith; <emph>he</emph> knows:—and what
            is most distressing, they all leave large families—of creditors to deplore their
            loss.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> I’m not naturally timid; but these things are sufficient to shake the stoutest
            heart.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Crok.</speaker>
          <p>Crok.  Take my advice, Samuel, and stay in your own country.  If you must travel—if you
            must go to the seaside—have you not Gravesend, Southend, and Mile-end?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> Oh, but you know, if one never moves from one’s native shore, one might as well
            be born a muscle—or a barnacle!</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p> Besides, my dear uncle, it’s now too late to alter our arrangements.  What would they
            say at Brompton if we went to Margate, with a passport for Naples?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Crok.</speaker>
          <p>Crok.  Have you considered the practices of the Italian innkeepers, who skin an
            Englishman alive, when they catch him?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> I shan’t mind that; I’ve undergone the operation so frequently in our own happy
            country.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Crok.</speaker>
          <p>Crok.  Then there’s the danger of the roads.  I don’t want to alarm you; but I had a
            dear friend once, who was travelling with his young wife, as you might be, to
            Naples—</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> To Naples?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Crok.</speaker>
          <p>Crok.  To Naples—where they were stopped in a lonely mountain road by brigands.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> Did you say—by—brigands?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Crok.</speaker>
          <p><pb n="7"/>Crok.  Twenty of them—all armed to the teeth.  Their captain, a ferociously
            handsome-looking scoundrel, clapped a carbine to my unfortunate friend’s head—and—</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p><stage>(earnestly)</stage>  Blew out his brains?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Crok.</speaker>
          <p>Crok.  All that heaven had granted to him.</p>

            Laura, my dear; on reflection, hadn’t we better confine our views to Margate, this

        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> Of course not, my dear—I’m fully aware of the steadiness of your purpose; but
            might it not be prudent—a—that is—a—advisable, to pause.</p>
        </sp>

          <p>Croker’s suggestion about arranging my worldly affairs should not be neglected.
              <stage>(sits at L. of table and takes papers out of writing-desk)</stage>  I have some
            papers and documents here which I must put in order before I depart for “that
            undiscovered bourne from whence no traveller gets a return ticket.”  Pshaw!  I must not
            let the dismal forebodings of old Croker prey upon me!  Now! think of it, I’ll light one
            of those Turkish cigarettes, which my friend, Captain Crasher, brought home from the
            East.  He tells me they’re prepared with opium and produce the most tranquillizing
            effect on the spirits. <stage>(he takes a cigar case from the table drawer and lights a
              cigarette)</stage>  This I hope will restore the serenity of my mind.  Be a man, Todd!
            be a man!  Croker’s an ass!  He and his stories may go to the devil. <stage>(smoking and
              arranging his papers)</stage>  Humph! ha! pooh! capital weed! <stage>(taking up a
              bundle of papers)</stage>  What are these?  “Accounts settled.”  Um! um! <stage>(puts
              them down and takes up another parcel, turning them over)</stage>  Mrs. Todd’s letters
            to me when we were courting.  Ah! delicious smoke!  A lock of her silken hair!
              <stage>(smoking)</stage>  How beautifully it curls! and this brown sprig of myrtle,
            which she wore the night we vowed to love for ever.  Ha! we were green then!  Her eyes
            remind me of—<stage>(reading endorsement on another document)</stage>  “The last will
            and testament of Samuel Todd.”  Dear me! what a sudden chill the sight of this solemn
            instrument brings over me.  The paper looks so ghastly white, and the ink so deadly
            black; that, gazing at it as I sit here, seems like staring in the face of my own
            ghost.  Pshaw!  I’ll not give way to these desponding fancies! <stage>(smoking)</stage> 
            By the bye, I may as well add a codicil to my will.  I’ve been thinking about it for
            some time; no one can tell what may happen.  Let me see—<stage>(running over the
              will)</stage> “I give and bequeath <pb n="9"/>all that and those”—um, um, um, um, um,
            um—“three per cent. consols”—um, um, um—“Shares in the”—um, um, um—“bank stock, goods,
            and chattels, to my beloved wife, Laura,”—um, um, um!  Now for the codicil,
              <stage>(writes)</stage> “Provided always, that if my said wife shall survive me, and
            shall intermarry with a second husband, I hereby revoke all and every of the bequests
            hereinbefore contained.”  That’s only justice!  If it was my misfortune to be left a gay
            widower—would I marry again? never!  At least, not until I had reflected
            seriously—and—pooh!  Deliciously soothing this cigarette!—not until, I had weighed in my
            mind,—the—delightful aroma, and the—object however lovely, with—the memory of the dear
            departed,—and the natural—weakness of—of—my head—no—my heart—and conjugal affection.—I’m
            coming—my dear—com—ing!</p>
        </sp>
        <stage>Music—The cigarette falls from his lips, and he sinks fast asleep with his head on
          the desk before him.  Lights down, and the scene gradually changes—Todd sinking through

          <p> No, in search of pleasure; my wife’s dead—my adored Laura <stage>(plays a few

        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> The strangest one in the world; you must know I rode out from Naples this
            morning to visit a celebrated ruin in this neighbourhood;—I’m fond of ruins, when
            they’re in a perfect state!  I was mounted on my guide, while a mule carried my
            umbrella—no, I’m wrong, I was mounted on my umbrella, while the guide carried the <pb n="11"/>mule—no, I’m wrong again—for ’twas the mule carried <emph>me</emph>.  Well, I
            was riding along enjoying myself wonderfully, thinking of my lost Laura, when, bang came
            a bullet through my hat! <stage>(takes off his hat and puts his finger through a hole in

          <p><stage>(laughing, aside)</stage>  My uncle’s usual way of requesting travellers to

        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> In the agitation of the moment I unconsciously drew a pistol from my belt—it
            went off spontaneously—I heard an awful groan.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mari.</speaker>
          <p> A groan?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> A groan that made me tumble from my mule and roll down a tremendous precipice by
            the roadside:—a torrent roared at the bottom, in which I should have inevitably finished
            my tour, if my concertina had not luckily got entangled in the roots of an old tree,
            where I hung nearly strangled till evening, when I managed to extricate myself and crawl
            through the wood, until I found a path, which led me to this hospitable abode.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mari.</speaker>
          <p> Then you have no idea where you are?</p>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> Not the remotest; but I can always make myself at home wherever I go.  You don’t
            live quite alone in this tumble-down old place?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mari.</speaker>
          <p> No, I have an uncle, who resides here.</p>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> Oh! <stage>(half aside)</stage>  A joint proprietor with the rats and owls.  And
            what is this uncle of yours, my dear?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mari.</speaker>
          <p> Hem! he has something to do with taxes on the road.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> I know:—a collector of Highway Rates.  One of the family used to call regularly
            upon me at Cozy Cottage, Brompton.  The fellow used to bring the Gas and the Sewers with
            him, and when the Sewers came, I was certain the Thames Water Company was not far off. 
            Your name, sweet flower?</p>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> Marietta!  Do you know, Marietta, you bear a striking resemblance to my lost
            Laura—you have her eyes exactly, only yours are darker—the same nose, only yours differs
            in shape—the same mouth, only yours is smaller.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mari.</speaker>
          <p><stage>(laughing, aside)</stage>  A ridiculous creature! but I must try and get him out
            of the trap, into which he has unconsciously walked.  Signor, you must not remain here. 
            If my uncle returns and finds you, it may be worse for you, and where to put you for the
            night I don’t know.  Hah!  I have it:—you shall sleep in the fowl house—there
              <stage>(points through window at back)</stage> on the opposite side of the garden.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> The fowl house!  You could never think of putting me to bed amongst the cocks
            and hens, consider my feelings.  Bless me! what a look of my lost Laura!

        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p> Yes, on my journey to Naples, in search of my husband, when my vetturino was
            overturned at the foot of the hill.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Jaco.</speaker>
          <p>Jaco.  Accidents do frequently happen to carriages at that particular spot.  But my

        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p> I never received greater attention in my life.  That gentleman took charge of my

          <speaker>Jaco.</speaker>
          <p>Jaco.  To-morrow we can talk about it.  You must pardon our rough housekeeping; but my
            niece, Marietta, will wait upon you. <stage>(Marietta, L., curtseys)</stage>  Marietta!
            go and fetch the signora’s travelling bag; she will honour us by taking a bed here
            to-night.</p>

          <p><stage>(R. C.)</stage>  You said you were travelling in search of your husband,
            signora; may I inquire how you came to be separated?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p> Well, it’s a strange story.  Mr. Todd and myself, wishing for a little continental
            air, set out on a foreign tour last spring, and got as far as Genoa, where we saw the
            mole;—but it’s no more like a mole than I am:—and nothing would serve Todd but we should
            have a sail on the bay, though he knew the sea always upset me—and it <emph>did</emph>
            upset me—it upset us all—for our boat was overturned by a squall, and I should
            inevitably have died an amphibious death, if I had not clung instinctively to life;—and
            a vigorous sailor, who swam—and swam—and swam, until we were fortunately picked up by
            the boat of a steamer, bound to Marseilles, where I was safely landed.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Jaco.</speaker>
          <p>Jaco.  And your husband?—</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p> I learned that he too had been saved; but imagining I had met a watery end, he went
            into mourning for my loss, and to divert his melancholy, had continued his tour.  I
            immediately set off for Italy, and succeeded in tracing him to Naples, where I was going
            when—</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Jaco.</speaker>
          <p>Jaco.  That fortunate accident happened to your carriage.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p> Fortunate?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Jaco.</speaker>
          <p>Jaco.  Undoubtedly, signora—since it has procured me the pleasure of your company.</p>

          <speaker>Jaco.</speaker>
          <p><stage>(R. apart to Grimbaldi)</stage>  Ha! he must not be neglected.  I’ll just fetch
            my pistols and follow you directly. <stage>(to Mrs. Todd)</stage>  Addio, signora!  A
            little business calls me away; but I shall soon return.  Your chamber is in that
            corridor <stage>(points to L. 2 E.)</stage>  First door on the right—addio!
              <stage>(kisses her hand)</stage>  Ha, ah!</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p> Good night, signor.  I accept your hospitality gratefully for this night; to-morrow
            morning I resume my journey.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Jaco.</speaker>
          <p>Jaco.  Oh! you must not think of leaving us so soon; none of our friends do—they feel
            themselves so happy here. <stage>Exit, R.</stage></p>

        <stage> 3 E.  Grimbaldi then makes several awkward bows, and exit R. 2 E. </stage>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p> There’s something I don’t quite like in this house, and the people about it.  I never
            saw a more ill-looking person than that major-domo; the way they took possession of my
            trunks, and trinkets—good gracious! if they should be brigands! <stage>(she looks about
              the room, and runs to door, L. 3 E., which she opens, goes in and returns
              immediately)</stage>  No more doubt—I’m in a robber’s den!  That room is full of
            plunder and arms!  What is to become of me?  That dreadful man—his looks—his words—Oh! 
            I must endeavour to escape at all hazards—better wander all night in the forest than
            remain another moment in this fearful place.</p>
          <stage>She is crossing to R., when Marietta enters, R. 2 E., with carpet bag.</stage>
          <p>Ah, the girl!</p>

          <p><stage>(R. C.)</stage>  Here’s your carpet bag, signora. <stage>(puts it down,
              R.)</stage>  Bless me! how pale and agitated you look. <stage>(aside)</stage>  Can she
            have discovered!</p>

          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p><stage>(L. C., aside)</stage>  She speaks and looks kindly, and may assist me. 
            Marietta, I know all—I have looked into that room—and I have seen—</p>

          <speaker>Mari.</speaker>
          <p><stage>(alarmed)</stage>  Hush, hush—my uncle!</p>

        <sp>
          <speaker>Mari.</speaker>
          <p> Impossible, signora.  My uncle never goes out that he don’t lock all the doors

        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p> But there are windows, Marietta, and here is one. <stage>(going towards it, is
              withheld by Marietta)</stage></p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mari.</speaker>
          <p> Stop—stop!—Would you kill yourself!  Hah!  I have it!  There is a rope ladder
            here, <stage>(going into room, L. 3 E., and returning with a rope ladder)</stage>  By
            means of this ladder you can descend into the garden, and remain concealed there till

        <sp>
         <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p><stage>(L.)</stage>  How kind of you, how very kind—but perhaps one day I may be
            able to show my gratitude.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mari.</speaker>
          <p><stage>(R.)</stage>  Don’t mention it.  How surprised my uncle will be when he finds
            you’re gone. <stage>(putting bottle of wine and two glasses on table—a whistle is heard
              outside)</stage>  What whistle is that?  Don’t be alarmed, I’ll go and look out.</p>
        </sp>
        <stage>Exit hastily, R. 2 E.</stage>

          <p><stage>(goes to window, and perceives ladder of ropes)</stage>  Hah!—What’s this?  A
            very pretty contrivance—I suppose, when love can’t get in at the door, he flies in at
            the window—and here are his wings, <stage>(holding the rope ladder to view)</stage>  And
            this hat. <stage>(taking it off chair, R. C.)</stage>  Pretty, innocent creature!  He’s
            here, then.—<stage>(Marietta clasps her hands)</stage>  Humph!  Surely I have seen this
            hat somewhere—Ha! this morning—and it was the devil who then wore it—or an Englishman!
              <stage>(Marietta drops on her knees, crying)</stage>  Here’s the hole made by my

            beheld you at your window, and discovered the ladder you had placed.</p>

          <p><stage>(L. C.)</stage>  In my country, ever since the invention of doors, the practice
            of entering a house by the window has been confined to thieves, cats, and lovers;
              <stage>(tenderly)</stage> need I say, it was in the character of the last-named
            interesting quadruped, I risked my neck in the most perilous performance I ever
            attempted on the slack-rope. <stage>(Mrs. Todd makes a gesture of astonishment; up
              stage, L.)</stage>  Sweet Marietta!  How I admire that name!  It’s much prettier than
            Laura.  What’s your opinion of Samuel?  Do you think, in the ardent simplicity of your
            exalted nature, you could love a Samuel—or a Sam—or a Sammy, for instance?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>

          <p> Never! <stage>(sees Jacopo, R. 3 E., who holds up his finger
              threateningly)</stage>  Hem!  I—can’t say—perhaps, after supper.  You have not
            supped?</p>

          <p>Supper!—and I’m actually going to sup <emph>tête à tête</emph> with an angel, in this
            picturesque but dilapidated mansion.  What would they say at Brompton if they could see
            me?  Hah! <pb n="19"/>they won’t believe me, though—when I tell them—they’ll say it was
            an Arabian Night’s entertainment.  Ha! ha! ha!  Poor fools! that’s the way they always
            sneer at travellers. <stage>(sniffs)</stage>  As if that delicious odour of something
            uncommonly nice which assails my nostrils could be a dream.</p>

              <stage>(Marietta helps him to some of the stew)</stage>  And this stew is really so
            tempting!  I’ll make no apology. <stage>(eats greedily)</stage>  Never tasted anything
            so savory.  Game—eh?  Delicious!  How d’ye make it?  Infinitely superior to my lost
            Laura’s giblet pie!  What a flavour!  Ah! this is happiness!  I’ll take another
            spoonful, if you please.  Hah!  I begin to feel I’m a lonely cockle on life’s dull
            shore.</p>

            the image of my lost Laura has been growing fainter and fainter in my bosom—like a faded
            daguerreotype—mushrooms, I perceive—and when I gaze on that beauteous face—<stage>(he

          <p> What a discovery I have made!  Samuel, my husband, who I fondly fancied passed his
            nights watering his lonely pillow with his tears, and his days in writing elegies to the
            memory of a beloved wife, to have forgotten me so soon.  Not three months a widower, and
            the unconscionable wretch has ideas of entering the marriage state again.  I flattered
            myself my system of matrimonial discipline would have deterred him from a repetition of
            such folly.  But some men are never to be taught.  How he got into this house, I can’t
            imagine—but the object of his visit is apparent; he comes to make love to the Signor’s
            niece—a pastime that I shall take the liberty of interrupting.</p>

            over those papers, <stage>(goes to table, C.)</stage> and you’ve been smoking a filthy
            cigar.</p>
        </sp>

          <p> An opium cigar! that’s it!  Then I’m not a brigand with two wives!  Laura, my
            love, come to the arms of your doting husband. <stage>(they embrace—door bell rings
              outside)</stage></p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p> There’s the policeman who was to ring the bell at five o’clock.  You know we start at
            six.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp>
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> Oh, yes, to be sure!  I’ll be ready in five minutes.  But first a word with our
            friends. <stage>(to audience)</stage>  If I have been dreaming that you are pleased,
            pray don’t dispel so pleasant an illusion—but, with your usual good nature—give me a
            lucky omen for my dream to-night and to-morrow.—“What will they say at Brompton?”</p>
