    <head>Scene First.— Study of the Author—a handsome apartment, comfortably furnished. Bookshelves—table
     covered with papers, pens, ink, &amp;c.; doors R. and L. ; mysterious music.</head>
    <stage>Enter from L. door, the Author, he is smoking a cigar—he walks up and down the room for
     some moments—pauses and hits his forehead.</stage>

     <l>I've got it! No, I haven't—wish I had.</l>
     <l>Hum! my position's really rather sad ;</l>
     <l>I am an author—pity if you can, </l>
     <l>I need it more than any <hi>author</hi> man.</l>
     <l>T'wards winter time the agonies increase </l>
     <l>Of those, who like me have to find a piece</l>
     <l>For Christmas, and I can't a subject get;—</l>
     <l>I haven't got the smallest piece as yet.</l>
     <l>I've worked most certainly, but I must say </l>
     <l>At present it's been all work and no play.</l>
     <stage>(goes to table and sits)</stage>
     <l>The mighty Molière, I have heard it said, </l>
     <l>To his old housekeeper his dramas read. </l>
     <l>Her critical remarks determined what </l>

     <l>Would make them more effective. I, <stage>(rises)</stage> like him, </l>

      down to front)</stage>
     <stage>Enter Mrs. Brown, R. door, a Gampish<note>Mrs Gamp first appears in Dickens Martin Chuzzlewit (1843-4)</note> elderly female.</stage>
     <l>Come, Mrs. Brown, ma'am, your advice is needed. </l>

     <l>Which when the bell rung and it frighten me did, </l>

     <l>A drawback—going through me like a knife— </l>
     <l>I was a sittin' down to—I declare— </l>
     <l>As nice a hand of pork as ever were, </l>
     <l>Which it is not my habit, beyond question, </l>
     <l>To suppers eat, because of indigestion, </l>
     <l>Which troubled with I've been, I must admit, </l>
     <l>Since a mere infant; "but a little bit," </l>
     <l>Says Mrs. Mivins, sir, a friend of mine</l>
     <l>She is, and lives at number thirty-nine </l>
     <l>Little Godolphin-street, just past the baker's, </l>
     <l>And almost opposite the undertaker's.</l>
     <l>"A little bit," she says, says she, "won't do </l>
     <l>No harm to me, mum—no—nor yet to you, </l>
     <l>Which little 'appiness you ever get." </l>
     <l>And there, upon the instant, off she set </l>
     <l>Together <hi>with</hi> a basin <hi>and</hi> a saucer, </l>
     <l>Which the biled pork till nine from half-past four, sir, </l>
     <l>Is, as a body might say, "laid on;" which, </l>
     <l>A simmering for hours, it gets that rich, </l>
     <l>Not to say juicy, as makes party's feel </l>
     <l>That 'ungry, which it's an unwholesome meal</l>
     <l>Of that I am aware, but werry nice,</l>
     <l>And if I might suggest an 'umble slice— </l>
     <l>If not, you won't consider me too bold, </l>
     <l>But pork's a nasty knack of getting cold.</l>

     <l>Oh ! why the diggins didn't he, I wonder.</l>
     <l>He might have died, and let his wife forget him ;</l>
