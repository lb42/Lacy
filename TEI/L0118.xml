   <stage type="setting"> Scene.—A handsomely furnished Apartment. Doors in flat, R. and L. C.
    Another door, L. 2 E. Piano-forte, table, chairs, &amp;c. </stage>
   <stage> Mrs. Mouser seated at table, working. Mouser, in a dressing gown, seated at piano-forte,
    R. </stage>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <stage>(accompanying himself, and singing)</stage>
    <l> “On the margin of fair Zurich’s waters, </l>
    <l> Ya—oo—oo!” </l>
    <p>That isn’t quite the thing. (repeating) Ya—oo—oo! That’s more like it! </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_F3">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(throws down her work)</stage> This is really intolerable! I wish you wouldn’t attempt
     to sing that song, Mr. Mouser. You’ll never accomplish it. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p>I <emph>will</emph> accomplish it, Mrs. Mouser. Indeed, I may say, I <emph>have</emph>
     accomplished it—all, except the “Ya—oo—oo,” and I’m not going to be beat by a “Ya—oo—oo,” I can
     tell you. No, Mrs. Mouser, I’ll accomplish that “Ya—oo—oo,” if I die for it! <stage>(very loud,
     and out of tune)</stage> “Ya—oo—oo!” No—that’s worse than ever. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_F3">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p>It’s quite clear that you are determined to annoy me.<stage>(pouting)</stage> </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(comes down quickly; very tenderly)</stage> Annoy you? <emph>You</emph>, my Anastasia?
     <emph>You?</emph> Pooh! </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_F3">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p>I’ve told you a hundred times, Marmaduke, that you haven’t a single note in your voice. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p>Then the more creditable in your Marmaduke to try and get a few. <stage>(in a solemn
     tone)</stage> Anastasia, we live in a wonderful age. Every thing we see above us, below us, and
     all round about us, proclaims the triumph of mind over matter. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_F3">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(yawns slightly)</stage> Well, I don’t deny it, do I? </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p>You <emph>can’t</emph> deny it. Look at the Railroads—oblige me by looking at the Railroads,
     with their gigantic viaducts, their stupendous aqueducts—look at the Electric Telegraph over
     the Straits of Menai—look at the Tubular Bridge under the Straits of Dover! And how—how is this
     done? By perseverance—by determination! And shall I flinch from a paltry obstacle? Never! So
     here goes again! <stage>(very loud)</stage> “Ya—oo—oo!” </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_F3">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(listening)</stage> Hark! </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p>What? </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_F3">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p>I thought I heard my dear Cousin Crummy outside. But of course that would give
     <emph>you</emph> no gratification. </p>
   </sp>
   <pb n="4"/>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p>You wrong me, Anastasia. As long as your Cousin Crummy is outside, and <emph>keeps</emph>
     outside, I don’t care how often I hear him. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_F3">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(severely)</stage> Mr. Mouser! </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p>Understand me, Anastasia, I mean no disrespect to your Cousin Crummy—on the contrary,
     Crummy’s a man I like—but Crummy’s like many other good things in this world, a little of him
     goes a long way. In short, he gives us too much of his society. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_F3">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p>Because he sees we are so much alone. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p>But we never are alone. Crummy won’t let us be alone. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_F3">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p>Well, isn’t it natural that he should drop in upon us? Isn’t he your partner in the business?
     Isn’t he one of the firm, Mouser and Crummy, Attorneys-at-law? </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p>Yes, and why? Because you chose to fancy that my practice was more than I could get through,
     and that I required a partner. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_F3">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p>I confess I did, and you took him in. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p>I beg your pardon—he took <emph>me</emph> in; and pretty considerably too, for he pockets
     half the profits, and leaves me all the work. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_F3">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p>How can you say so? Isn’t he gone out on business now—and all the way to Pentonville, too?
    </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p>All the way from Islington to Pentonville! </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_F3">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p>Then why didn’t you go yourself? <stage>(rises)</stage> </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p>And leave <emph>you</emph>, my ’Stasia? <stage>(tenderly)</stage> You that I adore with a
     degree of intensity closely bordering on insanity! Besides, it isn’t because a Mrs. Jones from
     Northamptonshire—a Jones I don’t know—a Jones I never saw—a Jones I never even heard of,
     chooses to send for me, that therefore I must go to that Jones, Jones can’t expect it! </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_F3">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(r.)</stage> But no doubt she wishes to consult you on business, and she might prove
     an excellent client. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(L.)</stage> I hate business! I hate clients! I hate everything in the world but you,
     my ’Stasia. What’s the world to me? Nothing! What are its “gay and festive scenes, its halls of
     dazzling light” to me? Nothing! Oh, ’Stasia! ’Stasia! </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_F3">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p>What nonsense you talk. One would suppose we had only been married a week instead of a year.
     Has any one been here for me? </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(eagerly)</stage> Any one! Not that I know of. Who do you expect? </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_F3">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p>Why only the laundress with my veil. She promised faithfully to let me have it to-day. When
     you go out, perhaps you will just call, and say I’m waiting for it. It’s only just over the
     way. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p>Of course, if you insist upon it, I will. But perhaps you’re not aware that there are usually
     from thirty to forty females of various ages and dimensions engaged in that establishment
     <emph>over the way</emph>, and I don’t think it would be exactly the safest place in the world
     for an unprotected male. Besides, I might be seen entering the premises, and then what would
     people say? Am I not known in the neighbourhood as the best of husbands? When
     <pb n="5"/> we go out don’t the people rush to their doors and windows to look at us? Oh,
     ’Stasy! ’Stasy! </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_F3">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p>Ha, ha, ha! My dear Marmaduke, you are certainly getting a little cracked on the subject.
    </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p>I know it. I’m so much cracked that I wonder I don’t fall to pieces. But I can’t help it.
     <stage>(placing his arm round her waist)</stage> </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M2">
    <speaker>Crum.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(without, l. d. f.)</stage> Oh, Mouser’s at home, is he? Particularly engaged, d’ye
     say? Pooh, pooh! I know better. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(aside)</stage> I shall do Crummy a terrific injury some of these days. I’m sure I
     shall. </p>
   </sp>
   <stage type="entrance"> Enter Crummy, L. D. F. </stage>
   <sp who="#L0118_M2">
    <speaker>Crum.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(advancing to Mouser, c., and giving him a slap on the back)</stage> Ah, Mouser, my
     boy—sure to find you at home, eh? Ha, ha! Always together, eh? Billing and cooing, and all that
     sort of thing, eh? <stage>(giving Mouser a poke in the side)</stage> By-the-bye, I’ve just come
     from Mrs. Major-General Jones. She would have nothing to say to me. She insists on seeing the
     head of the firm, so I told you’d be with her in a quarter of an hour. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(R.)</stage> Did you? Then you had better go back to Mrs. Jones, and tell her that I
     shan’t do anything of the sort. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M2">
    <speaker>Crum.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(C.)</stage> But you <emph>must</emph>. Her’s is a very important case. Neither more
     nor less than a separation from her husband, Major-General Jones. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p>I’ll have nothing to do with it. Major-General Jones has never offended me—what right, then,
     have I to stand between Major-General Jones and Mrs. Major-General Jones, and say to
     Major-General Jones, “Major-General Jones, take a last look at Mrs. Major-General Jones, for
     you’ll never set your eyes on Mrs. Major-General Jones again?” It’s absurd! </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M2">
    <speaker>Crum.</speaker>
    <p>But he ill-treats her—games, drinks, squanders her fortune—and, they do say, is not
     particular as to the number of his attachments. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(with a look of horror)</stage> ’Stasy, can such things be? <stage>(drags off his
     dressing gown, which he throws into Crummy’s face, who places it on back of chair, r. of
     table.)</stage> My coat—my hat—my blue bag—quick! <stage>(Crummy exits into office,
     r. d. f.)</stage> Oh, the monster! But I’ll hold him up to the execration of mankind. “Not
     particular as to the number of his attachments!” Gracious goodness! And to think that such a
     man is able to walk the streets without a policeman on each side of him. <stage>(Crummy returns
     with hat, coat, and blue bag)</stage> But, as I said before, I’ll expose him! <stage>(in his
     excitement he puts on the dressing gown again—puts on Crummy’s hat, and takes Crummy’s umbrella
     from table)</stage> I shan’t be long, my ’Stasia. I shall soon return on the wings of love——
     <stage>(going)</stage> </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_F3">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(l., detaining him)</stage> You’re surely not going out in your dressing gown? </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p>Eh? yes—it is my dressing gown, I declare. On second thoughts, I really don’t see why I
     should interfere between these Joneses. <stage>(places hat and umbrella on the table)</stage>
     I’d rather by half stop with you, my ’Stasy. </p>
   </sp>
   <pb n="6"/>
   <sp who="#L0118_M2">
    <speaker>Crum.</speaker>
    <p>Nonsense. You must go. Mrs. Major-General Jones expects you. <stage>(taking hold of one of

    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p>And why—why are you not afraid? Because, as you must have observed, you no sooner set your

   <sp who="#L0118_M1">
    <speaker>Mous.</speaker>
    <p>Yes, I heard her the other day. She was telling you to drop one, and then take up two. She
     didn’t say what, but I must say I was rather surprised at her requesting you to “turn over
     twice”—especially so soon after dinner. </p>

    <p>“Too attentive by half!” Then it is as I feared, and that simpleton, Mouser, doesn’t see that
     he is persecuting his wife with his affection. She evidently dreads a conjugal
     <emph>tête-à-tête</emph>, and no wonder. He never leaves her for a moment; but there he is,
     eternally and everlastingly at her side, “sighing like furnace,” and making himself ridiculous
     in her eyes. Mischief will certainly come of it. Some remedy must be devised. But what? If I
     could only contrive to excite Anastasia’s suspicions that her
     <pb n="7"/> husband, like Major-General Jones, is not exactly satisfied with one attachment at
     a time——By this means her jealousy might be roused. But she wouldn’t believe <emph>me</emph>.

    <p>Here, in an hour’s time. That’s what I came to tell you about. He left Mrs. Mouser’s veil at
     our place just now, and, when I opened it there was a letter inside! </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_M2">
    <speaker>Crum.</speaker>
    <p>A letter? </p>

    <p>Yes, sir. </p>

    <p>From Mr. Mouser? </p>

   <sp who="#L0118_F4">
    <speaker>Bet.</speaker>
    <p>No, sir, I defy anybody to say they ever saw me read anything. So I gave it to one of our

    <p>No, sir, Big Charlotte—a red-haired young woman, on a large scale. Perhaps you’ve noticed
     her, sir? </p>

    <p>Well, sir, she read the letter out loud, at the top of her voice, sir—and she’s a very

   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_F4">
    <speaker>Bet.</speaker>
    <p>Was known all over the laundry in a twinkling. Fancy thirty-seven female voices, including
     Big Charlotte’s, crying out, “Lawks!” at the same moment? Of course, I was obliged to clear
     myself, which I did, by telling them the whole business! How it was to oblige you, that I was
     trying to make Mr. Mouser fall in love with me; because as how you promised to give the little
     greengrocer’s shop at the corner of the street to the young woman that succeeded in captivating
     him. </p>

    <p>Well? </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0118_F4">
    <speaker>Bet.</speaker>
    <p>Well, sir—the words were no sooner out of my mouth, than all the washing-tubs were deserted
     in a moment, and the whole of the thirty-seven girls—Big Charlotte included—seemed determined
     to set about captivating Mr. Mouser at once—and, as ill-luck would have it, he passed by the
     window at that moment, sir—and they all instantly rushed out after him, in a body. </p>

   <p>The text of <emph>Betsy Barker!</emph> begins on page 302 of the scans. Other than differences
    in Lacy’s business address on the title page and information about the printer at the end, the
    text of the two scan sets appears to be the same. Because of issues related to publication, the
    condition of the scanned copies, and the scanning process itself, both sets were used for the
    transcription. </p>
   <p>The following changes were made to the text: </p>
