<p>Coming! Now then, be quiet, can't you? Drat the Exhibition, I say, and the
visitors too <stage>(yawning)</stage>. Keeping a poor girl running about the
whole blessed night. Missus makes them pay dear enough for their beds, they
might make use of them instead of sitting up till — <stage>(bell,
L.)</stage>Coming! That's the gent in the back attic, <stage>(bell,
R.)</stage>Now then, can't come to both of you at once, can I ? Why there's not
a hole or corner in the house that isn't let, and only one poor girl to do all
the work. I can't stand it much longer, <stage>(knocking at street
door)</stage>Go on, that's right There's the street door, now—well, they won't
catch me answering that at any rate, we've got enough people in the house
already without — <stage>(knocking louder)</stage>Will you be quiet ?
<stage>(bells ring R. and L.)</stage>Now, which am I to go to ? Well, the street
door's the nearest—here goes. Who's there ? <stage>(opens door in flat and then
the street door)</stage></p>
<stage>Enter Mr. Tippity with carpet bag, travelling case, umbrella, &amp;c.; he
is muffled in great coat and shawl. </stage>
<p>Oh! master, is it you ? I am so glad to see you home again. I thought you
were never — <stage>(bell, R.)</stage>Coming! <stage>(very loud)</stage></p>

<p>Don't, Clementina, don't raise your voice in that absurd way—here, help me
off with my coat.</p>

<speaker>Tip.</speaker>
<p>Why, what the deuce is all this bustle about. Oh, the lodgers I suppose. To
think of Mrs. Tippity's turning the house into a lodging house for the visitors
to the Exhibition—giving up a millinery business that brought her in £200 a year
too. But, as she says, no one thinks of trade in Exhibition time. Her letters
assure me she's making money like dirt. I do so long to see her. It's so nice to
get home again after the weary wanderings of a commercial traveller, in the lace
and trimming line, and after a long night's journey on the Great Western line,
to settle calmly down and enjoy the sweets of home with all its quiet —
<stage>(bells R. and L. ring very loud)</stage>Holloa! well, we'll leave out the
quiet, but to sit contentedly down, <stage>(sits in easy chair, L., table, and
jumps up directly and takes a boot from a chair with a spur)</stage>Oh, damn it,
we'll leave out the sitting down to. But to listen to the gentle voice we
love.</p>

<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>

sleep under the kitchen dresser, says have you such a thing as a corkscrew you
can lend him ?</p>

<sp who="#L0048_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>

coming!</p>
<stage>Exit Mrs. TIPP, R. </stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0048_M1">
<speaker>Tip.</speaker>
<p>It strikes me somewhat forcibly that the Grand Industrial Exhibition of all
Nations has not improved Mrs. Tippity's usually sweet temper. Well, I'll get out
of the way. I'm very sleepy <stage>(yawning)</stage>, so I'll go to bed.
<stage>(going, R.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Mrs. Tippity, R. 1 E. </stage>
<sp who="#L0048_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Pray, may I inquire where you are going to, Mr. Tippity?</p>

<p><stage>(horrified)</stage>To what, sir ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0048_M1">
<speaker>Tip.</speaker>
<p>Lor! only to think—how stupid of me—I quite forgot it, but now you mention
it, I <emph>should</emph> like a bit of supper after my journey. What have you
got in the house ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0048_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Supper, sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0048_M1">
<speaker>Tip.</speaker>
<p>Yes, just a little snack—cold fowl, a chop, or anything—I don't care.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0048_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>That I should live to see this day—a man I thought I could place implicit
faith in, asking for supper in Exhibition time!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0048_M1">
<speaker>Tip.</speaker>
<p>But, my sweet, now really—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0048_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Mr. Tippity ! Mr. Tippity ! and cold fowls selling at a guinea a piece,
and chops absolutely worth their weight in half-crowns.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0048_M1">
<speaker>Tip.</speaker>
<p>Good gracious! Is there a famine come to town ? or what has thus converted
our domestic poultry into <emph>guinea</emph>fowls ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0048_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>What? Isn't the Exhibition open ? Ain't we eaten out of house and home by
foreigners ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0048_M1">
<speaker>Tip.</speaker>
<p>Foreigners !—from <emph>Hungary</emph>, I should say.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0048_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Well, that's not bad for you, Tippy ; but wherever they come from, London
can't find victuals for them. There's that poor dear Mr. Cantelo, in
Leicester-square, has been hatching away by steam for the last fortnight, but
it's no use, you can't supply them.</p>
</sp>
<pb n="6"/>
<sp who="#L0048_M1">
<speaker>Tip.</speaker>
<p>Good gracious ! And yet there are political economists who say that the steam
power of England could supply the world. Well, it doesn't signify about supper.
I'll be off to bed. <stage>(going, r.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0048_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>And may I ask, where in the name of all that's extravagant you intend to
sleep ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0048_M1">
<speaker>Tip.</speaker>
<p>I presume, in the mahogany four post of my happier days. You shake your head.
Well then, in the humble turn-up in the attic of my bachelorhood—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0048_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>You really are the most provoking man in the world— didn't I write you word
that I've let our best bedroom to five ladies of quality, and fitted up a chest
of drawers for the babies?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0048_M1">
<speaker>Tip.</speaker>
<p>Lor! But the humble turn-up of my bachelorhood—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0048_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Contains at this moment the distinguished correspondent of the "Cannibal
Islands, Advertiser," three distressed Poles, and a Hungarian member of the
Peace Congress.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0048_M1">
<speaker>Tip.</speaker>
<p>Then where am I to sleep ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0048_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Where? Anywhere—or nowhere. Nobody sleeps in Exhibition time, except the
visitors.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0048_M1">

<p>Here, I'm wasting my time, while that poor young man from Quashee Bungo
<stage>(crossing l.)</stage>wants a pound's worth of soda water. Tippity if you
were a man you'd help your poor wife to wait on her lodgers instead of standing
there like a post. Let me tell you, sir, if you want to get up in the world—
<stage>(bell, l.)</stage>There's the attic. Exit,L</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0048_M1">
<speaker>Tip.</speaker>
<p>Help ! Yes, I will help. There's no help for it—no bed- no supper—no comfort.
Wait on my lodgers—make money— that's the plan. <stage>(takes napkin from

am ?—Give your orders, gents, the waiter's in the room ! <stage>(bell rings,
