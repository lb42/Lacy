     <p>To look after <emph>us</emph>, to look after <emph>you</emph>, you mean. His attention to

     <p>What a wretch I am. What a scoundrel I may say, and do myself no injustice. Here have I won
      the affections of a pure unsophisticated girl, Mary Fallows, and been asked twice in church;
      yet I, knowing there are actions for breaches of promise, and what a fiery dragon old Fallows
      is, I am deliberately about to fascinate yonder lovely creature. Regardless of the mess—</p>

     <p>Yes, the mess I shall get into. I have travelled every day from this station for a week. I
      have eaten all sorts of pastry, from hard biscuit to Bath-buns; drank all sorts of liquids,
      malt and spirituous, to obtain a look, a word from that gentle angel.</p>
