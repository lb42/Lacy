<head>Scene I. —The Fairies' haunt—A romantic scene, surrounded by bowers of
roses, in the midst of which rises a sparkling fountain. A broad lake in the
distance, shut in by mountains, which stretch to the horizon; the sun is just
seen rising over them. During the symphony numerous Sylphs and Fairies enter,
forming a dance around the fountain to the following chorus:—</head>

If ever there was charmed spot of Fairy haunt, this is one. The air is perfume;
fountains, sparkling with the rainbow's hue, leap from every rock; and, as my
willing steps advanced, a strain of melody sighed on my ear and drew me on to
follow. The ardour of the chace has robbed me of my companions. If they be not
too distant, this will call them to my side. </p>

a thin veil. As the Prince perceives the image, he starts back amazed R.

<l>When of a sudden—portentous wonder!— </l>
<l>From his shoulders, broad asunder, </l>

<l>And in the air—up he <hi>flew</hi>! </l>
<l>And a'top of a neighb'ring belfry </l>
<l>Fast he stuck before my view! </l>
<l>Then the <hi>Bells</hi> began a-sounding </l>

on his R.H., and Alidoro, Dandini, &amp;c., on foot upon his L.H., two young
Pages, richly dressed, stand on each side. Ladies and Gentlemen in profusion
fill up the scene: from time to <pb n="45"/> time during the Chorus various
visitors are pompously ushered in by the Baron (with his wand, as Master of the
Ceremonies) through the glass doors: they are courteously received by the

<stage>Clorinda, with a profusion of smiles, gives Pedro her hand, which he
receives with a profusion of bows, and they retire. Among the rest, Cinderella
and the Prince retake their seats. A general waltz now commences, which (after
it has sometime begun) the Prince prevails on Cinderella to join in. As they
gain the front of the stage, <pb n="50"/> and part in the figure, the clock over
the centre door suddenly becomes brightly illuminated, and strikes twelve!
Cinderella, preserving the motion of the dance, anxiously counts the hour, and
finding it's twelve, with an exclamation of fear, rushes through the dancers to
gain the door. The Prince (though not immediately), misses her, and by that time
she is seen in her old habiliments, serpenting through the ranks, till she
finally goes off by the centre doors. The Prince, impeded in his progress,
impatiently pursues her and disappears also.</stage>
<stage>During this time, Pedro, who seems to have forgotten all in the spirit of
the dance, has changed partners and is pompously setting to a superbly dressed
female in front of the stage, when suddenly his fine clothes fly up in the air,
and leave him in his old dress. The lady screams and indignantly retires,
leaving him dancing by himself. Some of the pages hastily advance, and forcibly
expel him out of the room. The dance, however, still continues, when the Prince
returns in much agitation, bearing in his hand one of Cinderella's glass
slippers.</stage>
