<head>REMARKS. </head>
<head>The Irishman in London.</head>
<p> It is amusing to contemplate the various singularities of men.<note place="foot">A physician once observed that he could tell of what country a man
was, by his <hi>complaint</hi>. If it laid in the <hi>head</hi>, he was a
<hi>Scotchman</hi>—if in the <hi>heart</hi>, he was an <hi>Irishman</hi>—if in
the <hi>stomach</hi>, he was an <hi>Englishman</hi></note> The Cockney, to whom
the <hi>V</hi> and the <hi>W</hi> are a source of as many perplexities as were
the <hi>two Dromios</hi> to the good people of Ephesus, has his patent for
cutting King George’s English most divertingly. The <hi>Welshman</hi> enjoys his
leek, his pedigree, and his toasted cheese. The <hi>Irishman</hi>, his brogue
and his bulls. There is no fun about a <hi>Scotchman</hi> ; unless (in the
absence of a post) when he is excited to dance to his national <hi>fiddle</hi>:
<hi>his</hi> peculiarities, though not pleasing, are nevertheless
profitable—for, like the mouse in the fable, he generally becomes too proud and
too pursy to creep in at the cranny from whence his leanness originally crept
out. These characteristics have not escaped the observation of dramatic writers;
and abundant mirth has been derived from their exhibition. The eccentricities of
<hi>Pat</hi>
<note place="foot">A gentleman, stepping into the Belfast mail, was asked by an
Irish waiter for something to drink, for the trouble of calling him. “To drink!”
exclaimed the gentleman—“ why, I gave <hi>Rooney</hi> a shilling.” “Och! bat,
plase your honour, I called <hi>him</hi> !” One Irishwoman, having fallen out
with another, was complaining to to a third how sadly she had been abused by an
<hi>Irishwoman</hi>. “And are you not an Irishwoman yourself?” exclaimed the
latter. “Och! and to be sure I am; bat I don’t come from <hi>them hot parts</hi>
that she does !” </note> have not been behindhand in contributing their full
share to the gayety of nations ; and, while we have laughed heartily at his
careless humour, his queer-sounding compound epithets, his antipodean
association of <hi>thunder</hi> and <hi>turf</hi>, and such-like comical
amalgamations of elementary and vegetable matter, some kind-hearted
<hi>trait</hi>, some dash of genuine feeling, has suddenly come across us, and
made us long to take him by the hand and claim acquaintance, <pb n="4"/> even
though we should receive the peculiar token with which St. Patrick is wont to
greet his particular friends— “From his sprig of shilelah and shamrock so green
!” </p>
<p> The farce of The Irishman in London is borrowed from “The Intriguing
Footman, or the Humours of Harry Humbug,” a piece attributed to James Whiteley,
formerly manager of the Nottingham and other provincial theatres, and acted at
Sheffield in 1791. It was originally produced at Covent Garden, at Mr.
Johnstone’s benefit; that admirable comedian taking the part of Murtoch Delany.
It has little plot, but is very ingeniously made up of incident and character.
It exhibits the various stratagems practised by Edward, an intriguing footman
(the Harry Humbug of the <hi>original</hi> farce), to deliver a letter from his
master, Captain Seymour, to Caroline, the daughter of one Mr. Frost, a
pertinacious old gentleman, who had taken a voyage from the West Indies to
London for the sole purpose of avoiding the importunities of the said captain,
and of marrying the young lady to Mr. Colloony, a simple native of the Emerald
Isle. The latter personage is accompanied, on his matrimonial trip, by his Irish
servant, Murtoch Delany. This is enlivened by the introduction of Cubba, a
faithful African, who falls in love with Murtoch, and in the simplicity of her
heart acquaints him with his good fortune; and of Cymon, who is almost as full
of quaint comparisons as Dean Swift’s celebrated song of <hi>Similes</hi>. There
is nothing comical about Mr. Frost, but his passion for Louisa; the young lady’s
return of his affection is, however, equally comical. The dialogue is pleasantly
written ; and, what with Edward’s rattling rhodomontade, Cymon’s pat and
provoking similes, and Murtoch Delany’s national whim, there is no want of
amusement in this farce. One of its chief attractions was the original
<hi>Planxty</hi>, which Johnstone sung in a manner that made every heart, Irish
and English, dance to its melody. </p>
<p> A first-rate actor of Irish characters is indispensable on a London stage.
We are not old enough to have seen Moody perform; but we remember him, many
years ago, a hale, respectable-looking old gentleman, taking his walks in
company with the veteran Boaden, the well- known performer of Robin Hood. Rock
(with many declensions) was of the Moody school—rigidly true to the brogue, but
occasionally heavy and listless. Webb <pb n="5"/> sings an Irish air with
admirable spirit; but he cannot act. The late Mr. Connor <hi>acted</hi> with
humour; but then (like the three unmusical rogues in good King Arthur's
days)<note place="foot"><l>«In good King Arthur’s days,</l><l> Oh, he was a very
good king !</l><l> Three sons of w * * * * were turn’d out of doors</l><l>
Because they <hi>couldn't sing !”</hi></l>
</note> he <hi>couldn't sing</hi>. Johnstone possessed both qualifications in
high perfection: his <hi>voice</hi> was full, clear, and melodious—his
<hi>acting</hi> rich, sparkling, and original. He was equally fine in genteel
comedy and in the broadest farce——in the finished gentleman and the veriest
Teague. His <hi>Major O'Flaherty</hi> was gallant and gay; his <hi>Foigard</hi>
<hi>(Kilkenny, by my soul!)</hi> was arch and pointed. In <hi>Looney</hi>, he
looked as if he had been born in a field, with a hay-fork in his hand. And how
he stood up for the honour of ould Ireland and her <hi>“manufactrys,”</hi> and
reiterated <hi>“bad travelling !”</hi> and <hi>“Oh! murther, murther !”</hi>
those who have seen his <hi>Murtoch Delany</hi> can amply testify. His pathos
was deep—his humour quick and sly; he had Pat’s hereditary fun and frisk—his
national naiveté and dancing hilarity. He could assume a-look of brisk
intelligence and of ineffable stupidity ; there was a peculiar archness in his
smile, and he had an <hi>Irish front</hi>. To follow <hi>such</hi> an actor is
no easy task; to fall short of him cannot be considered a failure. Mr. Power has
many of the qualifications that distinguished his predecessor: his brogue is
rich, his air smart and vivacious—the jokes come trippingly from his tongue,
lighted up with a leer whimsically illustrative of potatoes and whiskey. His
attempts have hitherto been confined to low comedy. His <hi>Irish Tutor</hi> is
good—so are his <hi>Loony</hi>, <hi>Murtoch</hi>, and <hi>Dennis
Bulgruddery</hi>. Mr. Power has a clear stage to himself; he has no competitor
in Irish characters. To him we apply Walsh's advice to <hi>Pope</hi>,—“study
<hi>correctness</hi>.” We have seen many a natural genius run to waste, for want
of attending to this necessary precaution. However excellent <hi>nature</hi> is
of herself, she may still derive improvement from <hi>art</hi>. </p>

Jamaica, happy place! which contains all that is dear to me on earth. Her cruel
father must have intercepted the letters I wrote from America, or she would have
contrived to let her Seymour know, she still retained the same tender affection
for him——Good heaven! is it possible? Ha! reason contradicts my sense of seeing,

happiness.</p>

<p> Why, sir, I met Cymon, pretended to him that I had left you in America, and
he told me they were all come; and that there was great doings preparing for an
elegant young fellow from Ireland, who was to marry Miss Caroline
immediately.</p>
</sp>

<p> By heavens! no such circumstance ever shall take place; and how to prevent

left rather abruptly—Now they'll renew their former mode of paying their
respects to me; and though I never return one visit, they'll still continue
their kind enquiries. If I had but a few pounds to satisfy those gentry, my mind
would be easy, my person free; and, thus disencumbered, I should most certainly
devise means to deliver from my master a letter to his dear Caroline, before she
consults her downy pillow this night.</p>

noble fellow—I wish he was a General, then his pocket might keep pace with his
heart. At present, the one is always a day's march behind the other. But how
shall I contrive to deliver my master's letter? No matter I'll trust to chance,

captivating, that I wish, from my heart, I may never leave it. Where is this

shoulder with his elbow on the t'other side—So, upon my sowl, sir, I was going
backward every step I went forward.—But at last, I saw a crowd staring up; so
myself axed dacently what was the matter—Stop, and luck up, says the man, and
you'll see: myself did so, and there was two black pictures of men, with
shillelys in their fists, thumping at one another, because the clock was
striking. When it had done, they had done, and I was done; for I found they
picked my pocket of the chick that I held fast in my hand, and every thing I had
in the world; and the hat off my head into the bargain!</p>

<stage>SONG.</stage>



<l>If you'd travel the wide world all over, </l>
<l>And sail across quite round the globe, </l>
<l>You must set out on horseback from Dover, </l>
<l>And sail unto sweet Balinrobe.</l>
<l> 'Tis there you'll see Ireland so famous, </l>
<l>That was built before Adam was breech'd, </l>
<l>Who lived in the reign of King Shamus, </l>
<l>Ere he was at Boyne over-reach'd.</l>

<stage>CHORUS.</stage>

<l> O, the Land of Shillelah for me.</l>

<l>There you'll see Ulster, and Munster, and Leinster, </l>
<l>Connaught, and sweet Kilkenny likewise, </l>
<l>That city where first, as a spinster, </l>
<l>I open'd these pair of black eyes; </l>
<l>In this town there is fire without smoking, </l>
<l>For a penny you'd buy fifty eggs, </l>
<l>And then there's such wit without joking, </l>
<l>And rabbits without any legs.</l>
<l>With my whack, &amp;c.</l>

<l>There you'll see my ancestors glorious,</l>
<l> The sons of the brave O's and Mac's, </l>
<l>Who died whene'er they were victorious, </l>
<l>And after that ne'er turn'd their backs. </l>
<l>Our heads are stout and full of valour, </l>
<l>Our hearts are wise and full of brains, </l>
<l>In love we ne'er blush nor change colour, </l>
<l>And the ladies reward all our pains.</l>
<l>With my whack, &amp;c.</l>

<l>Saint Patrick is still our protector, </l>
<l>He made us an island of saints, Drove out snakes and toads like an Hector, </l>
<l>And ne'er shut his eyes to complaints. </l>
<l>Then if you would live and be frisky, </l>
