<head>TO His Serene HIGHNESS <hi>George Augustus,</hi> Electoral Prince of HANOVER, Duke and Marquess of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Earl of <hi>Milford-Haven,</hi> Viscount <hi>North-Allerton,</hi> Baron of <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> and Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter.</head>

<p>
   THIS Dedication, which I always intended to Address to your <hi>HIGHNESS,</hi> and which
<pb facs="tcp:0058902000:4"/>
I was in hopes might have Congratulated you upon your being in <hi>England,</hi> must now wait for your Arrival. I am sure I speak the Sense of every honest <hi>Briton,</hi> when I say that we expect it with the utmost Impatience.</p>
<p>Your Highness, who has been hitherto a Stranger among us, cannot easily conceive the Confidence we repose in you; and it will, perhaps, hardly be believ'd in future Ages, that the first Report of the Duke
<pb facs="tcp:0058902000:5"/>
of <hi>Cambridge</hi>'s Design to Visit us, should raise the <hi>PUBLICK CREDIT</hi> of the <hi>British Nation.</hi>
</p>
<p>We are fill'd with Pleasure, to think that the most accomplish'd of <hi>Princes</hi> will perfect himself in the Arts of Government under the Eye, and Direction of the Greatest of <hi>Queens.</hi>
</p>
<p>If it is possible there shou'd be a Sett of Men among us who can wish to see their Country become a Province of <hi>France,</hi> it is, I think, pretty evident that
<pb facs="tcp:0058902000:6"/>
your Residence in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> will soon put an End to such Impious Expectations.</p>
<p>The Law of Nature makes it not improbable that you will one Day reign over us, and what may not our Posterity expect from a Prince who in his early Years distinguish'd himself in the Cause of Liberty, and led their Ancestors on to Victory? The Balance of <hi>Europe</hi> will doubtless be kept steady by that Hand which has already perform'd
<pb facs="tcp:0058902000:7"/>
such Wonders in order to maintain it; our Religion, our Laws, and Civil Rites can be in no Danger under a Prince, who from his Conversation with our Nobility, and his Presence at their most important Debates, will have a perfect Insight into all the Parts of our Constitution.</p>
<p>
   <hi>Britain</hi> shall from hence-forward claim your <hi>HIGHNESS</hi> intirely as her own, and endeavour by the most convincing Proofs of her Love and Respect, to make you
<pb facs="tcp:0058902000:8"/>
forget the Court of your Illustrious Father.</p>
<p>The Pains you have already taken to acquire our Tongue, cannot fail to endear you to every <hi>Englishman;</hi> yet as the Idioms of a Language are the last Things we arrive at, I am in hopes an <hi>English</hi> Comedy will not be thought the most improper Present that could be offer'd to your <hi>HIGHNESS.</hi>
</p>
<p>There is no doubt but you will soon be made the Subject of more Correct Pens, and receive a just Tribute
<pb facs="tcp:0058902000:9"/>
from the greatest Authors of our Nation: In the mean Time, tho' I am, perhaps, the most unworthy, I have at least one Advantage, that I am the first who have shewn my Respect in this Manner, and sued for your Protection.</p>

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>I Don't pretend to write a Preface, either to point out the Beauties, or to excuse the Errors, a judicious Reader may possibly discover in the following Scenes, but to give those excellent Comedians their Due, to whom, in some Measure the best Dramatick Writers are oblig'd. The Poet and the Player are like Soul and Body, indispensibly necessary to one another; the correct Author makes the Player shine, whilst the judicious Player makes the Poet's Fame immortal. I freely acknowledge my self oblig'd to the Actors in general, and to Mr. <hi>Wilks,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Oldfield</hi> in particular; and I owe them this Justice to say, That their inimitable Action cou'd only support a Play at such a Season, and among so many Benefits. Let this encourage our <hi>English</hi> Bards to Write, furnish but the artful Player with Materials, and his Skill will lay the Foundation for your Fame.</p>
<p>I must again repeat that which I meet with every where, I mean the just Admiration of the Performance of Mr. <hi>Wilks,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Oldfield,</hi> and own that they much out-did in Action the strongest of my Conceptions; for tho' Nature was my Aim in the last Act of this Comedy, yet Nature herself were she to paint a Love Quarrel, wou'd only Copy them.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<head type="sub">
   <hi rend="stage">Spoken by <hi>Mr.</hi> MILLS.</hi>
</head>
<l>OUR <hi>Author</hi> fears the Criticks of the Stage,</l>
<l>Who like Barbarians, spare nor Sex, nor Age;</l>
<l>She trembles at those Censors in the Pit,</l>
<l>Who think good Nature shows a want of Wit:</l>
<l>Such Malice, Oh, what Muse can undergo it?</l>
<l>To save themselves, they always Damn the Poet.</l>
<l>Our Author flies from such a Partial Jury,</l>
<l>As wary Lovers from the Nymphs of <hi>Drury:</hi>
</l>
<l>To the few Candid Judges for a Smile,</l>
<l>She humbly sues to Recompence her Toil.</l>
<l>To the bright Circle of the Fair, she next,</l>
<l>Commits her Cause, with Anxious Doubts perplext.</l>
<l>Where can she with such hopes of Favour kneel,</l>
<l>As to those Judges, who her Frailties feel?</l>
<l>A few Mistakes, her Sex may well excuse,</l>
<l>And such a Plea, No <hi>Woman</hi> shou'd refuse:</l>
<l>If she succeeds, a <hi>Woman</hi> gains Applause,</l>
<l>What <hi>Female</hi> but must favour such a Cause.</l>
<l>Her Faults,—If such there be:—Then,—pass 'em by,</l>
<l>And only on her Beauties fix your Eye.</l>
<l>In Plays, like Vessels floating on the Sea,</l>
<l>There's none so Wise to know their Destiny.</l>
<l>In this, howe'er the Pilot's Skill appears,</l>
<l>While by the Stars his constant Course he steers;</l>
<l>In this our <hi>Author</hi> does her Judgment shew,</l>
<l>That for her Safety she relies on You.</l>
<l>Your Approbation Fair ones, can't but move,</l>
<l>Those stubborn Hearts, which first you taught to Love:</l>
<l>The Men must all Applaud this Play of ours,</l>
<l>For who dares See with other Eyes, than Yours?</l>

   <p>Not since he went; I forbade him writing till the public news gave him an

<sp>
   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>Your caution was good my Lord.

      <p>There is no Condition of Life without its Cares, and it is the Perfection of a Man to wear 'em as easie as he can; this unfortunate Duel of my Son's does not pass without Impression. But since 'tis past Prevention, all my Concern is now, how he may escape the Punishment; -->If

      show it only to the Laity to create Desires, and inflame Accompts, that they
      may purchase Pardons at a dearer Rate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>I own Wenching is something more difficult here than in <hi>England,</hi> where
      Womens Liberties are subservient to their Inclinations, and Husbands seem of no
      Effect but to take Care of the Children which their Wives provide.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>And does Restraint get the better of Inclination with your Women here? No, I'll
      be sworn not even in fourscore. Don't I know the Constitution of the
         <hi>Spanish</hi> Ladies?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>And of all Ladies where you come, Colonel, you were ever a Man of
      Gallantry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>Ah <hi>Frederick,</hi> the <hi>Kirk</hi> half starves us <hi>Scotchmen.</hi> We
      are kept so sharp at home, that we feed like Cannibals abroad. Hark ye, hast
      thou never a pretty Acquaintance now, that thou wouldst consign over to a
      Friend for half an Hour, ha?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>Faith Colonel, I am the worst Pimp in <hi>Christendom,</hi> you had better
      trust to your own Luck, the Women will soon find you out I warrant you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>Ay, but it is dangerous forraging in an Enemy's Country, and since I have some
      hopes of seeing <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0058902000:19"/> my own again, I had rather
      purchase my Pleasure, than run the hazard of a <hi>Stilletto</hi> in my Guts.
      'Egad, I think I must e'en Marry and Sacrifice my Body for the good of my Soul,
      wilt thou recommend me to a Wife then, one that is willing to exchange her
         <hi>Moyders</hi> for <hi>English</hi> Liberty; ha Friend,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>She must be very handsome I suppose.</p>
</sp>

   <p>The handsomer the better—but be sure she has a Nose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>Ay, ay, and some Gold.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

   <p>Oh, very much Gold, I shall never be able to swallow the Matrimonial Pill, if
      it be not well Gilded.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>Puh, Beauty will make it slide down nimbly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>At first perhaps it may, but the Second or Third Dose will choak me—I confess
         <hi>Frederick,</hi> Women are the prettiest Play-things in Nature, but Gold,
      substantial Gold, gives 'em the Air, the Mien, the Shape, the Grace, and Beauty
      of a Goddess.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>And has not Gold the same Divinity in their Eyes Colonel?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>Too often.—Money is the very God of Marriage, the Poets dress him in a Saffron
      Robe, by which they Figure out the golden Deity, and his lighted Torch blazons
      those mighty Charms, which encourage us to List under his Banner.</p>
   <l>
      <hi>None marry now for Love, no, that's a Jest,</hi>

   <p>For goodness sake, Madam, where are you going in this Pet?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Isab.</speaker>
   <p>Any where to avoid Matrimony; the thoughts of a Husband is as terrible to me as
      the sight of a Hobgoblin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Inis.</speaker>
   <p>Ay, of an old Husband, but if you might chuse for your self, I fancy Matrimony
      wou'd be no such frightful Thing to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Isab.</speaker>
   <p>You are pretty much in the right, <hi>Inis</hi>; but to be forc'd into the Arms
      of an Ideot, a sneaking, snivling, drivling, avaricious Fool, who has neither
      Person to please the Eye, Sense to charm the Ear, nor generosity to supply
      those Defects, ah <hi>Inis!</hi> What pleasant Lives Women lead in
         <hi>England,</hi> where Duty wears no Fetter but Inclination: The Custom of
      our Country inslaves us from our very Cradles, first to our Parents, next to
      our Husbands; and when Heaven is so kind to rid us of both these, our Brothers
      still usurp Authority, and expect a blind Obedience from us, so that Maids,
      Wives, or Widows, we are little better than Slaves to the Tyrant Man, therefore
      to avoid their Power, I resolve to cast my self into a Monastery.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Inis.</speaker>
   <p>That is, you'll cut your own Throat to avoid another's doing it for you. Ah
      Madam, those Eyes tell me you have no Nuns flesh about you; a Monastery quotha!
      Where you'll wish your self in the Green-Sickness in a Month.</p>
</sp>

</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Isab.</speaker>
   <p>Why what wou'd your Wisdom do if you were?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Inis.</speaker>
   <p>I'de imbark with the first fair Wind with all my Jewels, and seek my Fortune on
      t'other side the Water; no Shoar can treat you worse than your own; there's
      ne'er a Father in <hi>Christendom</hi> should make me marry any Man against my
      Will.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Isab.</speaker>

   <p>Here's an old Dog for you.</p>

   <p>Do not mistake, Sir, the fatal Stroak which separates Soul and Body, is not

   <p>Balls, Madam! Odslife, I ask your Pardon Madam! I, I, I, had mislaid some
      Wash-Balls of my Master's t'other Day; and because I cou'd not think where I
      had laid them, just when he ask'd for them, he very fairly broke my Head,
      Madam, and now it seems I can think of nothing else. Alas! He Dance Madam! No,
      no, poor Gentleman, he is as Melancholy as an unbrac'd Drum.</p>

   <speaker>Isab.</speaker>
   <p>Thou art no Stranger to one part of it; I have often told thee that my Father
      design'd to sacrifice me to the Arms of <hi>Don Guzman,</hi> who it seems is
      just return'd from <hi>Holland,</hi> and expected ashore to-morrow, the Day
      that he has set to celebrate our Nuptials, upon my refusing to obey him, he
      lock'd me into my Chamber, vowing to keep me there till he arriv'd, and force
      me to consent. I know my Father to be possitive, never to be won from his
      Design; and having no hope left me, to escape the Marriage, I leap'd from the
      Window, into the Street.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>You have not hurt your self I hope.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Isab.</speaker>
   <p>No, a Gentleman passing by, by Accident caught me in his Arms; at first my
      Fright made me apprehend it was my Father, till he assur'd me to the
      contrary.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Flor.</speaker>
   <p>He is a very fine Gentleman I promise you, Madam, and a well bred Man I warrant
      him. I think I never saw a Grandee put his Hand into his Pocket with a better
      Air in my whole Life Time; then he open'd his Purse with such a Grace, that
      nothing but his Manner of presenting me the Gold cou'd equal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>There is but one common Road to the Heart of a Servant, and 'tis impossible for
      a generous Person to mistake it.—But how came you hither <hi>Isabella?</hi>
   </p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Isab.</speaker>
   <p>I know not, I desir'd the Stranger to convey me to the next <hi>Monastery,</hi>
      but e'er I reach'd thy Door, I saw, or fancy'd that I saw, <hi>Lissardo,</hi>
      my Brother's Man, and the Thought that his Master might not be far off, flung
      me into a Swoon, which is all that I remember: Ha! What's here
<stage>(<hi>takes up a Letter</hi>)</stage>

   <p>Death, not you? Is there another of your Name in the House? But, come on,
      convince me of the Truth of what you say: Open the Window, if his Business does
      not lye with you, your Conversation may be heard—This, and only this, can take
      of my Suspicion—What do you pause! Oh Guilt! Guilt! Have I caught you, Nay then

      into his Apartment, What shall I do if he enters? There he finds his Sister—If
      he goes out he'll quarrel with the Stranger—Nay do not struggle to be gone my
         <hi>Felix</hi>—If I open the Window he may discover the whole Intrigue, and
      yet of all Evils we ought to chuse the least. Your Curiosity shall be
      satisfied. Whoe'er you are that with such Insolence dare use my Name, and give

      the Occasion that rid me of your Visits and gave me Freedom to enjoy the Choice
      which you think I have made; have I any Interest in thee but my Love? Or am I
      bound by aught but Inclination to submit and follow thee—No Law whilst single

      him off Madam, for she did, and she did not come as, as, as, as a, a a Man may

<sp>
   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>

<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>Insolent! Nay, if instead of owning your Fault you endeavour to insult my
      Patience, I must tell you Sir, you don't behave your self like that Man of
      Honour you wou'd be taken for, you ground your Quarrel with me upon your own
      Inconstancy; 'tis plain you are false your self, and wou'd make me the
      Agressor—It was not for nothing the Fellow oppos'd my Entrance—This last Usage
      has given me back my <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0058902000:52"/> Liberty, and now my

      must know Sir, we have had a sneaking Kindness for one another a great
      while—She was not willing you should know it, so when she heard your Voice, she
      ran into the Cloaths Press, I wou'd have told you this at first, but I was
      afraid of her Lady's knowing it, this is the Truth as I hope for a whole Skin,
      Sir.</p>
</sp>

      Father shou'd find a Stranger here, it might make him hurry me into a
         <hi>Monastery</hi> immediately; I can't for my Life admire your Conduct, to
      encourage a Person altogether unknown to you.—'Twas very Imprudent to meet him
      this Morning, but much more so, to send for him hither, knowing what
      Inconveniency you have already drawn upon me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Isab.</speaker>
   <p>I am not insensible how far my Misfortunes have embarrrast you; and if you
      please, sacrifice my Quiet to your own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>Unkindly urg'd—Have I not preferr'd your Happiness to every Thing that's dear
      to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Isab.</speaker>
   <p>I know thou hast—Then do not deny me this last Request, which in a few Hours
      perhaps, may render <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0058902000:60"/> my Condition, able to
      clear thy Fame, and bring my Brother to thy Feet for Pardon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>I wish you don't repent of this Intrigue. I suppose he knows you are the same
      Woman that he brought in here last Night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Isab.</speaker>
   <p>Not a Syllable of that, I met him vail'd, and to prevent his knowing the House,
      I order'd Mrs. <hi>Flora</hi> to bring him by the back Door into the
      Garden.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>The very Way which <hi>Felix</hi> comes, If they should meet, there would be

</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Isab.</speaker>
   <p>'Tis too late to dispute that now, dear <hi>Violante,</hi> I acknowledge the

<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>That is indeed a weighty Consideration, well, what am I to do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

   <p>Very well—This is a very fruitful Soil, I have not been here quite four and

   <p>Nay, nay, hold Colonel, my Bed-Chamber is not to be enter'd without a certain

</sp>
<sp>

   <p>Purchase! Humph, This is some kept Mistress, I suppose; who industriously lets
      out her leisure Hours. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>)</stage> Look ye, Madam, you
      must consider we Soldiers are not over stock'd with Money.—But we make ample

</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>Nay, don't give your self the trouble of drawing your Purse Colonel, my Design
      is level'd at your Person, if that be at your own disposal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>Ay, that it is Faith Madam, and I'll settle it as firmly upon thee.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>As Law can do it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>Hang Law in love Affairs, thou shalt have Right and Title to it out of pure
      Inclination.—A Matrimonial Hint again! Gad, I fancy the Women have a Project on
      foot to transplant the Union into <hi>Portugal.</hi>
   </p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>Then you have an aversion to Matrimony, Colonel; did you never see a Woman, in
      all your Travels, that you cou'd like for a Wife?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>A very odd Question.—Do you really expect that I shou'd speak Truth now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>I do, if you expect to be so dealt with, Colonel.</p>
</sp>

   <p>Is she in your own Country, or this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

   <p>This is a very pretty kind of a Catechism; but I don't conceive which way it

   <p>Oh, Colonel, I am not the happy Woman, nor do I wish it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

   <p>No, I'm sorry for that.—What the Devil does she mean by all these

<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>Come Colonel, for once be Sincere.—Perhaps you may not repent it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>Faith Madam, I have an Inclination to Sincerity, but I'm afraid you'll call my
      Manners in Question: This is like to be but a silly Adventure, here's so much
      Sincerity required. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>
      </stage>
   </p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>Not at all; I prefer Truth before Compliment in this Affair.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>Why then to be plain with you, Madam, a Lady last Night wounded my Heart by a
      Fall from a Window, whose Person I cou'd be contented to take, as my Father
      took my Mother, till Death us doth part:—But who she is, or how distinguish'd,
      whether Maid, Wife, or Widow I can't inform you, perhaps you are she.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>Not to keep you in suspence, I am not She, but I can give you an Account of
      Her; that Lady is a Maid of Condition, has ten Thousand Pounds; and if you are
      a single Man, her Person, and Fortune are at your Service.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>I accept the Offer with the highest Transports; but say my charming Angel, art

   <p>No, no, no, he comes that way, how shall I prevent their Meeting? Here, here,

   <p>Can I do otherways, when you have the Assurance to approach me, after what I

</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>Assurance, rather call it good Nature, after what I heard last Night; but such
      regard to Honour, have I in my Love to you, I cannot bear to be suspected, nor
      suffer you to entertain false Notions of my Truth, without endeavouring to
      convince you of my Innocence, so much good Nature have I more than you

   <p>'Tis harder to Pardon an Injury done to what we love than to our selves, but at

   <p>What need of Repetition from my Tongue, when every Look confesses what you

</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>Oh! Let no Man judge of Love but those who feel it, what wondrous Magick lies
      in one kind Look.—One tender Word destroys a Lover's Rage, and melts his
      fiercest Passion into soft Complaint. Oh the Window, <hi>Violante,</hi> woud'st
      thou but clear that one Suspicion!</p>

   <p>Well said <hi>Violante.</hi>—I am glad to find her so willing to leave the
      World, but it is wholly owing to my Prudent Management; did she know that she
      might command her Fortune when she came at Age, or upon Day of Marriage,
      Perhaps she'd change her Note.—But I have always told her that her Grand-Father
      left it with this Proviso, That she turn'd <hi>Nun,</hi> now a small Part of
      this twenty Thousand Pounds provides for her in the <hi>Nunnery,</hi> and the
      rest is my own; there is nothing to be got in this Life without Policy.
<stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>)</stage> Well Child, I am going into the Country

   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>Will you never cease to Impose upon me?</p>

<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>You impose upon your self, my Dear, do you think I did not see you? Yes, I did,
      and resolv'd to put this Trick upon you; I knew you'd take the Hint, and soon
      relapse into your wonted Error: how easily your Jealousy is fir'd, I shall have
      a blessed Life with you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>Was there nothing in it then, but only to try me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>Won't you believe your Eyes?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>No, because I find they have deceiv'd me; well, I am convinc'd that Faith is as
      necessary in Love as in Religion; for the Moment a Man lets a Woman know her
      Conquest, he resigns his Senses, and sees nothing but what she'd have him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>And as soon as that Man finds his Love return'd, she becomes as errant a Slave,
      as if she had already said after the Priest.</p>

   <p>The Priest, <hi>Violante,</hi> wou'd dissipate those Fears which cause these

   <p>A <hi>Scots</hi> Footman, that belongs to Colonel <hi>Britton,</hi> an

   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>Yes, why do you ask me?</p>

   <p>Nay no great Matter, but my Man tells me that he has had some little Difference

   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>He is a good harmless innocent Fellow, I am <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0058902000:75"
      /> sorry for it; the Colonel lodges in my House, I knew him formerly in
         <hi>England,</hi> and met him here by Accident last Night, and gave him an
      Invitation home, he is a Gentleman of a good Estate, besides his Commission; of
      excellent Principles, and strict Honour I assure you.</p>

<sp>

   <p>There's no Danger of a fine Gentleman's being lost in this Town, Sir.</p>

<sp>
   <speaker>Col,</speaker>
   <p>That Compliment don't belong to me Sir. But I assure you I have been very near

</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>Who attempted it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>Faith I know her not—Only that she is a charming Woman, I mean as much as I saw

   <p>My Heart swells with Apprehension.—Some accidental Rencounter.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>A Tavern I suppose adjusted the Matter.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>A Tavern! No, no Sir, she is above that Rank I assure you, this Nymph sleeps in
      a Velvet Bed, and Lodgings every Way agreeable.</p>

<sp>
   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>Ha, a Velvet Bed!—I thought you said but now Sir, you knew her not.</p>

<sp>
   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>Ay, ay, come, come, unfold.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>Why then you must know Gentleman, that I was convey'd to her Lodgings, by one
      of Cupids Emissaries, call'd a Chambermaid, in a Chair, thro' fifty blind
      Alleys, who by the help of a Key let me into a Garden.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0058902000:76"/>

   <p>S'Death, a Garden, this must be <hi>Violante</hi>'s Garden.

      </stage>
   </p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>From thence conducted me into a spacious Room, then dropt me a Courtesie, told
      me her Lady would wait on me presently, so without unvailing modestly
      withdrew.</p>

   <p>Well, how then Colonel?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>Then Sir, immediately from another Door issued forth a Lady, arm'd at both
      Eyes, from whence such Showers of Darts fell round me, that had I not been
      cover'd with the Shield of another Beauty, I had infallibly fall'n a Martyr to
      her Charms; for you must know I just saw her Eyes, Eyes did I say? No, no,
      hold, I saw but one Eye, tho' I suppose it had a Fellow, equally as
      killing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>But how came you to see her Bed Sir? S'Death this Expectation gives a thousand
      Racks. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>
      </stage>
   </p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>Why upon her Maid's giving Notice her Father was coming she thrust me into the
      Bed-Chamber.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>Upon her Father's coming?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>Ay, so she said, but putting my Ear to the Keyhole of the Door, I found it was
      another Lover.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>Confound the Jilt! 'Twas she without dispute. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>
      </stage>
   </p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>Ah poor Colonel, ha, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>I discover'd they had had a Quarrel, but whether they were reconcil'd or not, I
      can't tell, for the second Alarm brought the Father in good earnest, and had
      like to have made the Gentleman and I acquainted, but she found some other
      Stratagem to convey him out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>Contagion seize her, and make her Body ugly as her Soul. There's nothing left
      to doubt of now,—'Tis plain 'twas she,—Sure he knows me, and takes this Method
      to insult me, S'Death I cannot bear it. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>
      </stage>
   </p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>So when she had dispatch'd her old Lover, she <pb n="63"
         facs="tcp:0058902000:77"/> paid you a Visit in her Bed-Chamber, ha,
      Colonel?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>No, Pox take the impertinent Puppy, he spoil'd my Diversion, I saw her no
      more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>Very fine! Give me Patience Heaven, or I shall burst with Rage.
<stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>
      </stage>
   </p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>That was hard.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>Nay, what was worse, the Nymph that introduc'd me convey'd me out again over
      the Top of a high Wall, where I ran the Danger of having my Neck broke, for the
      Father it seems had lock'd the Door by which I enter'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>That Way I miss'd him:—Damn her Invention. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>)</stage>
      Pray Colonel was this the same Lady you met upon the <hi>Terrerio de passa</hi>
      this Morning?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

   <p>Faith I can't tell Sir, I had a Design to know who that Lady was, but my Dog of
      a Footman, whom I had order'd to watch her home, fell fast a Sleep—I gave him a
      good beating for his Neglect, and I have never seen the Rascal since.</p>

   <p>Sir I have a Right to every Thing that relates to <hi>Violante</hi>—And he that

</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>Look ye Sir, that I dare draw my Sword I think will admit of no Dispute.—But
      tho' fighting's my Trade, I'm not in Love with it, and think it more honourable
      to decline this Business, than pursue it. This may be a Mistake, however I'll
      give you my <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0058902000:79"/> Honour never to have any
      Affair directly, or indirectly with <hi>Violante</hi> provided she is your
         <hi>Violante</hi>; but if there shou'd happen to be another of her Name I
      hope you wou'd not engross all the <hi>Violantes</hi> in the Kingdom.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

   <p> 〈◊〉 Quarrels spring up like Mushrooms, in a Minute: <hi>Violante,</hi> and he,
      was but just reconcil'd, and you have furnish'd him with fresh Matter for
      falling out again, and I am certain Colonel, <hi>Gibby</hi> is in the

   <p>I am sorry for what I have said, for the Lady's Sake, but who could divine,
      that she was his Mistress, prithy who is this warm Spark?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>He is the Son of one of our Grandees, nam'd <hi>Don Lopez de Pementell,</hi> a
      very honest Gentleman, but something passionate in what relates to his Love.—He
         <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0058902000:80"/> is an only Son, which perhaps may be
      one Reason for indulging his Passion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>When Parents have but one Child, they either make a Madman, or a Fool of
      him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>He is not the only Child, he has a Sister, but I think thro' the Severity of
      his Father, who would have married her against her Inclination, she has made
      her escape, and notwithstanding he has offer'd five hundred Pounds, he can get
      no Tydings of her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>Ha! How long has she been missing?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>Nay, but since last Night, it seems.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>Last Night! The very Time! How went she?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>No body can tell, they conjecture thro' the Window.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Col.</speaker>
   <p>I'm transported! This must be the Lady I caught; What sort of a Woman is
      she?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
   <p>Middle siz'd, a lovely brown, a fine pouting Lip, Eyes that roul and languish,
      and seem to speak the exquisite Pleasure that her Arms could give!</p>

   <p>I have a natural Tendency in me to the Flesh, thou know'st, and who can hear of

<sp>

   <p>If I were in your Place, <hi>Felix,</hi> I'd chuse to stay at home, when these

   <stage>(<hi>Here he affects to be careless of her.</hi>

<sp>

   <p>I am very sensible Madam of what you mean: I disturb you no doubt, but were I
      in a better Humour I shou'd not incommode you less. I am but too well
      convinc'd, that you could easily dispence with my Visit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>When you behave your self as you ought to do no Company so welcome—But when you
      reserve me for your ill Nature, I wave your Merit, and consider <pb n="68"
         facs="tcp:0058902000:82"/> what's due to my self—And I must be so free to
      tell you <hi>Felix,</hi> that these Humors of yours will abate, if not
      absolutely destroy the very Principles of Love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>
      <stage>(<hi>Rising</hi>)</stage> And I must be so free to tell you Madam, that
      since you have made such ill Returns to the Respect that I have paid you, all
      you do shall be indifferent to me for the Future, and you shall find me abandon
      your Empire with so little Difficulty, that I'll convince the World your Chains
      are not so hard to break as your Vanity would tempt you to believe—I cannot
      brook the Provocations you give.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>This is not to be born—Insolent! You abandon! You! Whom I have so often forbad
      ever to see me more! Have you not fall'n at my Feet? Implor'd my Favour and
      Forgiveness—Did you not trembling wait, and wish, and sigh, and swear your self
      into my Heart? Ingrateful Man! If my Chains are so easily broke as you pretend,
      then you are the silliest Coxcomb living, you did not break 'em long ago; and I
      must think him capable of brooking any thing on whom such Usage could make no

<sp>
   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>I always believed, Madam, my Weakness was the greatest Addition to your Power,
      you would be less Imperious, had my Inclination been less forward to oblige
      you.—You have indeed forbad me your Sight, but your Vanity even then assured
      you I would return, and I was Fool enough to feed your Pride.—Your Eyes, with
      all their boasted Charms, have acquired the greatest Glory in conquering
      me.—And the brightest Passage of your Life is, wounding this Heart with such
      Arms as pierce but few Persons of my Rank.</p>
   <stage>(<hi>Walks about in a great Pet.</hi>)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>Matchless Arrogance! True Sir, I should have kept Measures better with you, if
      the Conquest had been worth preserving, but we easily hazard what <pb n="69"
         facs="tcp:0058902000:83"/> gives us no Pain to loose.—As for my Eyes, you
      are mistaken if you think they have vanquished none but you; there are Men
      above your boasted Rank who have confess'd their Power, when their Misfortune
      in pleasing you made them obtain such a disgraceful Victory.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>Yes Madam, I am no Stranger to your Victories.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>And what you call the brightest Passage of my Life, is not the least glorious
      Part of yours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>Ha, ha, don't put your self into a Passion, Madam, for I assure you after this
      Day I shall give you no Trouble.—You may meet your Sparks on the <hi>Terriero
         de Passa</hi> at Four in the Morning, without the least Regard of mine.—For
      when I quit your Chamber, the World shan't bring me back.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>I am so well pleas'd with your Resolution, I don't care how soon you take your
      leave.—But what you mean by the <hi>Terreiro de passa</hi> at Four in the
      Morning I can't guess.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>No, no, no, not you.—You was not upon the <hi>Terriero de passa</hi> at Four
      this Morning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>No, I was not; but if I was, I hope I may Walk where I please, and at what Hour
      I please without asking you leave.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>Oh, doubtless Madam! And you might meet Colonel <hi>Britton</hi> there, and
      afterwards send your Emissary to fetch him to your House.—And upon your
      Father's coming in, thrust him into your Bed-Chamber—without asking my leave.
      'Tis no Business of mine if you are exposed among all the Foot-Men in
      Town.—Nay, if they Ballad you, and cry you about at a half-Penny a piece.—They
      may without my Leave.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>Audacious! Don't provoke me—Don't; my Reputation is not to be sported with
<stage>(<hi>Going up to him.</hi>)</stage> at this rate.—No Sir, it is
      not. <stage>(<hi>bursts into Tears.</hi>)</stage> Inhuman <hi>Felix</hi>!—Oh
         <hi>Isabella,</hi> what a Train of Ills hast thou brought on me?</p>

   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>Ha! I cannot bear to see her Weep.—A Woman's <pb n="70"
         facs="tcp:0058902000:84"/> Tears are far more Fatal than our Swords.
<stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>)</stage> Oh <hi>Violante.</hi>—S'Death! What a
      Dog am I? Now have I no Power to stir:—Dost not thou know such a Person as
      Colonel <hi>Britton?</hi> Prithy tell me, did'st not thou meet him at Four this
      Morning upon the <hi>Terreiro de passa</hi>?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>Were it not to clear my Fame, I would not answer thee thou black Ingrate!—But I
      cannot bear to be reproach'd with what I even Blush to think of, much less to
      act; by Heaven I have not seen the <hi>Terreiro de passa</hi> this Day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>Did not a <hi>Scots</hi> Foot-Man attack you in the Street neither
         <hi>Violante?</hi>
   </p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>Yes, but he mistook me for another, or he was Drunk, I know not which.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
   <p>And do not you know this <hi>Scots</hi> Colonel?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
   <p>Pray ask me no more Questions, this Night shall clear my Reputation, and leave
      you without Excuse for your base Suspicions; more than this I shall not
      satisfie you, therefore Pray leave me.</p>

   <p>Didst thou ever love me, <hi>Violante?</hi>

      but in the Surprize having left open the Door, this very Person whom You see,
      with his drawn Sword ran in; protesting, if I refused to give her up to his
