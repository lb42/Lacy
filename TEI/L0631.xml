    <head>PREFACE.</head>
    <p>This Drama is in no sense a <hi>translation</hi>, and ought not, I think, in fairness to be
     called even an <hi>adaptation</hi> of Victor Hugo's fine play <hi>"Le Roi s'Amuse."</hi></p>
    <p>It originated in a request made to me by one of our most popular actors, to turn the libretto
     of Rigoletto into a play, as he wished to act the part of the jester. On looking at Victor
     Hugo's drama, with this object, I found so much in it that seemed to me inadmissible on our
     stage—so much, besides, that was wanting in dramatic motive and cohesion, and,—I say it in all
     humility—so much that was defective in that central secret of stage effect, climax, that I
     determined to take the situation of the jester and his daughter, and to recast in my own way
     the incidents in which their story was invested.</p>
    <p>The death of Galeotto Manfredi at the hands of his wife Francesca Bentivoglio is historical.
     It seemed to me that the atmosphere of a petty Italian Court of the Fifteenth Century was well
     suited, as a medium for presenting the jester's wrongs, his rooted purpose of revenge, and the
     miscarriage of that purpose.</p>
    <p>I should not have thought it necessary to say thus much, had not some of the newspaper
     critics talked of my work as a simple translation of Victor Hugo's drama, while others
     <pb n="3"/> described it, more contemptuously, as a mere <hi>rifaciamento</hi> of Verdi's
     libretto.</p>
    <p>Those who will take the trouble to compare my work with either of its alleged originals, will
     see that my play is neither translation nor <hi>rifaciamento.</hi></p>
    <p>The motives of Bertuccio, the machinery by which his revenge is diverted from its intended
     channel, and the action in the court subsequent to the carrying off of his daughter, are my
     own, and I conceive that these features give me the fullest right to call the "Fool's Revenge"
     a <hi>new</hi> play, even if the use of Victor Hugo's <hi>Triboulet and Blanche</hi> disentitle
     it to the epithet "<hi>original</hi>"—which is matter of opinion.</p>
    <p>For the admirable manner in which the drama is mounted and represented at Sadler's Wells, and
     for the peculiarly powerful impersonation of Bertuccio, I owe all gratitude to Mr. Phelps. I
     must extend that feeling also to Miss Heath, Miss Atkinson, and the rest of the Sadler's Wells
     Company engaged in the representation of the "Fool's Revenge."</p>

   <div type="costume">
    <head>Costumes.</head>
    <p>At <hi>Sadler's Wells</hi> the costume and scenery of this play were appropriate to the
     period of Francis the First, which is some years later than the actual date of Manfredi's
     murder. This departure from strict chronology is unobjectionable, when, as at <hi>Sadler's
      Wells,</hi> strict consistency is maintained in the dresses, architecture, and decoration of
     the piece.</p>
    <p>In strict propriety, the costume of the <label>Duke </label>and nobles should consist of
     short, brightly-coloured jerkins, reaching just below the waist, with rather full sleeves,
     slashed, and confined at the wrists, embroidered belts round the waist, coloured tight hose,
     often worn of a different colour in the two legs, and velvet shoes. Short mantles may be worn
     by the young nobles. <label>Ascolti, Malatesta</label>, and the elder guests, may, with
     propriety, wear long velvet or silk gowns, of purple, crimson, or other rich colours, with
     borders of fur.</p>
    <p>The hair should be worn full and long, in the style familiar to us from Raphael's earlier
     pictures. The head-dress of the younger men is a small coloured velvet cap, with a raised edge,
     often scalloped, and ornamented with a chain and medal.</p>
    <p>The <label>Fool</label>, of course, wears a motley suit, with a hood like that worn by
     Shakespeare's fools. His second dress should be a long gown, of sober colour.
      <label>Fiordelisa's</label> dress should be white, or dove-coloured, with scalloped sleeves
     and a tight body. The <label>Duchess's</label> costume, of the same cut, should be of velvet,
     slashed, and embroidered with gold. She may wear a gold net; a silk, or chenille net, would
     also be appropriate to <label>Fiordelisa</label>.</p>
