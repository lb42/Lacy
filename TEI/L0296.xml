    <stage type="setting">Scene .— Mr. Bartholomew Lane's Office, near the Royal Exchange. Door in
     flat, R.</stage>
    <stage> George and O'Grady discovered at their desks. </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George .</speaker>
     <p> 109—18—137; carried up, 137—148—152 —158—64—no 69, no, stop; that's not right, confound
      it!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> <stage>(reading what he has just written.)</stage>"Gentlemen, be pleased to pay." That's a
      mighty odd expression— be pleased to pay! I wonder who the devil would be pleased to pay
      anything! None of my ancestors, I'm sure—if I take after them.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George .</speaker>
     <p> 148, don't talk, Terence,—152—58-</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> Faith, I'd like to see the gentleman who would be pleased to pay! I'd show him for money,
      and make a fortune of him!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George .</speaker>
     <p> Hold your tongue, will you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> Sure, you're not the gentleman who would be pleased to pay, or you'd refund the half-crown
      I lent you a month ago.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George .</speaker>
     <p> Hang your half-crown ! There, <stage>(flinging one to him.)</stage>take it, do, and stop
      your eternal chatter. I shall never get these accounts right. How on earth do you manage to
      write when you're talking to yourself all the time ? You can't be thinking of what you're
      about.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> I am, and of a thousand things beside—I've a wonderful genius !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George.</speaker>
     <p> For making mistakes.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> Sure, I've a right to make 'em; ain't I an Irishman ? I stand up for my national privileges
      !</p>
    </sp>
    <pb n="4"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George.</speaker>
     <p> You abuse your privileges; no Irishman in the world ever made such blunders as you do.
      You're eternally getting yourself, or somebody else, into scrapes by them. What did you do
      yesterday ? I hear there was a crowd round you in Cornhill.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> There was, but it was through you!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George.</speaker>
     <p> Through me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> Through you! every bit of it; I was standing at Birch's eating an oyster patty, when I saw
      you scuttling along on the other side of the way; I called after you, and you wouldn't hear
      me, so I made but one hop, step and a jump, over the road, and coming slyly behind you,
      knocked your hat over your eyes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George.</speaker>
     <p> What d'ye mean? I was at Islington all day, with the governor.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> So you were, for it wasn't you after all, but a fellow I'd never seen before in all my life
      ! " Boh," says I; " Holloa," says he ; " what the devil do you mean by that, sir?" "No offence
      in the world, sir," says I; "but I thought you were my cousin George, sir, " says I, " the
      handsomest young man you'll see in a summer's day, sir." "The Lord forgive me for lying," says
      I to myself; but I couldn't say less to the gentleman, after breaking his hat, and the bridge
      of his nose into the bargain.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George.</speaker>
     <p> I should think not.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> Sure, it was a mighty pretty compliment to pay such a Kangaroo as he was; but that didn't
      satisfy him. " None of your blarney," says he ; " I'll bet you a pound you didn't think any
      such thing." " Done," says I, " I've lost, and there's the money." Faith, he took that easier
      than the compliment; so I had the pleasure of wishing him good morning, and seeing him buy a
      new water-proof best short nap, with my own sovereign.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George.</speaker>
     <p> Serve you right; I wonder he didn't have you up before the Lord Mayor.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> Oh, faith, somebody began calling police in the first instance; but long life to the boys,
      they're never to be seen when they're wanted.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George.</speaker>
     <p> Why, you knew well enough I had gone with my father to Islington. Were you not left in care
      of the office, with all sorts of messages ?</p>
    </sp>
    <pb n="5"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> I was! but I just popped out for a lunch, and forgot all about it, at the moment. By the
      bye, I forgot something else, too,—bad manners to me! What did she say to you—you never told
      me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George.</speaker>
     <p> Say to me! who ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> Who ? why the girl you went to see at Islington, to be sure; Miss Mary Capsicomb. Don't I
      know you went with the governor on purpose to pop the question to her.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George.</speaker>
     <p> Pshaw! stuff!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> Oh, as much stuff as you please—but you know it's true ; didn't you let me into your
      confidence ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George.</speaker>
     <p> Let you in ? no—you broke into it!—opened my letter instead of your own.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> By the merest accident; and I apologised as soon as I'd read it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George.</speaker>
     <p> Apologised—yes, before my father, and so let him into the secret.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> And didn't he approve of your attachment ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George.</speaker>
     <p> By great good luck; but suppose he hadn't ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> Oh, bother! what's the good of supposing disagreeable things that never happened.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George.</speaker>
     <p> Well, at all events, Master Terence, you're the last person I should choose for a
      confidant, and so you'll excuse me telling you anything about the matter.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> You're wrong there, depend upon it—and you'll lose a great deal by it; for I'm in love
      myself, and I'll leave you in blissful ignorance of the whole beautiful story.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George.</speaker>
     <p> With all my heart; but you'll be sure to blunder it out somehow or other.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> Oh, catch me making a blunder in love matters; I'm discreet enough in my indiscretions.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George.</speaker>
     <p> Here's the governor coming, you'd better finish the letters for the post.</p>
    </sp>
    <stage> Enter Mr. Bartholomew Lane, D. R. f. </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lane.</speaker>
     <p> So you're a pretty fellow, don't you think ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George.</speaker>
     <p> Me, Sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lane.</speaker>
     <p> No, not you, your cousin there, Master Terence; my plague! But there shall be an end of it.
      I've looked
      <pb n="6"/>over a great deal on my sister's account; but, unless you pay a little more
      attention, sir, back to Ireland you go, I'm determined.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> What's the row, governor ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lane.</speaker>
     <p> Don't call me, governor, sir. I've told you forty times I don't choose to be called
      governor ! It's a familiarity I don't approve of. I'm your uncle, sir, unfortunately. I can't
      help that. My sister chose to throw herself away upon a handsome Irishman, without a penny,
      and I have been saddled with you, sir, as the natural consequence. I have tried to make a man
      of business of you, but it's in vain; I must give it up, or you'll be the ruin of me?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> The ruin of you? Sure, you are joking, my dear sir; what would I be the ruin of you for
      ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lane.</speaker>
     <p> Didn't I tell you yesterday, before I went out, to write to Mr. Hardup, and tell him, if he
      didn't pay me the money he owed me, before twelve o'clock to-day, I should instruct my
      attorney to commence proceedings ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> You did, and I did.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lane.</speaker>
     <p> You did no such thing, sir! Didn't I tell you at the same time to write to Alderman Turtle,
      and acknowledge the receipt of £100 which he left here the day before ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> You did; and I did, I tell you.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lane.</speaker>
     <p> I did, and you didn't, I tell you. You sent the receipt to Hardup, and the threat of
      proceedings to the Alderman, who is in such a rage, he will hear neither apology or
      explanation. Swears I shall never dine in his house again. A man who gives the best dinners in
      London; and to mend the matter, I've been nearly smothered with blessings by that vagabond
      Hardup, who is running about telling every body my noble and delicate conduct has saved him
      and his family from utter ruin.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> And isn't that a proud consolation to you ? Sure, a poor man's blessing is worth an
      alderman's dinner any day.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lane.</speaker>
     <p> Terence, do you wish me to knock you down, sir?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> That depends upon what's bid for me, sir. I'd be
      <pb n="7"/> a mighty great bargain at the price you'd put me up at.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lane.</speaker>
     <p> You impudent rascal! Don't compel me to kick you out of my house.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> I will not, sir; I'll go as soon as you please, without the kick.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lane.</speaker>
     <p> George, what am I to do with this fellow ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George.</speaker>
     <p> Forgive him this time, sir; he'll be more careful in future—won't you, Terence ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> It's impossible to be more careful. I wrote the letters plain enough. It's the confounded
      covers you've got the fashion of putting 'em in, that makes all the mischief. They'd puzzle
      the Pope, they would!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lane.</speaker>
     <p> Well, sir, I'll forgive you once more; but mind, it's the last time; the next blunder you
      make, back you go to Ireland; or, at least, you don't stay here. So now sit down, sir, and
      write to Sheriff Capsicomb, that the Clapham and Tooting Grand Junction are doing at three and
      a half, and that he had better sell whilst he can.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> I will, sir.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lane.</speaker>
     <p> When you have written it, post it directly. I promised to let him know this morning. George
      will give you his address, and see if you can manage not to mistake this time. I must run back
      and try what's to be done with the alderman. To-morrow's a venison day at Fishmonger's Hall,
      and he's one of the wardens.</p>
     <stage>[ Exit D. R. F.</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> I believe that my uncle would dine with the devil, provided he knew there'd be venison.
      What's the address, George, of your father-in-law that is to be, Mr. Sheriff Capsicomb ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George.</speaker>
     <p> High Street, Islington ; but he's got a charming place at Norwood—gave £4,000 for it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> Pickles for ever ! But I'm told he's as hot and as sour as his own chilly vinegar.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George.</speaker>
     <p> Rather passionate; they say his first wife spoiled his temper.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> Then I hope his second will mend it. Did you see her, George ? They say she's a beauty.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George,</speaker>
     <p> A very charming woman, and not much older than Mary.</p>
    </sp>
    <pb n="8"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> More shame for him; George, you devil, you'll be making love to your mother-in-law!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George.</speaker>
     <p> Write your letters, and don't talk nonsence. <stage rend="alignRight">(takes his hat.</stage> </p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> Stop—ask 'em to honour my cheque for £10,000, and I'll pay'em when I come into my

     <p> He's a good fellow, cousin Georgy, but a little soft in the upper story! Now, let me see if
      this is all right:—" Sir, I am desired by Mr. Bartholomew Lane, to inform you—um, um, um,
      Clapham and Tooting—two- and-a-half—sell while you can. Your obedient servant, Terence
      O'Grady." That's as clear as mud. Now for one of these devils of covers .—" To Mr. Sheriff
      Capsicomb, High Street, Islington." There you are my darling, with a queen's head upon you,
      and no mistake. <stage> [Just as he is going to put the note into the envelope, his attention
      is arrested by a lady passing the window.]</stage>Och, murder! <stage>drops the
      envelope.</stage> It can't be ! It isn't impossible! <stage>runs to window.</stage> I'll give
      £50, when I get it, if you'll only look this way, ma'am ! She does—and it is ! By all the
      cupids that ever Tommy Moore sung about—it's the identical she—my Bristol beauty! The Venus I
      came over with in the steamer from Cork! What'll I do ? Where's my hat ? Confusion, I can't
      find my hat; I'll run without it! I'll follow her to the world's end! Oh, the devil! There's
      nobody to mind the office ; and if the governor comes back and finds me out, I'll be ruined
      entirely! No matter, lucks all! Here goes! <stage>(going out to D. R. F.,
      stops.)</stage> Hah ! by the powers, she's gone into Mrs. Lump's, the grocer's, at the

     <p> Faint heart never won a fair lady! If she don't answer, I can't help it. But the boy shall
      follow her, and find out where she goes to, and all about her. I'll stick to her skirts, now I
      have got a sight of her again, she may take her oath of it. Sure, she can't have forgotten the
      delicate attentions I paid her, when she was so mighty queer with the pitching of the steamer,
      that she'd almost have considered it a personal favour if any one had thrown her overboard.
      Didn't I give her my own brandy and water, and carry her down to the ladies' cabin, in these
      faithful arms, as helpless as a baby ? And didn't I miss her in coming ashore, and never gave
      her an opportunity of expressing her affectionate gratitude! Oh, murder ! Here he comes back,

     <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
     <p> Of course, I remember now, perfectly. I'm indebted to you for some very kind attentions;

     <p> I shall be delighted to make you and Mr. Cap- sicomb acquainted. I have often spoken to him

     <p>Ha, ha! Irish eh?—humph. Sad fellows, Irish. Play the devil with the women. Pretty story

     <p> No doubt, and serve him right, I dare say. But you are not the husband, my dear, and so you

     <p>Very true, my love. No, I am not the husband, and I thank my stars, that with such a model

     <p>Oh, my dear father, I find I can explain this mystery; Terence, evidently, was under the

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> That's it exactly, sir. <stage>aside.</stage> For I've posted the other, directed to her

     <p>The fact is, Mr. Terence knew that I had promised to send him packing the next blunder he

      Mrs. Sheriff Capsicomb, and likely next year to be Lady Mayoress, and go to court, and give
      dinners to all the great people at the west-end. Well, some people are lucky, that's all I
      say. I'm sure I should as soon have thought of seeing the man in the moon walk into the shop.

     <p> My dear Mrs. Lump, you can do me a great service.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
     <p> Bless me, my dear Mrs. Capsicomb, you seem quite in a flustration. Anything, I'm sure, I
      can do—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
     <p> You're a good creature I know, and the only person in London I could speak to on the
      subject. The folly of a young man has placed me in a very awkward position.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
     <p> Dear me! pray go on—this is very interesting.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
     <p> Just before my marriage, I went with my aunt to Ireland, on a visit to some friends ; we
      had a horrid passage back to Bristol, and a young gentleman, on board the steamer, was
      exceedingly attentive to me,</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
     <p> Hah, a handsome young fellow, no doubt.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
     <p> My dear soul, I was too ill to notice a feature of his face. I only know that he lent me
      his cloak upon deck; forced me to drink some brandy and water, and carried me below when I
      couldn't sit up any longer. I couldn't speak to thank him, at the time, and I couldn't see him
      when I landed; Mr. Capsicomb was waiting for me, with a fly, and I never thought to have set
      eyes upon the man again.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
     <p> But you have—and he has declared himself.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
     <p> I dont know what he has done; but from his alarm, and a few hurried words he uttered, I
      fear he has been guilty of some folly which may seriously embroil me with my husband.</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
     <p> Good gracious ! but can't you explain ?</p>

     <p> Explain! oh, my dear friend, you don't know Mr. Capsicomb, with his jealousy and violent
      temper.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
     <p> Jealousy! violent temper! dear, dear, just like poor Lump; and I, who was only saying to
      myself, as you came in, what a lucky girl you were to get such a husband.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
     <p> Ah, well! it can't be helped now. He's very fond of me, and all that; but I've no time to
      loose, so let me tell you what I want you to do for me. This young man, is a neighbour of
      yours, and if you will see him, and ascertain what he has done that—</p>

     <speaker>Lane.</speaker>
     <p>How dare you!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Caps.</speaker>
     <p>There—there, you hear your nephew acknowledge it. Mr. O'Grady, give me your hand; I've done
      you an injustice. I see you have only been guilty of a pardonable mistake, in posting this
      letter instead of leaving your uncle to hand it to me to-day after dinner, by way of a
      <hi>bonne bouche ! </hi></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> Exactly—that's it; you're a witch, Sheriff; (<stage>(aside.)</stage>) What's it about, I
      wonder ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Caps.</speaker>
     <p>To think of old Peter Potter making a fortune in India, and paying twenty shillings in the
      pound, after all!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lane.</speaker>
     <p>Why you don't say so ! Why he owed you three or four thousand pounds ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Caps.</speaker>
     <p>£3,675 14s. 3d.; and you knew he was going to pay me, with fifteen years interest on the
      money. The letter came under cover to you; he says so.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lane.</speaker>
     <p>There was an India letter, certainly, with an enclosure for you.</p>
    </sp>
    <pb n="34"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Caps.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, there was ; and not a word, of course, to give you a hint; come, come, it won't do,</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> No, no, it won't do; the murder's all out the Sheriff knows all about it. It's spoilt the
      fun a little, but no matter, Sheriff, I wish you joy; Mrs. Capsicomb I wish you joy.
      <stage>shakes hands. </stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Caps.</speaker>
     <p>To be sure, to be sure; and wish George and Mary joy, for they shall come in for their share
      of the windfall.</p>
     <stage>O'Grady shakes hands with them. John offers his hand, which O'Grady knocks away.</stage>
     <p> Mrs. Lump, I hope you'll forget my being a little hasty. As an old friend of my wife's, I
      shall be happy to see you at Prospect Lodge.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. L.</speaker>
     <p> Oh, Mr. Sheriff—I'm sure—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Caps.</speaker>
     <p>Mr. O'Grady, you'll dine with us to day ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> With the greatest—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lane.</speaker>
     <p> No, no, he can't, he's going a long journey on particular business!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> The devil I am! Where to ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lane.</speaker>
     <p>To Cork, <hi>via</hi> Bristol!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> To Cork ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lane.</speaker>
     <p> <stage>aside.</stage> This very afternoon. So make hastepack up, and pack off, or I'll tell
      the Sheriff everything.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> Oh, governor! Uncle, darling; sure—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lane.</speaker>
     <p>Not a word; I've done with you; I'll pay your expenses back, and that's all; so come along
      !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> I beg your pardon, that's my hat, here's yours. <stage>gives him the crushed hat. </stage>
      I'd change with you, but I've further to go than you have—if you won't take pity on poor
      Terence O'Grady and let him stop-—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lane.</speaker>
     <p> No !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>O'G.</speaker>
     <p> Ladies and gentlemen—speak a good word for me to the governor; mine has been the pursuit of
      letters, under difficulties; encourage me in it, and allow me to correspond with you, every
      evening, by means of—The Irish Post. </p>
