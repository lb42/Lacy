    <head>Willikind AND HIS DINAH.</head>
    <p>In presenting this Doleful Tragedy for the first time on the Stage of any Theatre, it is
     believed that a few particulars relative to its literary history will neither prove unimportant
     nor uninteresting. The play itself, which has been recently discovered amongst the papers of a
     retired Cheesemonger, belongs apparently to the Elizabethan period ; a supposition rendered
     more probable by a Latin inscription on the fly-leaf, which, though nearly obliterated by time,
     may be decyphered thus:—"Mihi et Betti Martini," signifying, doubtless, the names of the joint
     Authors as Myself and Elizabeth Martin names which, though not familiar, perhaps, to the
     students of our early dramatic history, are yet of no rare occurrence in popular literature. As
     the most indefatigable researches in the British Museum have failed to bring to light any
     quarto or folio edition of “Ye Tragicalle Hystorie of Willikind and his Dinah, with ye manner
     of theyre love-makynge, ye cruelle Parent’s enmitie, and theyre most pittiful ends,” there is
     reason to believe that it was never printed, and, consequently, it is fair to assume that it
     was never published. The original story on which the plot was based seems equally to have
     baffled the investigation of those who sought to trace the legend to its primitive source. An
     anonymous writer in a work dated 1583, and entitled “A Paradise of Curious Conceits and Daintie
     Devices,” alludes to a similar story, in which a Parent refuses consent to a Daughter’s
     Marriage. The name of Willikind, however, seems unknown in the Parish Registers before 1602,
     when it figures in an entry, which would seem to show that a person of that name then existed;
     but whether it was the same individual—there is now no possible method of ascertaining.—Dinah,
     or Dian-ah—the interjection “ah!” having been palpably appended to the first syllable to
     express the melancholy nature of her career,—has been often made the subject of reference by
     the lyrists of Ethiopia, but there is no reason for supposing that they could throw any light
     on the present history. Under these circumstances, as it appears that no information can be
     gained by pursuing the inquiry any further, it seems to be most advisable to desist from the
     attempt, and the curious in these etymological, genealogical, and archaeological researches
     are, therefore, confidently referred to the Tragedy itself, which will be found to embrace all
     the particulars hitherto unknown and unrecorded.</p>

   <head>Willikind AND HYS DINAH</head>
   <div type="scene">
    <stage type="setting">SCENE I.—"The Front Garding" of the Rich Merchant's Mansion, at Hackney.
     At the back a high clipped hedge enclosing the garden. A large scroll-work iron gate in centre
     of the hedge with two stone piers, surmounted by statues of grotesque lions. Through the gate
     is seen a road and country landscape. The front of the Merchant's Mansion (R.H.) with
     practicable door, and window above opening on a balcony. The garden is laid out in grass plats,
     gravelled walks, and parterres—box-wood trees clipped into fantastical forms ; a rustic seat,
     watering pot, garden roller. A water-butt painted green, at comer of garden next the house, U.
     B., a pair of green library steps beside the water-butt. Time, sunrise. The Barcarole, from
     Masaniello, played on a flageolet by Willikind at a distance, and gradually approaching; the
     sparrows on all sides twitter an accompaniment to the music. Willikind then appears outside the
     gate (c.), looks over, and sings.</stage>
    <spGrp>
     <head>Air—"Willikind and his Dinah."</head>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Wil.</speaker>
      <l>" Here lives the rich merchant, I know very well, </l>
      <l>Who has for a daughter an unkimmin fine young gal;</l>
      <l>Her name it is Dinah, just sixteen years old, </l>
      <l>With a very large fortin in silver and gold.</l>
      <l>Singe-ing too-ral-li, too-ral-li."</l>
      <l>She sleeps! alone my Dinah sleeps </l>
      <l>Upon her couch of down. Oh, happy couch! </l>
      <l>Oh, downy couch! and far more downier maid ! </l>
      <l>Perchance she snores! and, snoring, dreams of me, </l>
      <l>Her Willikind. But soft! the morning breaks. </l>
      <l>And rises like a baker in the (y)east ;</l>
      <l>While, through the blanket of the night, his rays </l>
      <l>Like streaks upon a Ribston pippin shine.</l>
      <stage>(a dog barks)</stage>
      <l>The dogs begin to bark, <stage>(a cock crows)</stage>the cocks to crow; <stage>(sparrows
       twitter)</stage></l>
      <pb n="5"/>
      <l>The smoke-dried sparrows, twittering in the hedge. </l>
      <l>Proclaim that Nature’s wide awake:—why, then, </l>
      <l>I’ll wake my Dinah with a tender strain.</l>
     </sp>
    </spGrp>
    <stage>Plays "Away with Melancholy," on his flageolet; the sparrows, as before, twittering an
     accompaniment. At the close of the air, Dinah opens upper window, (R.) and comes on the balcony
     in her morning wrapper.</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Din.</speaker>
     <l>Dear Willikind, was thine the strain ?</l>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Wil.</speaker>
     <l>It was.</l>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Din.</speaker>
     <l>Oh, gentle lark! what lark has made you leave </l>
     <l>Your nest, to warble at my parent’s gate?</l>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Wil.</speaker>
     <l>’Twas all along of you and love. Last night </l>
     <l>I could not sleep: and long before ’twas time </l>
     <l>To take the shutters down, I left my flock.</l>
     <l>My <hi>only</hi>flock, in bed, and from your parent’s shop </l>
     <l>In Little Britain flew on Cupid’s wing. </l>
     <l>To flutter at these cruel bars, that bar me from </l>
     <l>Those arms. Oh, barb’rous barrier ! oh, rude </l>
     <l>And ruthless railings, reckless of my raps!</l>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Din.</speaker>
     <l>Just play that melting air again; yet stay, </l>
     <l>I’d better pitch you first the proper key. </l>
     <l>’Tis here, upon this bunch—<stage>(undoes a key from a bunch which she carries)</stage>Say,
      canst thou catch ?</l>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Wil.</speaker>
     <l>Ask thine own heart. Thou knowest how I’ve caught</l>
     <l>Thy smallest meaning through thy slightest wink; </l>
     <l>Thou also know’st how, once upon a time— </l>
     <l>Casting thy careful parent’s day-book up,— </l>
     <l>My custom always of an afternoon— </l>
     <l>Thou hanging o’er my shoulder—all the while </l>
     <l>I popped and carried kisses, till I made </l>
     <l>A blunder in the tottle of the whole :— </l>
     <l>Oh! ask thy father how I caught it then.</l>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Din.</speaker>
     <l>Enough ! There, take, and turn it, in the lock— </l>
     <l>But softly, mind—while I put on my frock.</l>
    </sp>
    <stage>(she throws him the key over the hedge, and retires into the house. Willikind picks up
     the key)</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Wil.</speaker>
     <l>Hooray! hooray! By Jove, a lucky throw. </l>
     <l>And now by single entry in I go.</l>
     <stage>(unlocks the garden gate and enters)</stage>
     <l>Oh! what a spot for love and syllabub ! </l>
     <l>A little paradise—with Dinah—where </l>
     <l>The air breathes milder, and the flow’rs blow bigger,</l>
     <pb n="6"/>
     <l>The sky looks brighter and the green grass greener; </l>
     <l>Ev’n I feel softer than my wont; and so, </l>
     <l>To Echo’s ear my feelings I’ll confide. </l>
     <l>Thus tragic lovers pour their fancies forth. </l>
     <l>And operatic tenors who disdain </l>
     <l>To keep the noiseless tenor of their way, </l>
     <l>Vociferate their secret thoughts in song.</l>
     <stage>SONG—Willikind. Air—Drops of Brandy.</stage>
     <l>A merchant in London there dwells, </l>
     <l>Whose profit two hundred per cent, is, </l>
     <l>Derived from whatever he sells, </l>
     <l>And I am this merchant’s apprentice.</l>
     <l>From me you must here understand, </l>
     <l>A fortune he made by his trickery, </l>
     <l>Putting in sugar the sand, </l>
     <l>And popping in coffee the chicory.</l>
     <l>Thus getting on with avidity,<lb/>
     </l>
     <l>Soon was a fortune supplied o’.<lb/>
     </l>
     <l>But how it was made with rapidity,<lb/>
     </l>
     <l>No one knows better than I do.</l>
     <l>At Hoxton this villa he bought. </l>
     <l>He could not get one that was nigherer. </l>
     <l>To which his fair daughter he brought; </l>
     <l>And I am that daughter’s admierer.</l>
     <l>We’ve long been attached, she and I— </l>
     <l>To see her, O how my heart flutters up!</l>
     <l>And sometimes we meet on the sly, </l>
     <l>At night when I’ve put the shop shutters up. </l>
     <l>Nothing is done by timidity, </l>
     <l>Always awake I am wide o’, </l>
     <l>A fortune ain’t got by stupidity— </l>
     <l>None knows that better than I do.</l>
     <l>But soft, my Dinah comes. That step is her’s ; </l>
     <l>More light than footfall of the cautious cat, </l>
     <l>When cream she seeks upon the dairy shelf.</l>
     <stage>Enter Dinah from house R. He embraces her. </stage>
     <l>Oh, Dinah, lovely Dinah, tell me true, </l>
     <l>Is this thy angel form—and no mistake ?</l>

     <speaker>Wil.</speaker>
     <l>Why, then,</l>
     <l>Let Chaos come and turn this solid globe</l>
     <l>Like that at Leicester-square—right inside out;</l>
     <pb n="7"/>
     <l>Let bridges run beneath the muddy Thames,</l>
     <l>Let boiling kettles on the highway snort, </l>
     <l>Let people fly,—to monster bladders tied, </l>
     <l>Let messages by lightning be conveyed,</l>
     <l>Let beauteous Smithfield be removed ; and, oh ! </l>
     <l>Let there be never more a Lord Mayor's show ! </l>
     <l>Let everything most terrible befal—.</l>
     <l>I love my Dinah, and I scorn them all.</l>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Din.</speaker>
     <l>Oh, Blarney—rather—</l>
    </sp>

     <l>Did you say, Blarney ?</l>
     <l>Recal that hateful word, or by the powers </l>
     <l>Of twelve Attorneys roll’d in one—I’ll do </l>
     <l>Some desperate deed of slaughter on myself— </l>
     <l>I’ll cut my thread of life with dagger keen, </l>
     <l>Or quench my spirit in yon water butt.</l>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Din.</speaker>
     <l>You can’t—the butt’s as empty as your head.</l>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Wil.</speaker>
     <l>Then to some dreary dismal shore I’ll go,</l>
     <l>Whose sullen savage rocks have never heard “Pop goes the Weasel,” or “ The Low-back’d Car,” </l>
     <l>Or hurdy gurdy, or an organ ground. </l>
     <l>There, like a lonely ’ermit in an ‘ut— </l>
     <l>Pale ale my drink—walnuts my only food— </l>
     <l>I’ll waste life’s taper—to its latest snuff; </l>
