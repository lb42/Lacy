</sp>
<sp who="#L0848_M2">
<speaker>Harry.</speaker>
<p>And not without reason, dear Lisette, Tom Gordon will presently be here.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0848_F11">
<speaker>Lisette.</speaker>
<p>Well, why should you fear—are you not brothers ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0848_M2">
<speaker>Harry.</speaker>
<p>Yes, dearest! but Tom Gordon was born free— <hi>his</hi> mother was the
<hi>wife</hi> of Colonel Gordon, and a white woman— <hi>my</hi> mother was a
slave—her son is a slave—and yet my father loved me, educated me, so reared me,
that now I am like the bat in the fable, neither bird nor beast; when Colonel
Gordon died, he left this estate to poor Nina, another to Tom, and left, also,
his command that Nina should be kept ignorant that I was her brother.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0848_F11">
<speaker>Lisette.</speaker>
<p>Why not have told me this before, dear Harry.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0848_M2">
<speaker>Harry.</speaker>
<p>For reasons which you will ere long comprehend. The colonel on his dying bed
told me that he had given a sealed paper to Nina, which was not to be opened
until she had attained the age of twenty-one, and when that period arrived I
should find, he said, that he had done me full justice; till then, he desired
that I should manage the estate for Nina as a servant, and a slave.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0848_F11">
<speaker>Lisette.</speaker>
<p>What could have been his motive ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0848_M2">
<speaker>Harry.</speaker>
<p>He feared that, rendered free, I might become as bad as Tom, who, almost from
his cradle, had been a curse to his parents, and to all surrounding him. Poor
Nina, though she knew not I was her brother, yet loved me like one, would have
given me freedom, but, of course, dared not—nor did I desire that she should,
for I felt certain that the paper left by my father, Colonel Gordon, would give
me that and an ample provision—but who can foresee the decrees of <pb n="8"/>Providence! Three months since, poor Nina was suddenly stricken with a fatal
malady, and died on the very morning of her twenty-first birth-day.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0848_F11">
<speaker>Lisette.</speaker>
<p>And the document left by the colonel—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0848_M2">
<speaker>Harry.</speaker>
<p>Can nowhere be found. Up to the present moment vain has been every search,
and, in default of that paper, Tom Gordon claims this estate, and will presently
arrive to take possession ; he hates, has ever hated me—is a bold, bad man,-
caring naught for ties of blood, and I am his slave.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0848_F11">
<speaker>Lisette.</speaker>
<p>Horrible!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0848_M2">
<speaker>Harry.</speaker>
<p>And you, Lisette, my adored wife, are also his slave; for the deed that would
have rendered you free, lacks poor Nina's signature, which was to have been
appended on the very morning she died. You see plainly now, do you not, the
horrors of our situation, and will no longer wonder that I am sad ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0848_F11">
<speaker>Lisette.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I perceive that we have no hope save in the discovery of the document
left by Colonel Gordon.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0848_M2">
<speaker>Harry.</speaker>
<p>Yes, one other hope, Dred.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0848_F11">
<speaker>Lisette.</speaker>
<p>Dred ! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0848_M2">
<speaker>Harry.</speaker>
<p>Ay, should Tom Gordon's oppression, as I fear, become too hard to bear, then
we will escape to the Great Dismal Swamp—join Dred and the revolted slaves, and
patiently await the moment when we may strike the blow that shall give us
liberty.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0848_F11">
<speaker>Lisette.</speaker>
<p>Your father, had he loved you, would not have left your freedom to
chance.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0848_M2">
<speaker>Harry.</speaker>
<p>Oh, the love that fathers have for such as <hi>me</hi> is not like the love
they feel for their white children; they are half ashamed of us, and quite
ashamed to show their love if they have it. Oh! how often I have wished that I
were a good honest black nigger, then I should know what I was; now, I am
neither one thing nor the other, I come just near enough to the condition of the
white man to look into it, and to appreciate it. I have been educated as a
gentleman, and am left a slave, and a slave to a devil, who will delight in
goading me to despair.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0848_F11">
<speaker>Lisette.</speaker>
<p>Dear Harry, we will hope for the best, hope, and pray.</p>

Heaven, avenge us of our adversaries. A man but wisheth to eat the fruit of his
labour, and the hunters are set upon him, the decree goes forth against him,
even the curse of Cain, so that whosoever findeth him shall kill him. Have I not

down on them. What does the rattlesnake do ? lie in their path and bite. Why did
they make slaves of us ? they tried the wild Indians first—why didn't they keep
to them? <hi>they </hi> wouldn't be slaves, and we <hi>will;</hi> they that
<hi>will</hi> bear the yoke, may bear it.</p>
