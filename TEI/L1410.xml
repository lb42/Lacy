   <stage type="setting">Scene —A Room, comfortably furnished. Folding doors, C., and doors, R. and
    L. ; chairs; sideboard, R.C.; footstool; dining table, a little to the L. C.</stage>
   <stage> Mary discovered, dusting the furniture, and Simon assisting her. </stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p> Now, do make haste! You are the slowest boy that ever I saw.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>Boy, indeed! Where do you get your men, I should like to know?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>Call yourself a man ? Where’s your beard ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>It’s coming; I feel it growing every day.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>Sprouting, you mean. You are an impudent monkey; and what a guy you do look in those
     clothes!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>I knows it; it’s all Miss Jane’s doings—a-shoving me into this second-hand suit, belonging to
     some dead and gone Buttons. I was a deal happier a-taking out candles to the customers. Them
     gals have got sich high notions, it’s disgustin’. ’Cos Simon is common, they’ve re-christened
     me Julius. I wonder what the row’s about to-day.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>Why, the young ladies have met with a young man ——<stage>(leaning over R. of table)</stage>
    </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>A wery common case, <stage>(leaning over L. of table)</stage> </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>And they’re spoony on him, and think he’s going to propose.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>That’s natural.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>And marry — </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>That’s unnatural—if they means all on ’em.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>All on ’em—no ! It’s only the Mormons as is allowed any amount of wives, and they’re being
     put a stop to. They sets their face against it in England. <stage>(advancing)</stage> </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>Wery proper, too. Which of the gals is it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>Well, that’s the puzzle; they don’t know.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>That’s awk’ard.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>Very. You see, they met him at their Aunt
     <pb n="4"/> Barkins’s house, when they were stopping there. He showed all those little delicate
     attentions which we women understands and appreciates. Miss Jane and Miss Sarah have done
     nothing but quarrel ever since the letter came. Miss Jane’s certain it’s for her; Miss Sarah
     says it’s her.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>What a lark if it’s Miss Maggie, and they’re reckoning their chickens a bit too soon !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>Rubbish! She’s a child ; nobody would think of her for the next five years.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>Men and women differ in them matters. All I thinks is this—Master be pretty well worried out
     of his life atween them all. He’d better have stuck to tallow; for tallow will always stick to
     him.</p>
    <stage> Maggie runs on from L. C.</stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Maggie.</speaker>
    <p>Oh, Mary—such fun! They’re at it again.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>What, quarrelling?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Maggie.</speaker>
    <p> Yes; and what do you think I have done ? I have got Jane’s best chignon, that she wanted to
     wear to-day ; and she’s in such a rage. Here it is <stage>(showing it)</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p> You naughty girl, the house won’t be able to hold her. Give it me.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Maggie.</speaker>
    <p>Oh! wouldn’t you like to have it? Catch me, and you shall. <stage>(Maggie runs round stage,
     Mary after her) </stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Simon</speaker>
    <p>, <stage>(stands laughing L.) </stage>Two to one on the filly!</p>
    <stage>Enter Jane, L. C.—Maggie runs against her, nearly knocking her down—Simon suddenly stops
     laughing on seeing her. </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p> How dare you! you naughty girl! What is the meaning of this disgraceful disturbance ? Mary,
     your conduct is most reprehensible!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Maggie.</speaker>
    <p>No, don’t blame her, sister, it is all my fault.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>You are a very bad girl, and ought to be kept at school. I shall tell your papa so ! Mary,
     have you seen my hair improver ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>Lor, no miss, had.I’d have known it in a minute, if I had</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Maggie</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(aside) </stage>Simon, take it and put in your pocket. <stage>(Simon takes
     it—pretends to be looking the other way and forces it into his pocket) </stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>I should like to know who has dared to take it ? I would discharge them instantly.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Simon</speaker>
    <p><stage>(aside to Maggie)</stage> Oh, lord, I shall lose my place !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Maggie,</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(aside to him)</stage> No, you won’t—it’s all right!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>Does cook understand about the dinner ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>Yes miss—I think so.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(giving a paper)</stage> Tell her that is the <hi>menu </hi>as the
     <pb n="5"/> dishes are to be served; and you, Julius, recollect that everything you bring into
     the room is brought on the salver. Now go about your work.</p>
    <stage> (Mary crosses to Simon—Simon speaks aside to her as they go off) </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>If this here shig-non is found on me, I am a dead buttons. <stage>Exeunt, L</stage>.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>I request, Margaret, that you behave yourself before Mr. Tinkler, he is a gentleman, and not
     used to foolish, giddy girls.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Maggie.</speaker>
    <p>I dare say he likes them better than stiff, conceited old maids.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>You impertinent minx!</p>
    <stage> Enter Sarah and Mr. Glubb, door, R.— the former is dressed in white, her hair hanging
     loosely down her back, she has a book of poetry in her hand—the latter has very old-fashioned
     cut breeches and gaiters on, and waistcoat, a modern white necktie with large bow to it, and a
     perfectly modern and fashionably-cut dress coat. </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p> Now, Sally, do let me alone ! I tell you I ain’t a-going to take off my gaiters, and wear
     them trowser things for nobody. I’m an old fool to give way as I have done, and put on this
     fine coat. I feels like a pig in armour.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Maggie.</speaker>
    <p>Oh, what a Guy! Daddy, I wish it was the fifth of November—I’d make lots of money with you.
     <stage>(crossing to him)</stage> </p>
    <l>Please to remember the fifth of November, &amp;c.</l>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p> Be quiet, you young monkey, calling your father a Guy. What do you mean by it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>Miss Margaret, hold your tongue immediately! <stage>(Maggie makes grimace at her and turns up
     stage)</stage> </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sarah.</speaker>
    <p>But, papa, Jane and I wish you to appear the pink of fashion, and the mould of form.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p> Drat the fashion, and as for moulds, I’d back mine again any in the City.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Maggie</speaker>
    <p><stage>, (advancing) </stage>Oh,there is a conceited old daddy! <stage>(Jane and Sarah look
     at her—she makes a grimace and turns away) </stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb</speaker>
    <p> It aint every chandler as know’s the real moulds, from the sham ’uns, when they see’s
     em.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <p>>Jane.</p>
    <p>We are not talking of candles, but of your figure, papa. Your waistcoat and etcetera are most
     <hi>outré.</hi> </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p> I don’t see what a tray has got to do with me or my clothes either, my dear. They are a
     precious deal more comfortable than this coat, which I feel I shall bust out of every
     minute.</p>
    <pb n="6"/>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Maggie.</speaker>
    <p>Oh, what fun if you did ! <stage>(laughing and clapping her hands</stage> </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>Your elder sister is speaking, miss, hold your tongue !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Maggie.</speaker>
    <p>Bother! my tongue was made to speak with, not to hold!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sarah.</speaker>
    <p><stage> crossing and pushing Maggie aside) </stage>Papa, Margaret had better leave the room,
     and I will read Mr. Tinkler’s charming letter. She is too young to hear a declaration which
     <quote>
     <l>" Like the lava flood,”</l>
     <l>« That burns in Etna’s breast of flame,”</l> </quote> now rages in his bosom.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p> He’ll be burnt to a cinder if he goes on blazing like that; so I suppose we’d better hear
     him. <stage><stage>(sitting down, R.)</stage> </stage>Oh, drat this coat! I know I shall bust
     out on it.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Maggie.</speaker>
    <p>Mayn’t I stay, daddy ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p> Yes, you may stay. I suppose you wouldn’t be long afore you found out all about love an’
     marriage, an’ all such nonsense. It’s the first thing gals really think about, and you may as
     well begin to learn now.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>Papa—remember, she is but a child! <stage>(L. of table)</stage> </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>What o’ that ? children be often a precious sight wiser than older folks ! Let’s hear t’
     chap’s letter—I suppose it’s a long ’un ; young fellows in love are devils to talk.</p>
    <stage> (Maggie sits on stool near her father—Sarah at back of table) </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sarah</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(reading very affectedly)</stage> "My fondest Rose,”—How pathetic!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>Entrancingly so—I feel it deeply!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sarah.</speaker>
    <p> You ? how absurd—he addresses me!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>What vanity!<stage>(aside)</stage> A gawky creature.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sarah.</speaker>
    <p> To think he could love such a full-blown rose as you are.></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(interrupting them)</stage> There, there, that’ll do—don’t reckon your chickens afore
     they’re hatched. Read the letter first, we’ll settle who it is for, afterwards. If I don’t like
     the young fellow, neither of you gets him—so go on !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sarah.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>reading)</stage> "My fondest Rose—my Rose without a thorn, I love you — the gaiety
     and simplicity of your nature —I told you it was for me !— has conquered your Tinkler. I intend
     calling to see the Governor to-day.—I remain, my Passion Flower, yours till death, and after.—
     John Tinkler.” </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>How beautifully he expresses himself!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sarah.</speaker>
    <p>His meaning lies deep, like the language of flowers.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>Yes—he’s very flowery. But I don’t see as he’s a boiling over like Etna’s crater—as you
     talked about, his
     <pb n="6"/> letter don’t say so. What does he call one of my gals Rose for?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sarah.</speaker>
    <p>A delicate compliment—he told me he was a poet.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>A poet won’t do for my son-in-law -poetry and tallow don’t amalgamate.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>He told me he was an officer.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>Worse still, tallow and red cloth don’t amalgamate— it always shows the grease spots !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Maggie.</speaker>
    <p>He told me he was a merchant !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>That be better—but he can’t be all three. Has he got any money?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sarah.</speaker>
    <p>What is money ?<stage>(>starting up, all do the same)</stage> </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>What is money? Why, money’s money. The world don’t believe in anybody without it; no more do
     I— ’specially as a husband for one of my daughters, <stage>(they advance)</stage> </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>He is a gentleman, papa; unquestionably rich; so you will receive him like one—won’t you? And
     you understand, we dine <hi>à la Russe.</hi> </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>Aye ! I don’t know what that be. I’d sooner a deal have dined off a goose ; but, for once,
     thou mun have thy way. <stage>(a loud knocking) </stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sarah,</speaker>
    <p><stage>(theatrically, R.)</stage> He comes—he comes.</p>
   </sp>

    <p><stage>(imitating her, L.)</stage> He do—he do !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>Papa, retire into the other room.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>Nay, nay ! this'll do.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>No; this must be the reception room. He must not be found here.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>What does it matter where we’re found, if we want to give him a hearty welcome ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>It is not the fashion. We must be announced in the usual way. Retire to this room.

    <p>I never said so.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tink.</speaker>
    <p> But you thought it—it’s all the same. Old women like it as well. Can’t be too old, either;
     it’s the nature of your sex. Where are the young ladies?</p>

    <p> By Jove, how odd!</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>What is odd ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tink.</speaker>
    <p> Nothing. <stage>(kissing her twice)</stage> That’s even.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>Oh, sir—don’t!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Iink.</speaker>
    <p> Nonsense! You like it; all the girls do; so do the old women; can’t be too old either. I
     say, what sort of young ladies are yours, when they are at home ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>Same sort as when they are out, sir?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tink.</speaker>
    <p> Mary, you got out the right side of the bed this morning. You are too sharp. You won’t be
     communicative?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>No—can’t.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tink.</speaker>
    <p> Why not ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>My conscience won't let me.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tink.</speaker>
    <p> What’s the price of your conscience?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>Half-a-crown ; cheap on this occasion.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tink.</speaker>
    <p> Because you admire the purchaser. I buy it. Going— going — gone! <stage>(imitating
     auctioneer)</stage> Your conscience is knocked down to me. There is the money, <stage>(giving
     it)</stage> Now unburthen.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>Well, sir, first and foremost—do you know their names ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tink.</speaker>
    <p> Not exactly. When I wrote I addressed "My Rose.” If not correct, it sounded poetical. One of
     them goes in for that sort of thing—doesn’t she?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>Yes; Miss Sarah, she’s always a-spouting poetry— play-acting, master calls it. Then she’s
     awful careless about her hair; goes about with it hanging down her back, and says it’s
     <hi>negligee,</hi> and betokens genius; all poets and poetesses does it. She’s what they call
     moon-struck.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tink.</speaker>
    <p> No wonder,—there’s a man in it. I thought I took her measure. Another one goes in for
     fashion ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>That is Miss Jane—she’s awful disagreeable, and upsets the house and everybody in it with her
     fine notions.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tink.</speaker>
    <p> How about the young daughter ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>Miss Maggie—she’s the best and the cleverest—no nonsense about her—a bit rompish, that’s
     all.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tink.</speaker>
    <p> I like her all the better for that. I say, Mary, is your master warm?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>Depends on the state of the weather.</p>
   </sp>

    <p> No, no—has he got much money?</p>

    <p>Oh, lots!</p>

    <p>Indeed— the men ?</p>

    <p>Then I’ll tell you, it’s because of you’re coming— I ain’t got patience with it. I used to
     think when we Tallow Chandlers dined together in the City, it were bad enough, to put down a
     lot o’ names for the dishes, as not one on us could read; much less tell what they were made
     on—it’s downright humbug, a-doing it—mutton is mutton—fowls is fowls - and

   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>So she will, if she likes you, 1’11 give her to thee, but we won’t say aught to the other
     gals till they’ve had
     <pb n="14"/> their dinner, for it’ll spoil it for ’em. Give us thy hand upon the bargain.
     <stage>(they shake hands warmly, at that moment Simon who has entered just previously door, C.,
     carrying a gong or large bell—strikes on it or rings it very loudly—both Glubb and Tinkler jump
     away from each other startled)</stage> What the devil’s that? <stage>(Simon begins beating
     again—Glubb looks round and sees him—Tinkler goes to corner, R., putting his fingers in his
     ears to lessen the sound)</stage> Stop that row. Do you hear me ? Stop, I say. <stage>(Simon
     stops at length)</stage> You young vagabond, what d’ye mean making that noise ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>I am only doing what I was ordered. Miss Jane, told me to borrow this here thing from the
     ironmonger’s over the way, and whack it when the dinner was ready. <stage>(strikes it
     again)</stage> </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>Be quiet, you scoundrel, or I’ll whack you! <stage> Runs towards him—Exit Simon, hastily,
     C.</stage></p>
    <stage> Enter Miss Jane, Sarah, and Maggie, door, R.</stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>I thought I heard the dinner gong? <stage>(very dignified)</stage> </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>Heard it; you must have been precious deaf if you didn’t. I shall have this house complained
     of as a nuisance, you’ll frighten all the neighbourhood. I won’t have such nonsense.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane</speaker>
    <p><stage>(aside)</stage> Hush, papa; remember your promise to be good for once, and let us have
     our way.</p>
    <stage> Enter Mary and Simon, C.—Simon has white cotton gloves on, much too large for him.
    </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>Well, I’ll say no more. Sit thee down, Mr. Tinkler <stage>(Glubb sits at head of
     table—Tinkler is going to sit, R.— Jane and Saraii cough—he immediately recollects himself, and
     goes towards them)</stage> </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tink.</speaker>
    <p>A thousand pardons! Allow me <stage>(he is about to offer his arm to Sarah, who is just
     taking it, when Jane comes quickly between them and takes his arm, and Tinkler leads her to a

   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sarah</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(indignantly)</stage> An impudent creature! <stage>(aloud)</stage> Papa, papa, come
     and lead me to a seat.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>What for ? Hast fallen lame ? Can’t you lead yourself?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane</speaker>
    <p><stage>(aside)</stage> Papa, it’s the fashion ; do it directly.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(getting up and going to her—aside)</stage> Well, this fashion be a rum thing. Gals

    <p><stage>(calling Simon aside)</stage> Here, Julius Cæsar, conduct
     <pb n="15"/>me to a seat, <stage>(imitating her sisters—Simon gives her his arm awkwardly—Sarah
     and Jane do not see it until they get near the table—when they do they start up—the soup by
     this time is served by Mary and Simon, a little in each plate—Glubb tucks his napkin under his
     chin)</stage> </p>

   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Maggie.</speaker>
    <p>I don’t see why I shouldn’t have some one to lead me, as well as you. <stage>(sits L., next

   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>This be a little drop—not a spoonfull! What is it?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Simon</speaker>
    <p><stage>(aside to Mary)</stage> He wants to know what it is. Whisper, <stage>(she takes out
     paper, and prompts him, as he says)</stage> Pu'ree de gib-i-er aux quarrells.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>It’s soup, papa.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>Soup! It’s enough to make anyone quarrel over it. Why, it ain’t enough for a babby—much less
     a man. Bring it all up, Simon.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>Please, sir — </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>Papa!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>I will have it! I must have my food, Jane. <stage>Simon runs off, C. </stage>You may do what
     you like, but I’m not going to be starved, after waiting until tea-time for my dinner.</p>
    <stage> Enter Simon, c., bringing soup in a large common washhand basin. </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary</speaker>
    <p><stage>(stopping him)</stage> What are you doing? </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>What master tells me.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>Quite right! Bring it here. What’s this ? Does the cook make the soup in a washhand basin
     ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(seeing it)</stage> Good gracious !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sarah.</speaker>
    <p>Oh, heavens!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>Cook wasn’t looking, or she’d have stopped me. You told me to bring it, so ’tain’t my
     fault.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p> How dare she make it in such a thing?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>Well, miss, I suppose it’s French fashion. She said it didn’t matter what it was made in, as
     long as you didn’t see it, and the washhand basin was handiest at the time, <stage>(they all
     make grimaces, and put down their spoons)</stage> </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>Take it away. <stage>(Mary and Simon clear away soup plates)</stage> </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>Take all the plates away, and bring us something else. It’ll be lucky if we get anything for
     dinner with all these fine-fangled notions. I hope you’re not hungry, Mr. Tinkler ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tink.</speaker>
    <p>Not at all. <stage>(aside)</stage> I am as hungry as an alligator.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>That’s lucky, because you ain’t likely to get much, if the rest of the dishes are served
     <hi>a la goose,</hi> like the soup.</p>
    <pb n="16"/>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tink.</speaker>
    <p>The pleasure of making your acquaintance, and being introduced to your charming family circle
     <stage>(they all bow)</stage> is enough to make one say—— <stage>(by this time Simon and Mary
     have served round fresh plates—Simon is handing the cutlets, and is standing to help Tinkler—he
     is bowing as others are, and upsets the cutlets into Tinkler’s lap, who starts up, exclaiming,
     "Confound it!")</stage></p>

    <p>There was a fall indeed ! <stage>(tragically)</stage> </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>Mr. Tinkler, that fool of a fellow has helped you a bit too plentifully this time.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tink.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(who has been wiping the grease off)</stage> Oh, never mind, accidents will happen in

   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p> Or the worst—as mine is at present. You clumsy blockhead, go and get some more..</p>
    <stage>(Simon runs out, c., having picked up cutlets with his fingers, and put them on
     dish)</stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p>Don’t lose your temper, papa; it’s really most annoying. I do hope, Mr. Tinkler, your clothes
     are not damaged.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tink.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, not at all. <stage>(aside)</stage> My last new guinea’s worth spoilt. <stage>(intimating

    <p> Mr. Tinkler, you have chosen the right gal; she’s a bit skittish, but there’s none of your

    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>Of course you are, because you ain’t in Maggie’s place. When you have got rid of your fine

   <sp>
    <speaker>Glubb.</speaker>
    <p>That he was in love with one of you, but he wasn’t. For the future, remember an old proverb,
