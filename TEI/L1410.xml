     <head>SCENE I.—Chambers of Scrooge, the Miser. One side of it is filled up with a desk and high
      stool, the other is a fireplace, fire lighted. Easy chair table, with candlestick upon it,
      etc., etc.</head>
     <stage>Scrooge, the Miser, discovered near fire. Bob Cratchit, writing near desk, L. H. As the
      Curtain rises he descends from stool—approaches fire to stir it.</stage>
     <sp who="#L1410_M1">
      <speaker>Scrooge.</speaker>
      <p>Bob—Bob, we shall be obliged to part. You'll ruin me in coals!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1410_M5">
      <speaker>Bob.</speaker>
      <p>Ruin you—with such a fire in such weather! I've been trying to warm myself by the candle
       for the last half hour, but not being a man of strong imagination, failed.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1410_M1">

      <p>Hark! I think I hear some one in the office. Go—see who it is.</p>

      <p>Marley has been dead seven years, and has left me his sole executor—his sole
       administrator—his sole residuary legatee—his sole friend—his sole mourner! My poor old
       partner! I was sorely grieved at his death, and shall never forget his funeral. Coming from
       it, I made one of the best bargains I ever made. Ha, ha. Folks say I'm tight-
       <pb n="4"/>fisted—that I'm a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, clutching miser. What of that?
       It saves me from being annoyed by needy men and beggars. So, this is Christmas eve—and cold,
       bleak, biting weather it is, and folks are preparing to be merry. Bah! what's Christmas eve
       to me? what should it be to them?</p>

      <p>What else can I be, when I live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon
       Merry Christmas. What's Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money—a
       time for finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer. If I could work my will,
       every idiot who goes about with merry Christmas on his lips should be boiled with his own
       pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart—he should!</p>

      <p>There are many things from which I might have derived good by which I have not profited, I
       dare say, Christmas among the rest, but I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time,
       when it has come round, as a good time—a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only
       time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to
       open their shut up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were
       fellow passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys,
       and, therefore, uncle, though it has not put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I
       believe that it has done me good, and will do me good, and I say, Heaven bless it!</p>

      <p>I shall soon be home! Won't my Martha be glad to see me—and what a pleasant happy Christmas
       Day we shall spend. What a dinner we shall have! I've got fifteen shillings—my week's
       wages—and I'm determined to spend every farthing of it. Won't we have a prime goose, and a
       magnificent pudding! And then the gin and water—and oranges
       <pb n="14"/>—and the—oh, how jolly we shall be! And Tiny Tim, too—he never tasted goose
       before—how he will lick his dear little chops at the sage and onions! And as for Martha—my
       dear Martha, who is a dress-maker, and can only come to see us once in about four months—she
       shall have the parson's nose. Let me see—a goose will cost seven shillings—pudding
       five—that's twelve. Oranges, sage and onions, potatoes, and gin, at least three shillings
       more. Oh, there will be quite enough money, and some to spare. <stage>(During this speech Sam

       Are these the things of the shadows that will be, or are they the shadows of the things that
       may be only? <stage>(The Spirit still points downward to the grave.)</stage> Men's courses
       will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in they must lead—but if the courses be

       must have been but for this intercourse! why show me this if I am past all hope? <stage>(The

       me—assure me that I yet may change these shadows you have shown me, by an altered life!

       keep it all the year—I will live the past, the present, and the future—the spirits of all
       three shall strive within me—I will not shut out the lessons that they teach—oh tell me I may
