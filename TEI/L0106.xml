    <head>Prefatory Note.</head>
    <p>I had been often told by my literary friends, that the sentimental Comedies, so popular at
     the <hi>Gymnase Theatre</hi> in Paris, were unsuited to the taste of a London Public. In spite
     of this opinion, I wrote <title>The Prima Donna.</title> I think I may conscientiously say,
     that I offered it to every manager in London, by whom it was particularly admired, and returned
     to me with thanks. </p>
    <p>At last I induced Mr, Kean to allow me to read it to him; he accepted it at once, and
     pronounced his faith in its success: (although I must do him the justice to say I read him to
     sleep).</p>
    <p>The question, then, is settled, and the London Public will accept this class of Drama; and
     what is more, we have artists who can render it with spirit and finesse-</p>
    <p>Some six months ago, I went to the Soho Theatre to witness some Amateur Theatricals. I saw
     there a young lady, in whose performance I detected so much excellence, that I told her so. I
     gave the same opinion to Mr. Kean, who having satisfied himself that I was right, instantly
     engaged her; and any reader who may wish to share this opinion may do so, as this lady, Miss
     Heath, made her debut in <title>The Prima Donna.</title></p>
    <p>On the character of Margaret in this piece, I had lavished all my care: there was at once my
     only hope and only fear, the character was dangerous and difficult. It was realized by Miss
     Robertson, with so deep a sense of its tenderness, with so much elegance and poetry, that I
     congratulated myself that every manager in London had refused the Comedy, since to that fact I
     owe the admiration bestowed on her performance. </p>

    <p>My earliest recollections picture a poor, famished, ragged child, begging her bread from
      house to house; singing our Swiss melodies to gain a breakfast. It was on my journey from a
      neighbouring mountain village to this town that I was overtaken by a snowstorm, in which I had
      perished, but for timely assistance. I was carried to this house—a fever ensued and ere I
      recovered, I was the adopted child of my preserver—the companion of his only daughter.</p>

    <p>My benefactor was a physician; but the income he derived from his patients he spent in
      medicines for the poor—he was verging on ruin, when a means of escape from that calamity
      suggested itself—my voice, hitherto valued only as a solace to my father, I reflected that it
      might save us.  In a word, I quitted this house as I entered it— on foot.  I walked to Milan
      where under the name of Stella, I appeared at the Scala, you know the rest.</p>

    <p>I cannot tell ; but about three months ago, a rich English patient of mine, Mrs. Dacre, who
      remained here under my care, took a great liking to Margaret, and on leaving us invited her to
      accompany their party to Como: the idea pleased my child, and she left me. After a months
      absence she returned—</p>

    <p>Yes—but changed ; and from that hour I saw my poor child yielding slowly to some fearful
      invisible malady—without pain, with a smile always on her livid lip. You appeal to my
      skill—well ! I flew to it—and—do you know its value ? It endowed me with the anguish of
      watching my beautiful, my adored, my only one, wither under my very eyes! It enabled me to
      calculate the hours of her fleeting life with terrible exactitude.</p>

    <p>None. When she awakes from the stupor in which my art has plunged her, she will exhibit every
      sign of health, except strength ; she will thank heaven for her happiness—and then—she will
      leave us !</p>

    <p>We were staying is a large hotel, built on the very verge of the lovely lake. One night,
     after we had retired to rest, I was roused from sleep by a dreadful sensation of oppression,
     the room was filled with a dense smoke—confused cries, mingled with the roar of flame,
     bewildered my senses. I flew to the window and shrieked for help—I remember the look of the
     upturned faces of the mob—presently I distinguished an Austrian officer rush from the crowd and
     plunge into the sea of flame—my senses fled. When I awoke, I found myself in the arms of this
     stranger—he had saved my life. My first sensation was one of shame—so burning, so bitter, that
     I almost hated him. The next day he visited Mrs. Dacre; how I received him I cannot tell; he
