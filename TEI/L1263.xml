     lounging on sofa reading. (L.)</stage>

    <sp who="#L1263_M2">
     <speaker>Har.</speaker>
     <p>Ethel, my dear girl, I'd stand a great deal from you that I wouldn't stand from any one
      else, but there's a limit to one's endurance even of musical torture. I've stood Verdi and
      Offenbach with the constancy of an early martyr—but Beethoven—oh, hang it, I draw the line
      long before I get to Beethoven.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_F7">
     <speaker>Ethel.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (leaving the piano)</stage>My music did not bore you once, Harold.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M2">
     <speaker>Har.</speaker>
     <p>Of course it didn't. You see, one don't begin by being bored. The word is an expressive one,
      implying a slow, gradual process, possibly very agreeable in its earlier stages, but
      degenerating, as it goes on, into an intolerable nuisance.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_F7">
     <speaker>Ethel.</speaker>
     <p>Gentlemanly! <stage>(comes down and sits R.)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M2">
     <speaker>Har.</speaker>
     <p>Besides, in the remote period you delicately indicate by the word “once,” not only was I
      foolishly in love with you, but (what is more to the point) that tinkling old box of music was
      an uncommonly decent cottage piano. When I fondly adored you, it was my duty to fondly adore
      your music also. But now that James Casby holds my commission, you must look to him for an
      efficient discharge of the duties attached to the office. I can't undertake the drudgery of an
      adorer, unless I'm permitted to benefit by the emoluments. In a month, James Casby will be
      your   husband. If you want to play to him, take my advice and do so before the month is
      up.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_F7">
     <speaker>Ethel.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (quietly.)</stage>Harold, you must speak with more respect of Mr. Casby—before me,
      at all events—if you do not wish us to quarrel.</p>
    </sp>
    <pb n="4"/>
    <sp who="#L1263_M2">
     <speaker>Har.</speaker>
     <p>My dear cousin, I don't want to say one word against James Casby as James Casby. Taken by
      himself, as a wealthy Bombay merchant, and setting his contemplated relationship with the
      family out of the question, I have no objection to James Casby. I think I could even endure
      James Casby. I will even go so far as to conceive a state of things under which I could almost
      like James Casby. You think me an enthusiast, I know; <hi>c'est comme cela que je suis
       fait</hi>. But looking upon him in the special capacity of my cousin Ethel's husband—viewing
      him through the trying medium of a contemplated relationship —I am forced reluctantly to the
      conclusion, that James Casby is—not to put too fine a point upon it—a failure. He's not worthy
      of you, Ethel. He's a straightforward fellow enough, I dare say, but in the matter of tact and
      gentlemanly culture, he's nowhere. He's the sort of fellow who, if he were dining with Barclay
      and Perkins, would call for beer.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_F7">
     <speaker>Ethel.</speaker>
     <p>Harold, I am sure that we—that is, that you— do not understand him.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M2">
     <speaker>Har.</speaker>
     <p>  I understand this at all events: that he owes every penny he possesses, his social
      position, his friends, the very clothes he wears (not that they are worth much) to my
      unfortunate governor, and that, wealthy man as he is, he repays the debt with a sulky
      close-fisted indifference at the very moment when open-handedness on his part would be the
      most acceptable attitude he could assume. I understand this: that the only way in which he
      will consent to help his benefactor out of his pecuniary difficulties, is by marrying his
      niece, my old flame, Ethel. There's no nonsense about family pride in me, but, hang it all,
      it's a mortifying thing when a fellow whose great grandfather sat in the Peers, is cut out by
      a fellow whose mother died in a ditch!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_F7">
     <speaker>Ethel.</speaker>
     <p>Well, for a man of your keen sense of injury, you appeared to submit that mortification
      pretty patiently.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M2">
     <speaker>Har.</speaker>
     <p>Yes. Perhaps I didn't feel it as acutely as I should. The right thing would have been to
      have got him over to Calais—shot him—come back—married you, and spent the remainder of my
      existence in dodging Mr. Pollaky and the Scotland Yard police authorities. The wrong thing was
      to grin and bear it. I chose the wrong thing; I generally do. It gave less trouble; it
      generally does.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_F7">
     <speaker>Ethel.</speaker>
     <p>Harold, let us come to a distinct understanding,   Once I loved you very dearly; it would be
      ridiculous on my part to deny it; you have had many, too many proofs of it. <pb n="5"/>You won
      my love too easily, and when it had served to amuse you for a few weeks, you treated it as men
      generally treat a love they have had no difficulty in gaining, and which they have little fear
      of losing, and I accepted my position with complaint. My uncle's heavy losses— losses that
      threatened immediate bankruptcy—induced me then to accept Mr. Casby. I don't pretend that I
      love him as I once loved you, but I know him to be a good, upright, and honourable man, and if
      you dare to breathe another word to his disparagement, we are strangers from that moment.
       <stage>(rising and crossing to Harold.)</stage> Don't be angry with me, dear Harold, but you
      must see how difficult my position is, and how that difficulty is enhanced by the contemptuous
      tone you adopt in speaking of him.</p>

      it; I forgive you! <stage>(kisses her)</stage> Hallo, here he comes.</p>

     <p><stage> (indifferently)</stage>Have you?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M3">
     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p>Yes. It's not a big one, but it will answer our purpose until we start for Bombay. My little
      Ethel! Do you know, I often wonder how it is that we happen to be thrown together as we are! I
      am a rough, ready-made <pb n="6"/>man of business of eight and forty—you are a young girl of
      eighteen. You are in the hey-day of the age of romance —I have long been consigned to the
      limbo of dull prosaic reality—Now, by every rule of romance, if not of common   sense, you
      should marry a young man—a young fellow of two and twenty or thereabouts—penniless, but
      attractive —a strapping young fellow, with his way to make, and only you to help him make it,
      and not a dull matter-of-fact man of business, whose fortune has long been made—whose lot in
      life is a common-place certainty. Eh, Ethel?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_F7">
     <speaker>Ethel.</speaker>
     <p>You pay yourself a very poor compliment.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M3">
     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, I don't know that. It's not such a bad compliment from my point of view.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_F7">
     <speaker>Ethel.</speaker>
     <p>It's a very poor one from mine.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M3">
     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p>Ah, you'll come to look at it from my stand-point one of these days.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_F7">
     <speaker>Ethel.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, when I am your age, perhaps.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M3">
     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (sits down.)</stage>My schooling, you see, has been an exceptional one. At the age
      of ten, when I first began to sweep out Bounderby's office—a very small office, then, in
      Thames Street—the position of a junior clerk in that house appeared to me the very summit of
      human ambition. When, after five years' sweeping, I was made a junior clerk, I could conceive
      no dignity equal to that of senior clerk—until I became a senior clerk, when partnership in
      all its full glory opened out before me, and I fell down and worshipped it. Promotion in the
      house of Bounderby has been the be-all and the end-all of my existence. I have achieved my
      highest ambition: I have risen from nothing, to be the sole   representative of a leading
      Bombay house—for Bounderby's has taken enormous strides since I swept it out—and when I, who
      was once an office lad, and before that, a beggar-boy, describe myself as a prosaic
      matter-of-fact Bombay merchant, I don't think the compliment is such a bad one, after all!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_F7">
     <speaker>Ethel.</speaker>
     <p>Of course it is infinitely to your credit that you rose as you did. I did not mean that you
      success is not a thing to be proud of. I meant that in instituting a comparison between
      yourself and a younger man to your own disadvantage, you do yourself—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M3">
     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p>An injustice? No, Ethel; I know the full value of the sacrifice you are making for me, and
      I'm at an age when impressions of this kind don't readily fade. I know that you are going to
      give up house, home, relations, friends, country, everything for me. I know that you are going
      to leave all you love in England to spend a half-barbarous life with me in another world. It
      will be a great change for <pb n="7"/> you, Ethel. A new country, a new climate, new friends,
      new associations. So much that is new to learn—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_F7">
     <speaker>Ethel.</speaker>
     <p>Yes. And so much that is old to forget. <stage>(rises.)</stage></p>

     <p> (L.)Yes, Mrs. Pike, as you say, vicissitudes make us acquainted with strange bed-fellows.
      Who'd have thought that a respectable man-servant like me would ever have come down to be a
      Gray's Inn clerk! It's a fall— ma'am—a fall!</p>

     <speaker>Flathers.</speaker>
     <p>No—at all events I'm getting over it now. But when the colonel's establishment was broke up
      through his being quodded along of Mr. Parkle's claims, I was turned adrift without so much as
      a character to my back. Who'd go to Cursitor Street for a servant's character, don't you see?
      So says I, “I'll look up Mr. Harold, who's always treated me civil,” and after a time he took
      me on as his clerk, which in Gray's Inn means everything but a clerk.</p>

     <p>I'm sure you don't, Mrs. Pike. Lord, you should have seen him when he first come here a year
      ago. He was on the attic floor then, and a pound o' beef sausages lasted him four days. His
      boots was in such rags, ma'am, as they couldn't call their soles their own. This

     <p>  No, thank yer. That was before they started “The Weekly Tormentor;” Lord, what a
      difference that made, all at once. He come down from the attic to the second floor at one
      jump—and engaged a clerk all at once, like a lord. If he hadn't been down on his back six
      weeks with scarlet fever, he'd been on the first pair by this time.</p>

    <sp who="#L1263_F9">
     <speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
     <p>Ah, he was dreadful bad, surely! It was a bad business for all of us. He hadn't so much as a

     <speaker>Flathers.</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. P., the Benchers are deaf, dumb, and blind on all questions of morality, except one—the
      punctual payment of the quarter's rent. But if they was peacocks, the more they saw of Mary
      Waters the more highly they'd respect her. She nussed Mr. Calthorpe through a six weeks'
      fever, like a beauty; never leavin' of him night and <pb n="21"/> day except to take her
      meals. This here arm cheer deserves to be framed and glazed ever since she paid it the
      compliment of sleepin' in it. And if Mr. Calthorpe is a brick—and he ain't a bad sort, mind
      yer—he'll marry her right off as soon as he's strong again. And if he don't I will.

     <p>Oh! But in your unfavourable criticism on Mr. Cribb's Comedy—here it is—you say, “It is not
      to the point that the piece was badly played. The talent of an accomplished dramatist is shown
      in his power of rising superior to the insignificant accident of an incompetent company.”</p>

     <p>Ha! Yes. You see that's Cribb's piece. You don't understand these things. I am the editor of
      a satirical journal, and a new piece is played. Very good. Remember it is a satirical journal
      and its power of satire must be <pb n="24"/> allowed full play. If the company is good I abuse
      the piece; if the piece is good I abuse the company. I've no alternative.</p>

      that he fed you, clothed you, and educated you for twenty years, and that perhaps he is hardly

     <p>But it was an appointment—an appointment, Flathers. His Lordship made it himself.</p>

     <speaker>Flathers.</speaker>
     <p>I think there must be some mistake, sir, as his Lordship and Miss Barrington are at the

     <p>Dear me! My appointment with his Lordship was for four. Damn these mushroom swells! The

     <speaker>Flathers.</speaker>
     <p>No, sir, I won't. I never would. The temptation has been great, but I've always resisted it.
      I once knew a party, sir, who was a fool, and very much respected he was in that line of
      business, and a very good thing he made of it, too. He was such a fool, sir, that he once
      found two bills—one for £3,500 and one for £5,000 <stage>(Parkle starts)</stage>, drawn, sir,
      and accepted by two names, as shall be nameless, and would you believe it, sir, he took 'em
      both to the acceptor instead of the drawer! The fool got a hundred for his trouble, sir!</p>

     <p><stage> (aside)</stage>Now or never! <stage>(aloud)</stage> Mr. Casby, eighteen months ago I

    <sp who="#L1263_M3">
     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p>Oh! no you won't. You are much too good a   lawyer to take steps in a matter of this kind
      until your chain of evidence is complete. You've got to trace them to my possession, you know,
      and if Lord Ovington learns that you've lost the bills before you're in a position to prove
      where they may be found, he will simply repudiate them, and where will you be then?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M4">
     <speaker>Parkle.</speaker>
     <p>By to-morrow or the next day at latest, I shall be in a position to prove that. And before I
      go, let me give you my opinion of your conduct in this matter.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M3">
     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, Mr. Parkle, don't give yourself that trouble. I know what you are going to say: I was
      always an ungrateful scoundrel, and an unscrupulous liar, but you had no idea until to-day
      that I was also an accomplished swindler. Charges of this kind don't affect me at all: you
      see, I've been birched so often with the same broom in the course of the last twelvemonths
      that my skin has become callous. But with respect to your tracing the bills to me, let me tell
      you this as a friend—to-morrow or next day will be too late. Unless you can make it evident
      that those bills are in my possession within the next half-hour, you may spare yourself the
      trouble of doing so at all.</p>

    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M1">

    <sp who="#L1263_M3">
     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p>Lord Ovington, I want to speak to you on a matter that intimately concerns the curious
      relations that have existed between us for many years past. In three weeks I marry your niece,
      Ethel, and it is fit that what I have to say should be said before that event takes place.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M1">
     <speaker>Lord O.</speaker>
     <p>Well, really, Mr. Casby, now that you have <pb n="32"/> broached the topic of your
      approaching marriage with my niece, you must forgive my saying that it has always appeared to
      me extraordinary that a man of your professed delicacy should take advantage of a fact that
      Ethel is bound by a sense of honour to fulfil a promise that, in short—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M3">
     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (amazed)</stage>What do you mean?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M1">
     <speaker>Lord O.</speaker>
     <p>I mean, of course, that neither you nor I can be blind to the fact that Ethel—in short—that
      she is not— that she can never, in fact—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M3">
     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (seizing his arm)</stage>  Speak out, man, in heaven's name.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M1">
     <speaker>Lord O.</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Casby, you forget yourself. Be good enough, if you please, to remember that you are not
      addressing one of your clerks.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M3">
     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (excitedly)</stage>Lord Ovington, don't mince words with me. Speak openly and
      plainly. I am not a man to be trifled with, and I'll get your meaning from you if I have to
      choke it out. What do you mean, man? <stage>(holding him down in chair.)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M1">
     <speaker>Lord O.</speaker>
     <p>I mean that Ethel is wholly insensible to the advantage of an alliance with you. I mean that
      you are thrown away upon her. I mean that she don't appreciate you. I mean that she so
      misinterprets your conduct to me that she looks upon you as an incarnation of brutal
      ingratitude. I mean that if you offered to release her from her engagement, she would go mad
      with happiness. That's what I mean. <stage>(shaking Casby off.)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M3">
     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (with forced calmness)</stage>Lord Ovington, it may be as you say. I don't know. I
      can't quite realize it yet— you say that I cannot be blind to the fact that Ethel does not
      love me. If it is a fact, I <hi>have</hi> been blind to it. It has never occurred to me to
      doubt her love.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M1">
     <speaker>Lord O.</speaker>
     <p>Come, Mr. Casby; I have put it harshly to you, but it was better to be open and above board.
      Think the matter over. It is for you to consider whether you will   take advantage of the fact
      that she has entered into an engagement with you under pressure, and that she is only actuated
      by a sense of honour in adhering to the terms of it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M3">
     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p>It is a question that requires no consideration. If it is as you say—and what you have said
      has thrown a new light on many incidents in her demeanour towards me, my course is clear. It
      is my duty to release her, and I will do my duty.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M1">
     <speaker>Lord O.</speaker>
     <p>Bravely said. Believe me, I have not spoken without authority. Why, remember how coldly, how
      formally she speaks to you. Contrast her affectionate behaviour <pb n="33"/> to me, her
      uncle—even to Harold, her cousin—with her behaviour to you whom she is about to marry.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M3">

    <sp who="#L1263_M1">
     <speaker>Lord O.</speaker>
     <p>Come; I will send her to you, and you shall sound her. I hope—I sincerely hope—I may have
      been mistaken, but I am afraid that is hoping against hope. With respect to the business
      matter on which you wished to see me—why another time will do for that. When you are
      calmer—when <stage>(with affected emotion)</stage> when we are both

     <p><stage> (on sofa)</stage>Yes. It's true enough. I feel that. Oh, Ethel, Ethel, I never
      doubted <hi>you</hi>! I know at what value this London world prizes men of my uncouth stamp,

    <sp who="#L1263_M3">

     <p><stage> (half alarmed)</stage>Yes.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M3">
     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p>Ethel, in three weeks we are to be married.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_F7">
     <speaker>Ethel.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, in three weeks.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M3">
     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p>In three weeks, Ethel, we are to be made one. In three weeks we are to have but one mind,
      one purpose, one existence. We are to live for each other, and in each other. We are to devote
      ourselves wholly, solely, and utterly to the other's happiness. <stage>(sits)</stage> This is
      to last for life. Ethel, marriage is our first death, and as we are prepared to meet it, so
      shall we awake to a life of inexpressible happiness or of inexpressible sorrow.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_F7">
     <speaker>Ethel.</speaker>
     <p>Your metaphor is a very gloomy one, Mr. Casby. Compare it rather to a second birth. We are
      born, by marriage into a new existence, with new associations. We are still at the world's
      mercy, and may sink or swim as it pleases.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M3">
     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p>No. There are accidents of birth, but there are no accidents of marriage. A man who rashly
      enters into that solemn bond, does so with his eyes open to the consequences, and he must hold
      himself responsible for them, whatever they may be. A husband and wife are not at the world's
      mercy, Ethel; they are at the mercy of each other,   and Heaven help them if that mercy is
      found wanting.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_F7">
     <speaker>Ethel.</speaker>
     <p>Amen!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M3">
     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p>I'm a rough commonplace fellow, Ethel, but my career has been an exceptional one. The
      accident of my singing under your uncle's window one cold December day, thirty years ago,
      determined the whole tenour of my life. <pb n="34"/> That accident, and its singular
      consequences, have taught me to set a higher value on the importance of the turning-points of
      life—to look more earnestly, more solemnly into the future than men of the world commonly
      do.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_F7">
     <speaker>Ethel.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, I am aware, Mr. Casby, that you are always ready to bring your valuable mercantile
      experiences to bear upon every action of your life. But I think you overrate your tendency to
      weigh the value of your actions. I have found that gentlemen of your calling are accustomed to
      balance probabilities, and keep a debtor and creditor account with Fate.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M3">
     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p>You speak lightly, but your words are not the echo of your heart—you feel as I feel, you

      essential to married happiness? You are a young girl; I am a middle-aged man; you are
      impulsive, impassioned; I am a hard, stern man of business; your associations are English,
      mine are Indian. You twitted me just now with my mercantile way of looking at things; look at
      this engagement of ours from a mercantile point of view; you have youth on your side; I have

      six months ago for Ovington Grange, and I have never seen him since. I have been true to him,

      through the long dreary days and the cold black nights, through a long, long illness that
      nearly killed me; through my slow recovery— even through the knowledge that he was on the
      point of being married to you. I loved him in my quiet simple way as <pb n="37"/>dearly, as

     <speaker>Lord O.</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Casby, this is painful to me. This is extremely painful. Let the matter rest. You force
      me to say that which I would willingly have left unsaid. You force me to say that your conduct
      towards me has rendered it impossible for me to enter into any further transactions with you.
      I cannot recognise your existence. I would prefer to think that you and your surroundings had
      utterly passed away. <stage>(rises and crosses to sofa, L.)</stage></p>

     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p>No doubt. Still you must hear what I have to say. Eighteen months ago, when you proposed to
      borrow £2,000 of me, I told you that, although I considered that £2,000 by no means
      represented the full extent of the debt I owed you, I did not intend to pay it by advancing
      you that sum. I am here to discharge that debt in my own fashion.</p>

     <p>I have no wish, sir, to magnify the exceptional obligations you are under to me, but I must

    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1263_M3">
     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p>When you took me from the streets, Lord Ovington, thirty years ago, you were courting the
      wealthy but weak impressionable lady you eventually married. You were under a cloud just then.
      Your character was not a particularly good one. You had just been tried by court-martial   for
      several brutal acts of tyranny over the men of your company, and although you had been
      acquitted, the admitted evidence against you was of a character that damaged you in the eyes
      of your private friends, though it did not suffice to convict you of the cruelties laid to
      your charge. To reinstate yourself in the eyes of your friends, and particularly in the eyes
      of the weak, worthy lady you hoped to marry, you took me from the streets, one winter morning;
      you clothed me, you fed me, and you sent me to a day school, in order that I might pick up the
      rudiments of an education which would fit me to fight my own way in the battle of life. By
      this simple act of charity, which you took care to exploit, you succeeded in rehabilitating
      your character in her eyes, and you married her. It cost you a twenty-pound note, and it
      brought you in twenty thousand pounds.</p>

     <p>True. Thank you for that admission. As you say, I owed them a grudge. I disliked Bounderby,
      but did   I allow that consideration to stop me when I had an opportunity of doing him a
      material service? No. I gave you to him, nevertheless.</p>

      employers, and passed through the various subordinate grades until James Casby, the ex-beggar

      to your belief. If I had really been influenced by the contemptible motives you attribute to

    <sp who="#L1263_M3">
     <speaker>Casby.</speaker>
     <p>Stop—hear me out! Lord Ovington, notwithstanding the debt I owe you, I have never liked you.
      I   don't know anyone who ever did. The fact that you took me from the streets simply to serve
      your own private ends; that the good you intended to do me is infinitesimal compared with the
      good that you have actually done me, are facts that, to my thinking, don't at all affect the
      debt I owe you. My obligations to you have been constantly before my eyes, and at each
      successive increase of fortune I have winced to think that my good fortune came to me saddled
      with the curse of an increased obligation to such a scoundrel as you. But I knew—I felt—that
      sooner or later my turn would come. I did not know how—I did not care how— but I knew it would
      come. At length, after a weary <pb n="41"/> waiting, it came! Eighteen months ago a bill for
      £3,500, purporting to have been drawn by you, and accepted by me, came into my London agent's
      hands. He saw at once that the bill was a forgery, but he said nothing to that effect. He
      rewarded the bringer and sent it out to me. Armed with the document, I came to England to
      avenge on you the agony of mind that the sense of my debt to you had occasioned me for so many
      years. On my arrival, I learnt that a second bill, for £5,000, bearing the same names, had
      crossed me on my way home, so, to make my revenge complete, I determined to wait until it
      reached my hands. Owing to a series of delays which I need not now detail, that bill reached
      me only three weeks ago. <stage>(Producing bills).</stage></p>

      many years to come. Oblige me by supposing, if you please, that I have exercised that
