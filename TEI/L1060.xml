       you ; young— full of talent—what I was thirty years ago;—I'm old now, and not full of talent,

      <p>This'll do.</p>

      <p><stage>(L. of table)</stage> Then I'll begin,—first let me introduce Mr. Sidney Daryl, to
       Mr. John Chodd of Snoggerston, also to Mr. John Chodd, Jun., of the same place; Mr. John
       Chodd of Snoggerston is very rich;—he made a fortune by —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Chodd, Sen.</speaker>
      <p>No !—my brother Joe made the fortune in Australey, by gold digging and then spec'lating;
       which he then died, and left all to me.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Chodd, Jun.</speaker>
      <p><stage>(aside)</stage> Guv ! cut it!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Chodd, Sen.</speaker>
      <p>I shant,—I ain't ashamed of what I was, nor what I am ;—it never was my way. Well, sir, I
       have lots of brass !</p>

      <p>Brass?</p>

      <p>Money?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Chodd, Jun.</speaker>
      <p>Heaps!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Chodd, Sen.</speaker>
      <p><stage>(L. C. )</stage> Heaps; but having begun by being a poor man, without edication, and
       not being a gentleman :</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Chodd, Jun.</speaker>
      <p><stage>(aside)</stage> Guv!—cut it.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Chodd, Sen.</speaker>
      <p>I shan't—I know I'm not, and I'm proud of it, that is proud of knowing I'm not, and I won't
       pretend to be. Johnny, don't put me out—I say I'm not a gentleman, but my son is.</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Chodd, Sen.</speaker>
      <p>And I wish him to cut a figure in the world—to get into Parliament.</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Sidney.</speaker>
      <p>Very difficult.</p>

      <speaker>Chodd, Sen.</speaker>
      <p>And in short, to be a—a real gentleman.</p>

      <p>Just so, and as I have lots of capital unemployed, I mean to invest it in —</p>

      <p><stage>(slapping Sidney on knees)</stage> A new daily paper ?</p>

      <p>By Jove!</p>

      <p><stage>(delighted)</stage> That's it—that's it, only it looks better in print.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
      <p><stage>(spouting)</stage> Bring the glad and solemn tidings of the day to the labourer at
       his plough—the spinner at his wheel—the swart forger at his furnace—the sailor, on the giddy
       mast—the lighthouse keeper, as he trims his beacon lamp—the housewife, at her paste-board—the
       mother at her needle—the lowly lucifer seller, as he plashes his wet and weary way through
       the damp, steaming, stony streets, eh ?—you know, <stage>(slapping Sidney Daryl on the
       knee—they both laugh)</stage></p>

      <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
      <p>So my old friend, Johnny Prothero, who lives hard by Mr. Chodd, knowing that I have started
       lots of papers, sent the two Mr. Chodds, or the Messrs. Chodd— which is it ? you're a great
       grammarian—to me. I can find them an efficient staff, and you are the first man we've called
       upon.</p>

      <p><stage>(kissing her)</stage> My darling. How d'ye do, Mr. Churton. I've got a waggon, and a

       Chodd, I cannot entertain your very commercial proposition. My friends, are my friends; they
       are not marketable commodities. I regret that I can be of no assistance to you. With your
       appearance, manners, and cheque book, you are sure to make a circle of your own.</p>

      <p>You two fools have been making love. I've long suspected it. I'm shocked with both of you;

       and bread and cheese? Or do you <stage>(to Maud)</stage> wish to marry a shabby writer, who

       yourselves, <stage>(to Maud)</stage> To keep appointments in a public square ! your conduct
       is disgraceful—worse— it is unladylike ; and yours <stage>(to Sidney)</stage>, is

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
      <p>Yes; one of the finest classical scholars in the world ; might have sat upon the woolsack
       if he'd chosen but he didn't. <stage>(O'Sullivan is now tossing with Mac Usquebaugh)</stage>
       That is the famous Desmond Mac Usquebaugh, late M.P. for Killcrackskullcoddy, county Galway,
       a great patriot and orator; might have been Chancellor of the Exchequer if he'd chosen, but
       he didn't. <stage>(Scargil reaches to the gas light to light his pipe)</stage> That's Bill
       Bradley, <stage>(pointing to Bradley, who is reading paper with double eye-glass)</stage>
       author of the famous romance of "Time and Opportunity;" ran through ten editions. He got two
       thousand pounds for it, which was his ruin.</p>
     </sp>

      <p>How was he ruined by getting two thousand pounds?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
      <p>He's never done anything since. We call him "one book Bradley." That gentleman fast asleep—
       <stage>(looking towards author at table, L.)</stage> has made the fortune of three
       publishers, and the buttoned-up one with the shirt front of beard is Herr Makvicz, the great
       United German. Dr. Scargil, there, discovered the mensuration of the motive power of the

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
      <p>Sam Shamheart, the professional philanthropist. He makes it his business and profit to love
       the whole human race. <stage>(Shamheart puffs a huge cloud of smoke from his pipe)</stage>
       Smoke, sir; all smoke. A superficial observer would consider him only a pleasant oily humbug,
       but I, having known him two and twenty years, feel qualified to pronounce him one of the
       biggest villains untransported.</p>

      <p>And that man asleep at the end of the table ?</p>

      <p>I never heard of him.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
      <p>Nor anybody else. But he's a confirmed tippler, and here we consider drunkenness an
       infallible sign of genius—we make that a rule.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Chodd, Jun.</speaker>
      <p>But if they are all such great men, why didn't they make money by their talents?</p>

      <p>The M.E.—that is, the "Morning Earthquake" shakes the world for the first time to-morrow
       morning, and everything seems to have gone wrong with it. It is a crude unmanageable
       ill-disciplined, ill-regulated earthquake— Heave the first—Old Chodd behaves badly to me
       :—after organizing him a first-rate earthquake, engaging him a brilliant staff, and stunning
       reporters, he doesn't even offer me the post of sub-editor—ungrateful old humbug ! Heave the
       second:—no sooner is he engaged than our editor is laid up with the gout—and then old Chodd
       asks me to be a literary warming pan, and keep his place hot, till colchicum<note type="ed">Treatment for gout derived from the autumn crocus</note> and cold water have done their
       work—I'll be even with old Chodd though ! I'll teach him what it is to insult a man who has

       draughts—a sort of whining beggar, continually moved on by the maternal police—but 'tis a

       heir to, particularly when

       emanation. But the lady united herself to another, which was a very good thing for me, and

       Runnington-cum- Wapshot—where the yellow corn waved, our young loves ripened, and the new

      <p>Thank you, Lady Ptarmigant. for calling me by my name ; it reminds me who I am, and of my
       dead father, "Indian Hetherington," as he was called. It reminds me that the protection you
       have offered to his orphan daughter has been hourly embittered by the dreadful temper, which
       is an equal affliction to you as to those within your reach. It reminds me that the daughter
       of such a father should not stoop to a mesalliance, <stage>(crossing to L.)</stage></p>

      <p>Lady Ptarmigant, you forget yourself; and you are untruthful. Mr. Daryl is a gentleman by

      <speaker>Maud.</speaker>
      <p>He has dared to doubt me, and I have done with him for ever. From the moment he presumed to

      <p>Two days before he sailed for the Crimea, he called at my chambers, and told me that he
       felt convinced he should never return. He told me too of his connection with a poor and
       humble girl, who would shortly become the mother of his child. I saw from his face that the
       bullet was cast that would destroy him, and I begged him to legitimatize one, who, though of
       his blood, might not bear his name. Like a brave fellow, a true gentleman, on the next day he
       married.</p>
