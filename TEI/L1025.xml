       one, and they can pop in and out whenever they likes. There was a gentleman here some time

     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1025_F4">
      <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
      <p>Well, Jane, here we are safe at Meurice's, under the same roof with my runaway lover.
       Little does he think I am so near him; little does he imagine that the woman he left in
       England, disconsolate at his absence, has had spirit enough to follow him to Paris, to
       endeavour to prove the sincerity of his love by being an unseen observer of all his
       actions.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1025_F9">
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <p>Ah, miss, I wish you had taken my advice, and remained at home. If you had married Mr.
       Wyndham without a character from his last place, you might have been happy; but now, if after
       following him all the way from London, you should find him out in any naughty doings, you'll
       never have him, and we shall be obliged to return just as we came. Oh, it's quite shocking to
       think of it.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1025_F4">
      <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
      <p>Nay, Jane, I am resolved. I will see Wyndham when he least expects it. I think I possess
       his heart—but then he is so gay—so volatile—so fond of pleasure, and so easily captivated by
       a pretty face, that I sometimes doubt the sincerity
       <pb n="4"/> of his affection. His departure, too, for Paris, had something very sudden and
       mysterious about it. I am determined to find out his motive for leaving me on the very eve of
       our marriage; I'll assume disguises and watch him narrowly. If I find him unfaithful I'll
       return to England and never see him more; but if he is constant and worthy of my love he will
       be doubly dear to me, and I will return his wife.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1025_F9">
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <p>Well, miss, you know best—but I am very duberous; the men are such devils, there's no
       trusting any of them—to one's face they are so loving, so good, and so tender—but when they
       are out of sight, oh dear! they are shocking creatures—quite Blue Beards, miss.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1025_F4">
      <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
      <p>Why, Jane, you appear to have a very bad opinion of mankind!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1025_F9">
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <p>Ah, miss, but not without cause—I've been crossed in love so often—nineteen times, miss—I
       have indeed. Now I've got a sort of a kind of a—a liking for Sam, Mr. Wyndham's own man, he's
       here in Paris with his master—and whilst you are looking after your lover, miss, I dare say I
       shall find my Sam at his tricks too; but if I do I'll tear his eyes out, an insinuating
       wretch—that's what I will.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1025_F4">
      <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
      <p>Ha, ha, ha! I hope you'll have no occasion to find fault with him. But let me prepare my
       plan; you must assist me. Get me my masquerade dresses, and be in readiness to second me in
       everything I may require. We have no time to lose—Wyndham will no doubt soon be here, and I
       shall make my first appearance to him without delay.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1025_F9">
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <p>What dress will you have first, miss?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1025_F4">
      <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
      <p>That I can't tell. I shall be guided by circumstances. Get everything ready, and take care
       that you are not seen by either Wyndham or Sam.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1025_F9">
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <p><stage>(going, R.)</stage> Yes, miss. Oh dear, I know how this will end—master and man will
       both be found out; I shall be crossed in love again, for the twentieth time, and perhaps die
       an old maid; but if I do, I'm a Dutchman. <stage>Exit, R. D.</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1025_F4">
      <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
      <p>Let me reflect on what I'm about to do; it is a bold hazard—my happiness or misery depends
       upon it. If I find him false I shall be most wretched; but if he pass the ordeal— if he be
       true, then what a happy, happy creature I shall be. Could every woman (like me) convince
       herself of her lover's real character and affection before marriage, how many unhappy unions
       would be avoided, and how many separations, elopements, divorces and broken hearts prevented.
       Let me hope for the best; Wyndham may be thoughtless and fond of pleasure, yet something
       tells me he loves me too well ever to give me real cause for uneasiness. <stage>(bell

      <p>A great deal, sir—because I'm obliged to make love to their pretty maids—and it's too much

      <p>Why, so I had, sir—but then your bad example, sir— I mean your <emph>good</emph> example;
       besides, one must be polite to the women—and you know what the French women are, sir—they
       require a great deal of politeness from us foreigners; it's very odd to be called a
       foreigner, isn't it, sir? If we don't make love to them, they call us bates, and ross-biffs,
       and biff-steaks and cochons, and all manner of names; so, sir, while you are making the
       amiable to the mistresses, I can't help being civil to the maids; it's quite natural,
       sir—it's quite necessaire. Now I look at Jane, sir, in this way: she's a very nice girl, and
       loves me, and I love her; she's like a fine sirloin of roast beef—a good substantial article;
       and these French women are like French dishes, all flummery. One soon gets tired of them, and
       returns with fresh appetite to the beef; you know what I mean, sir?</p>

      <p>I expect to hear from Emily. Poor creature! I dare say she is moping herself to death on my
       account. Rather too bad to leave her so suddenly—but couldn't help it. I thought I should
       like to have a frisk in Paris before I was tied up—and so here I have been for the last month
       at Meurice's and a fine rattling life I've had, what with the gaming-houses, play-houses,
       club-houses, balls, and parties, I've never had a moment to myself; and then the women, the
       dear delightful bewitching creatures, they too have contributed to make my time pass
       pleasantly. I've found out a new and expeditious method of learning French. Instead of
       conjugating verbs, and concocting sentences with an old prig of an Abbé or veteran
       schoolmaster! I make love to a pretty French woman, speak as much of her language as I can
       think of and when I am at a loss for words, make up the deficiencies with my eyes and lips.
       It's astonishing how well I get on, and how easily I make myself understood. I call it the
       kissological system.</p>

        <stage>(steps forward)</stage> Ladies, I address myself to you, because I know your
       influence over the men. In following my lover, and assuming disguises to turn him from his
       follies, and fix his wavering heart, have I done wrong? If you pronounce me guilty I must
       fall—but from your. pretty smiles and twinkling eyes, I trust your hands will feelingly
       acquit me. <stage>(curtseys)</stage> Gentlemen! married men and single men—you are too
       gallant to contradict the ladies, or pronounce them wrong, therefore I think I’m sure of you,
       and if you will condescend to appland our humble efforts to amuse you, uniting my five
       characters in one, permit me to wish you tenfold happiness. </p>
