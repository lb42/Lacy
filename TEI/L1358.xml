   <stage type="setting">Scene.—A well-furnished Apartment. Windows practicable, R. U. E. and L.
    U.E., through which are seen ladders standing against house ; doors, C. <stage>(to

    <l> " Ha, my dear boys, pray how d'ye do ? </l>
    <l>I hopes I sees you well. Perhaps ye don't know who I is— </l>
    <l>But I'm the Heastern swell. </l>
    <l> My chambers is in Shoreditch, </l>
    <l>And I fancies I'm a toff; </l>
    <l> From top to toe I really think </l>
    <l>I looks Immensikoff. </l>
    <l>Immensikoff," &amp;c.</l>
    <stage> During this song a postman's knock is heard, and Mary enters, C, with letter and papers
     which she lays on table. </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>Another dose of master's literary compositions come back; won't he be delighted! Serve him
     right, too; what does he want to go soiling his fingers with pen and ink for, when he has £500
     a-year of his own to do what he likes with ? Besides, among my set it isn't considered
     respectable.</p>

    <p>I'm not your dear, sir. You mustn't keep up that incessant howling or you'll drive master

    <p>That row you make with your mouth like buzzing through a comb—I should think not.</p>

    <p>But hang it, there's only me on the job, and I can't paint down the outsides of a terrace by

    <speaker>Slops.</speaker>
    <p> No I shan't; I just saw him getting it out himself— of the drawers.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
    <p>You're a stupid. I wish you'd take away some of the nasty ladders standing all round the
     house.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Slops.</speaker>
    <p>All right, I'll see after them, but I likes to do a little bit here and a little bit there
     just as it takes my fancy.</p>

     <stage>(listening)</stage>There he goes again ! He has been chanting that divine inspiration
     about four hours this morning, during which time he's painted the lid of a water-butt and about
     six inches of drain-pipe. <stage>(takes up letter)</stage>What's this ? Oh! a letter from
     Swidge, with my manuscript! <stage>(reads)</stage>" Dear Twittles,—1 have looked over your
     novel, and am much delighted with it. The scene between young Splotcher and his grandmother
     over the apple pudding—for a domestic scene—is perfection itself; but the work suffers from
     want of interest. If you want to startle people now-a-days, your first volume should end with
     an abduction, your second with a murder, and your last with a suicide. Can't you work these in
     ? but don't give us lay figures—make your characters flesh and blood.—Yours, Toppleton Swidge."
     That's <hi>his</hi> opinion. <stage>(opens packet)</stage>Wants incident, does it ?—then I must
     give 'em incident! I'll revise it at once. <stage>(takes pen)</stage>" Abduction !" " Murder !"

    <speaker>Slops.</speaker>
    <p>
     <stage>(outside)</stage>Only till dinner time. But, I say, don't you do that again ; you've
     given me a bump.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>Then, egad, he ought to be very much obliged to me, for I declare a phrenologist wouldn't
     give twopence ha'penny for his whole head. No matter.</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Slops.</speaker>
    <p>

     conjecture for a thing, and ten against, and you can cover the paper in no time.

    <stage> Enter Cockleshot, C. </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>There he is; I knew I wasn't mistaken. My dear Skinner, how do you do. <stage>(shakes

   </sp>

   </sp>
   <sp>

    <p> You don't mean to say you've forgotten me.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>Eh ? No, I haven't forgotten you, because I never knew you.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p> You think so,—then prove it.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>

    <p>Look here.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p> No, no, look here. <stage>(pointing to himself)</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>It's no use wasting time in useless argument.</p>

    <p>That'll do, that'll do, I'm—Shut your eyes and guess.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>I shan't do anything of the sort. I've heard of individuals telling you to shut your eyes and
     guess while they walk off with the furniture. It's a dodge to put you off your guard.</p>
   </sp>
   <pb n="6"/>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>Come, come, Skinner, no joking; you must guess, I won't go till you do.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>Will you go then ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p> Yes. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>
     <stage>(aside)</stage>I'd better humour him—it'll save time. Is it a common name ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>Affected ignorance ! Say shuttlecock backwards.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>This is too much; shuttlecock backwards, it can't be done. Shutt
     lecotts—cottleshucks—cockleshots.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>You've hit it.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>Which of 'em—which of the shots ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>Cockleshot; I knew you'd remember it. <stage>(shakes hands)</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>
     <stage>(aside)</stage>Perhaps I do know him after all. I wonder whether my name really is
     Skinner?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p> Do you know how I found you out ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p> No; I wish to goodness you <hi>had</hi> found me out.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>Here, don't stand—sit down and I'll tell you all about it. <stage>(takes easy chair and puts
      his legs up on another one, L. of table)</stage>Let's see—do you smoke? <stage>(sees cigar box
      on table)</stage>All right; these'll do. You'd better have one. <stage>(lights cigar)</stage>I
     was going to tell you how I found you out.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>
     <stage>(seated, R.)</stage>And I had just remarked.that I wish you had found me out.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>But I know you don't mean it. Just this—I was passing by on the opposite side of the
     street—heard an altercation with a painter—looked up—when I recognized your face. To cross over
     and knock at the door was the work of an instant; to vociferate Skinner to the charming Mary
     was a second; to ascend the staircase in spite of her remonstrance— a third ; and here I
     am.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>Or rather here you've been for the last quarter of an hour.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>The fact is, Skinner, after several years of foreign service in which I've been knocked about
     like a —— </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>Shuttlecock backwards.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>I returned to England only three months ago, so that the sight of a face I know is a perfect
     treat. But you, Skinner, of all friends in the world at this particular moment, do I most
     prize. <stage>(aside)</stage>How can I broach this difficult subject— house most convenient—
      <stage>(aloud)</stage>for I have a secret to confide in the recesses of your bosom, my
     boyhood's companion. <stage>(with effusion)</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>
     <stage>(very solemnly)</stage>Cockleshot, if ever I was a friend of your youth, I don't wish to
     know a morsel of your private affairs.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>My dear fellow, those are the very things which I <pb n="7"/>must confide in you.
      <stage>(aside)</stage>How to begin? <stage>(aloud)</stage>What are you doing there—scribbling?
      <stage>(takes up manuscript)</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>That, sir, is the manuscript of an original novel which I am now revising, and I'm just
     filling in a few sensational bits. <stage>(aside)</stage>By the bye, if this Cockleshot has led
     an active life, his experience might be of use. I say, Cockleshot, have you ever abducted
     anybody ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>
     <stage>(looks round)</stage>Hush ! <stage>(aside)</stage>How could he have hit on that—the very
     thing I was about to propose ? <stage>(aloud)</stage>No, but I don't care how soon I begin, if
     you'll only give me your assistance. Listen!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>I'm all ears.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>Hush! <stage>(whispers)</stage>I can see 'em. <stage>(rapidly)</stage>Your house is
     pleasantly situated for spying the neighbours all round, Skinner. Now do you know anything of
     an old codger in the next row named Tugboots.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>Tugboots! Yes, he's a poor-rate collector and an individual whom I abominate for the quantity
     of taxes he delivers, and the juries he makes me serve upon.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>Bravo, that's first rate. Then you wouldn't at all object to playing a little joke at his
     expense ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>Certainly not; within the bounds of a proper Christian feeling I should enjoy anything that
     would make him desperately savage.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>
     <stage>(aside)</stage>Just what I want. <stage>(aloud)</stage>Well then, old Tugboots has a
     very charming daughter whom I met at a party two months ago, and with whom I'm deeply in
     love—Violet.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>Violet Tugboots? What a name for a heroine. <stage>(making note in MS.)</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>Exactly what she's fitted for—a three volume novel. In return she's sincerely attached to
     me.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>A clear proof of lunacy.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>But she is so aggravatingly romantic that she will not allow me to introduce myself to her
     father. Of course I've proposed, and of course I want to be married, but as she is under age,
     if I run away with her it would be a case of abduction.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>Abduction ! The very thing. <stage>(making a note)</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p> Then I may rely on your aid ? <stage>(rising)</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>
     <stage>(courageously)</stage>You may. How do you feel now ? </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p> Better, thanks.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>What do you propose ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>This. 1 have a special license in my pocket, have made an appointment at a church close by,
     and only wait my opportunity for securing Violet. Now in case she should be watched, and a
     pursuit organized, it struck me as you have a back entrance here, that instead of proceeding

    <p>You can say : " Never! unless you would pass over my dead body." I expect this at least,

     <stage>(looking after him)</stage>Ten minutes, Cockleshot. I don't know that man from Adam, and
     this is how he proposes to let me in for it. Old Tugboots won't like it, that's certain. It'll
     serve him right, but I wonder what they can do to you for it. If it's abduction I don't want to
     be brought in as an accessory before the fact. No, no, still it's " flesh and blood"—the very
     thing wanted for my novel. <stage>(takes up newspaper — starts and reads)</stage>"
     Abduction—The learned judge in summing up regretted that in the present state of the law he
     could not give the prisoner more than two years." The old brute! quite enough too. Yet stay;
     what's Cockleshot to me or I to Cockleshot ? Shall I get rid of the responsibility by putting
     old Tugboots up to the move at once ? Get him in here and enjoy the parental agony. Egad, I
     will. That Cockleshot said he'd be here in ten minutes; there's just time.

    <p>How I was walking down the street, when I heard wild shrieks for help proceeding from this
     apartment.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tug.</speaker>
    <p>Then she is still here—what else ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>My first impulse was to take violently to my heels, for fear I might be implicated as a
     witness, and have to attend a police court.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tug.</speaker>
    <p>Naturally enough.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>My next to climb an adjacent lamp-post, that I might overlook and ascertain the cause of the
     disturbance, when I fortunately spied yon ladder.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tug.</speaker>
    <p>
     <stage>(seizing his hand)</stage>Brave young man, worthy young man, the courage and devotion
     you have displayed, prove to me that I may confide in you—I will. The heroine of the drama is
     my daughter, who is concealed on these premises; will you assist me to recover her ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>As an officer in such a cause would I get my sword out readily.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tug.</speaker>
    <p> How much is it in for?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>No, no, I don't mean that, but I've left it at home.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tug.</speaker>
    <p>Then run home and get it.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>But first, may I ask how you discovered your daughter was here ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tug.</speaker>
    <p>Read this, <stage>(shows letter)</stage>Delivered to me anonymously, ten minutes ago, but I
     recognised the handwriting to be that of the owner of this house.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>Never; Skinner has then betrayed me.</p>
   </sp>
   <pb n="14"/>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tug.</speaker>
    <p>Betrayed you?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>I mean you, the vagabond!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tug.</speaker>
    <p> It's a case of abduction —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>That shall meet with the swiftest retribution. <stage>(with intensity)</stage>Say, old man,
     what should be the reward of him who returned your daughter spotless to your arms ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tug.</speaker>
    <p> Reward! My dear fellow, I'd insist on his marrying her right off. <stage>(aside)</stage>Glad
     to get rid of her. <stage>(aloud)</stage>Be off for your sword, while I fetch my blunderbuss;
     you take charge of the front of the house, I'll surround the back. <stage>(goes to door, c. and
      tries it)</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>You must descend by the ladder. <stage>(hurries TUGBOOTS to window, L. and assists him
      out)</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tug.</speaker>
    <p>Hum! that's a nuisance, for this one wobbles so. Suppose we change?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>Not worth while. <stage>Tugboots disappears, L.</stage>
    </p>
    <stage> Violet peeps in, c.</stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Violet.</speaker>
    <p> Is it all right, Charles ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>
     <stage>(whispers)</stage>Yes, your father's yonder, I'm friends with him; but where's Skinner ?
     how did you get away ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Violet.</speaker>
    <p>He's ripping up a bolster to get feathers to burn under my nose.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>Indeed! Then 'twas he who betrayed us. <stage>(gets out of window, R.)</stage>Swords and

   </sp>

     smart for his interference. <stage>(writes)</stage>" Your perfidy is discovered, in ten minutes
     you will cease to exist—swords and blunderbusses ! Cockleshot —Tugboots." Now to place this

    <p>I wonder what has become of the juvenile Tugboots ? she's escaped.</p>

    <p>Hullo, confound it! <stage>(tries door)</stage>I'm fastened in <stage>(shouts)</stage>Miss

    <p>No, we don't; he knows me, but I don't know him.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Violet.</speaker>
    <p>Papa, forgive us. It was only a little plot to obtain your consent to our marriage this
     morning.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Tug.</speaker>
    <p>Plot! Consent—ridiculous nonsense. Did you say <pb n="16"/>Cockleshot ?—the son of Captain
     Cockleshot, an old rate-payer in this parish.</p>

    <p>Besides, what are the young couple to do? They must have a father to get married.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Violet.</speaker>
    <p>Then, sir, may we add to our obligations, and ask you to assist on the occasion?</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>Do come, Skinner, there's a good fellow.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p>Look here, Shuttlecock, I ain't a Skinner, but I'll come. <stage>(takes up novel)</stage>It's
     all experience—real flesh and blood—I must pen my sensations while they are vivid. First Vol.,

   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cockle.</speaker>
    <p>Think of that afterwards; you're delaying my marriage.</p>

    <p>
     <stage>(with a burst of satisfaction)</stage>Marriage! Ha, ha ! That's it. Suicide, poor devil!

   </sp>
   <sp>

    <p>Shan't forget your kindness, Mr. Skinner.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Twit.</speaker>
    <p> One moment. <stage>(puts on hat)</stage>Now then. <stage>(takes novel, and comes down to

      than"—<stage>(pauses)</stage>No, hang it, I can't go on—that fellow Tugboots' absurd conduct
     in getting into my water-, has quite ruined my feelings—so that instead of a novel—what do you
