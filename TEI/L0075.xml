<p>Don't be apprehensive, Sir; I have no wish to throw even a sneeze away.
<stage>(to Joliejambe)</stage>That young girl, whose humility excited your
ridicule, is the possessor of charms you never saw pourtrayed in your own glass,
Madam. Happy in her innocence, she was one night brutally insulted by some
things, in the guise of men. She struggled with her assailants, until one of
them, more courageous than the rest, struck her, and she fell bleeding and
insensible upon the pavement. I reached the spot in time to witness, not
prevent, the dastardly act. While I raised the bleeding victim, an humble friend
raised a mob; and between him and them her cowardly assailants were pretty well
pummelled. <stage>(takes snuff rapidly.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0075_M3">
<speaker>Long.</speaker>
<p>A capital subject for a domestic drama, Doctor. You, Mademoiselle, could play
the heroine. To be sure it would be a little out of your line, but then it would
be so interesting to have your eye put out, and make you tell your story in
broken English.</p>

<p>Thank'ee, doctor. I couldn't prevent her being disfigured by those

<p>That is French for leg.</p>

<p>What, jam? Then I can only say, English jam is nothing to French jam.</p>

<p>
<stage>(laughing)</stage>A mistake, Mademoiselle. Poor Bun wouldn't insult a
fly. The fact is, the rare combination of loveliness and talent, which met his
gaze last night, has put him a little beside himself. <stage>(to
Bun)</stage>Here is a manuscript which you must make a fair copy of. You
understand my writing.</p>

<p>
<stage>(at table, abstractedly)</stage>What a lucky fellow Mr. Longwind must be,
to have the <hi>entree</hi> to all the theatres, be master of such a fine house,
sit down to such meals, pass his days and nights eating, drinking, and romping
with beautiful women. Oh, what happiness !</p>

<sp who="#L0075_M1">
<speaker>Bun.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(coming forward)</stage>I should like to try it. Fifteen hours a day I do
nothing but scratch paper, and eat a solitary mutton chop. Never even dream of
the felicity of a supper, except on Saturdays, when I treat myself to two ounces
of ham. My life's a frightful monologue of scribbling, mutton chops, and
ham.</p>

<p>Why don't you sit in another ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0075_M1">
<speaker>Bun.</speaker>
<p>Why don't I ? Because I haven't another to sit in. I have a heart bursting
with noble, capacious, exalted aspirations. Yes, I feel here <stage>(placing his
hand upon his heart)</stage>that I want a fine, handsome, open room like this,
that I may lounge on the sofas with my legs anywhere and everywhere, and that I
may indulge in the society of the most lovely creatures in existence—I feel here
<stage>(hand on heart)</stage> that I could drink port, burgundy, champagne,
that I could eat turkey and sausages, roast-beef and plum-pudding; to sum up
all—I feel here, in my inmost heart, that I could kiss every young and pretty
woman that came in my way—my heart tells me all this, Doctor, and—damn it, how
it thumps!</p>

<p>Simply this:—After that dreadful night, when you so generously defended me,
the good Doctor, fearing the light might retard <pb n="17"/>my recovery,
bandaged my face, and when perfectly cured, by his advice, I continued the
bandage to protect my beauty, as he said, from the gaze of libertine eyes.</p>
</sp>

<p>Obtained a promise of marriage under false pretences. I thought you ugly,

<stage>(putting her arm round his neck)</stage>Dear, dear father, little did I
think it was a parent's arm that saved me on that dreadful night. Nature must

<p>Do you want to see me expire at your feet ? <stage>(frees himself from her
