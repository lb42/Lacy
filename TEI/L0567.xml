      <p>So, Joanna's hopes are wrecked, her happiness for ever blighted, and I am glad on't! I

       pine. <hi>She</hi> has had suitors, but no one whispered tales of love into my ear, that
       would so willingly have listened. <hi>She</hi> has ever been the favourite of our uncle.

       she greater beauty ? no—although she is as the lily, and I of the raven hue; and for her

       have I not <hi>seemed</hi>? and so well, that who could detect the counterfeit ? Oh, it was a

       so great his power—were my soul less dauntless than it is, 'twould terrify me ; so sudden oft
