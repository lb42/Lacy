<head>Act I</head>
<stage type="setting">Scene.— Handsome, Apartment in the House of Leeson and
Bates, Merchants — Door in C , with window on each side — Doors L.C. Flat and R.
2 E., Chairs, Tables, Sofa, &amp;c., &amp;c. </stage>

<stage>Mr. Leeson seated at table, R.H., over his private accounts. He puts his
pen in inkstand, and closes book.</stage>
<sp who="#L0001_M1">
<speaker>Lee.</speaker>
<p> That account's closed—a clear net profit to our house, Leeson and Bates, of
nine thousand pounds for the last year. So that, notwithstanding my little
extravagance for music and other masters for my daughter, I am at least a two
thousand pounds better than I was twelve months since. 'Gad! this is
capital—this is well! <stage>(rises)</stage> I don't know a prouder, happier
feeling that can enter the heart of man, than the knowledge that he leaves the
being of his very soul— his only child, the image of her he worshipped in his
spring of life— free from the chance of chilling poverty. It makes my heart leap
for joy when I think of it. Ha! here she comes.</p>
<stage> Enter Laura, D.R. 2 E. </stage>
<p>— Laura, my own pet, come to my arms! Oh! bless that face! how it reminds me
of your dear mother, now in— But there, we won't be melancholy to-day.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_F7">
<speaker>Laura.</speaker>
<p> Oh ! for mercy's sake, no, dear Sir; this house is not too lively at the
best of times.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M1">
<speaker>Lee.</speaker>
<p> Well, well—we'll be merry to-day, of all days in the year. But, where's your
cousin ? Where's my partner, Mathew Bates ?— what have you done with him ?—where
is he ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_F7">
<speaker>Laura.</speaker>
<p> Now, my dear Sir, how should I know where he is? I never appear before you,
but your first question is—" Where is Mathew ?—what have you done with Mathew
Bates?" Is Mathew Bates to be ever at my side ? He loves his desk better than he
loves society, I can tell you.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M1">
<speaker>Lee.</speaker>
<p> Well, I know he's fond of business; so am I—I always was.<stage>(
playfully)</stage> If I had not been fond of business, you little rogue, I
should not have had the pleasure of telling you, as I do now—that I have ten
thousand pounds for you when you wed, and as much more at my death.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_F7">
<speaker>Laura.</speaker>
<p> Which, my dear father, I trust may not occur for many— many years.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M1">
<speaker>Lee.</speaker>
<p> I hope not, upon my soul. I am very well as I am, and I don't want to change
my condition.</p>
<stage> Enter Mathew Bates, L.U.E. ; he is very plainly attired, having the
appearance of a young man without the fashionable pretension of dress, and his
style altogether unpretending — he has a pen in his hand. </stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M2">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p> Mr. Leeson, good day. Cousin— <stage>(to Laura, with respect)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M1">
<speaker>Lee.</speaker>
<p> Ah, Bates! Mathew, my, boy—my son—you are my son. Is he not, Laura?</p>
</sp>
<pb n="4"/>
<sp who="#L0001_F7">
<speaker>Laura.</speaker>
<p> Oh, yes, Sir—certainly—your adopted son.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M1">
<speaker>Lee.</speaker>
<p> Yes, and will be more by-and-bye—eh, Mathew ? <stage>(jokingly, but with
confidence)</stage> —eh, eh ?<stage>(Laura hems, and walks up)</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M2">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p><stage>(L.H.)</stage>Your son, Mr. Leeson, I truly am; for my father and
yourself were cousins, and, at his death, you became my protector. You were
relatives in heart as well as kin—friends—fast friends; which, in kin, is often
cast aside.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M1">
<speaker>Lee.</speaker>
<p> True, true, Mathew ! Ah, we were mere boys together, poor boys too, with
nothing but our energy to raise us. But we were friends, as you say—fast
friends, and we were so to his death. Poor Harry! We were odd fellows—
<stage>(to Laura, who comes down R.)</stage>—we were, Laura.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_F7">
<speaker>Laura.</speaker>
<p><stage>(L.C.)</stage>I don't doubt, Sir, at all. You are odd to this day, and
so is Harry's son.<stage>( glancing at Mathew)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M2">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p> In what particular, Laura ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_F7">
<speaker>Laura.</speaker>
<p> Oh, if you ask for <hi>particularities,</hi> we shall come to
<hi>personalities,</hi> and then I shall be scolded—shall I not, pa ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M1">
<speaker>Lee.</speaker>
<p> Aye, that you will. But, come, I find that we are both richer men;—a net
profit this year of nine thousand pounds to our house.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M2">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p> Yes, Sir, to that amount.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M1">
<speaker>Lee.</speaker>
<p> Egad, when I think how I toiled to get my first start in the world ! So did
your father ! Oh, yes! for there were two girls, poor as ourselves; we loved
<hi>them,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> loved us. Tis something to be loved in this
cold world, I can tell you.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M2">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p> It is, indeed, Sir!<stage>( with a sigh, glancing at Laura.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M1">
<speaker>Lee.</speaker>
<p> Well, we struggled and we succeeded, prospered, and, in prosperity, we both
married the girls who had loved us in adversity. Heaven, after, gave him a son
and me a daughter, but took our partners from us; his first—mine after. Her loss
weighed heavy upon his heart, and he shortly followed.—Poor Harry ! I shall
never forget his dying hour! "John," said he, "be a father to my little Mathew!"
"I will—I will, Harry," said I, grasping his cold hand, while tears flooded my
eye, and grief choked my utterance. "And if the children like each other,"
placing my hands on your little heads, as you stood almost unconscious of the
scene before you, " <hi>your</hi> Mathew shall marry <hi>my</hi> Laura, and be
indeed my son!" He raised his eyes to heaven, in reverence, then looked his last
kind look upon us, and left us for a better inheritance!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M2">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(aside, and sighing)</stage> My poor father!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M1">
<speaker>Lee.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(kindly)</stage> Mathew, what's the matter ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M2">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p> Nothing, Sir, nothing.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M1">
<speaker>Lee.</speaker>
<p> Come, come, don't be melancholy.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_F7">
<speaker>Laura.</speaker>
<p> La! how can he be other at this melancholy tale? You know he is not gay at
the best, and you will ever touch upon this subject.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M1">
<speaker>Lee.</speaker>
<p> Because I can't forget it. Never shall! But come, Mathew, give me your
hand—I will not mention it any more. Come, Laura, cheer him up; talk to him,
while I go and talk to the clerks. I shall be back shortly, and we'll have a
merry day of it. We have no reason to be other; we are prosperous, and there's
no reason on earth that we should be miserable; for myself, I'm determined to be
merry— nothing shall make me otherwise.<stage>Exit D.L.U.E</stage></p>
</sp>

<stage> Laura has taken up a book, and sits R.H. table. </stage>
<sp who="#L0001_M2">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p><stage>(looks at her)</stage>She speaks not. What is this tremor I feel ever
in her presence ? Why is she thus distant to me ? Is it woman's caution, pride,
or real dislike? I cannot fathom it; it was not so once.<stage>(approaches with
a timid but respectful feeling)</stage>You are reading, Laura, I suppose ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_F7">
<speaker>Laura.</speaker>
<p><stage>(looks carelessly)</stage>Now that is a very clever supposition
certainly. You see me with a book in my hand; you suppose I'm reading. What else
could you <hi>suppose</hi>, cousin ? </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M2">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p> We sometimes hold the book unconscious of the page; as we sometimes sit,
unconscious of the presence of those by whom we are surrounded. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_F7">
<speaker>Laura.</speaker>
<p> True; what we take no <hi>interest</hi> in, we seldom think much of.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M2">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p> By such rule, I might be in your presence and you unconscious.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_F7">
<speaker>Laura.</speaker>
<p> Aye, that you might.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M2">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p> Indeed!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_F7">
<speaker>Laura.</speaker>
<p> Indeed! Ha, ha, ha! Why that strange look? do you think yourself so
handsome, or so full of <hi> grace</hi>, that I must have you ever in my
thoughts?<stage>(pettishly)</stage>What vanity !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M2">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p><stage>(with pride)</stage>Vanity, Laura, I am bound to say is my last foible
! I hold that vanity in man is not to be pardoned or excused.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_F7">
<speaker>Laura.</speaker>
<p> How in woman ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M2">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p> We test not woman so strictly—vanity in her is scarcely vanity.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_F7">
<speaker>Laura.</speaker>
<p><stage>(sits)</stage>Ha, ha, ha!—what a paradox!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M2">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p><stage>(by her chair)</stage>Woman is a paradox.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_F7">
<speaker>Laura.</speaker>
<p> Indeed!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M2">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p> Yes, indeed! by education taught to be so,—schooled in restraint, her
thoughts, her feelings even as a girl, are pent up from the world: her own heart
is the sanctum in after life, even of that love she pines to own, another may be
dying but to know; but when known, he loves her more for the suffering she has
caused—for he feels that she is master of herself—the greatest mastery achieved
on earth.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_F7">
<speaker>Laura.</speaker>
<p> Forgets that, master of herself—she may be his master too.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M2">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p> Woman, however she conceal her power, is ever so; for by submission, and by
complacent kindness—that ever winning grace, by which woman rules instead of
serves—she may win the roughest temper, and the rudest mind, to follow and to
worship.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_F7">
<speaker>Laura.</speaker>
<p> Oh, really, cousin—<stage>(acknowledges)</stage>but when I rule, it will be
by right—I shall steal no march under false colours, upon the heart of lordly
man, believe me.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M2">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p><stage>(quickly)</stage>Then you do not love ?</p>

<p> Whom should I love ?—you ?</p>

<p><stage>(sits R.H. to work)</stage>Ha, ha, ha ! I have got rid of him at last.
He talk of love, with his business face and his plain careless habit ?
Ridiculous ! he has no life, fire, or boldness, for a lover. I like him very
well as my cousin, with a pen stuck behind his ear, and seated at his desk. I
know my father, and he too, expect me to become his wife, and that I shall love
him; as if love were entered and booked per order. Not with me, I can tell them
! What is love without romance, danger, and difficulty—without prayers, tears,
and entreaties ? That's the love for me; a lover my father scorns and I adore,
who has not a penny in his purse—that's the man for me. But to marry cousin
Mathew Bates ! Make love by rule of three; father, daughter, lover; have the
settlement drawn out like a bill of exchange; marry; and ever after settle down
into quiet Mrs. Bates. What a name !—Bates !—Mrs. Bates! Were it Danvers,
Craven, Courtland—but Bates ! It might as well be Daw or Caw, Cook or Rook, or
anything. No, no ! My cousin certainly has good eyes— if he knew how to use
them; fine teeth—if he knew how to show them; and his hair is good—but the
style—oh, horrid !</p>

hand; I have promised to do so for his happiness and my own. But there's
something here. <stage>(places his hand on his breast)</stage> It is not
pride—it is not fear. Yet I pause upon the act—and why ? Because I feel that
should rejection come it must tear me hence. Situated as I am—uncertain of my
fate—I could linger near her 'till life's end, yet still love on—but rejected, I
must quit all or die. It has grown with me from childhood; to watch her varying
temper was to me a joy; to tend her lightest wish, my happiness. As time
fulfilled its promise in her growing form, so stronger grew my love; but in her
there seemed a cold reserve, a freezing check to all my kindness ; and now—she
comes.</p>

<p> A good many, Sir. I've contemplated them a long time. There's a sort of

the first corner, leans against his brother—the post—uncertain which way the
wind may carry him. He has no guiding principle—as they say—or impulsive power.
He wants to find out which way will lead him to his point, forgetting all <pb
n="11"/> the while that he has no point. He starts off: the hours move
heavily—so does he—till he finds himself out of town and out of sorts;—enters a
tavern—dines—drinks—smokes his cigar—looks out of the window—sees happy faces,
lads and lasses, fond couples and rosy children, pass by,—sighs—puffs—gets the
fidgets—starts forth —returns towards home,—meets another lordly freeman, as
blessed as himself—they join—they drink—get happy for the night, to wake more

<p> Three years since, Mathew left us, to superintend our foreign house at
Lyons. Three years! I thought myself then free— free as the bird that skims the
air in its wild and happy flight—free to fix my choice if the object came
without restraint or control; and suitors have come—have offered for my hand,
yet all have I rejected —and why ? Because my beau ideal of a lover was but a
dream ! I looked for outward grace, and not for inward worth, that solid base on
which our choice should fix. Charles Clinton ! a fashion's fool. Strange! since
cousin Mathew left us, without to me even an adieu, he has been ever with me; as
each week, month, year, has passed, he has come nearer to my fancy's image. Time
has told its tale upon my heart, thoughts, and feelings; and I who drove him
hence, would give the world to draw him back to me—but pride says no. In my
dreams he is with me, in my waking hours ever in my mind. Remembrance of the
pain I caused him strikes the chords of self-reproach, till I am unfit for
converse or society.</p>

<p> Yes ! All who have hearts to feel and eyes to admire. I was but seventeen
when I was over head and ears in love with your mother; and truly I believe, if
I hadn't fallen into love, I should never have fallen into luck. It cheered me
in my poverty—gave me courage to encounter difficulty, strength to toil, energy
to acheive reward for all; for I met a kind eye to look upon, a heart to feel
for me—to guide me through every difficulty. And, more than that, I found that I
toiled for other than myself.</p>

<p> What <hi>can</hi> be done? You first reject the man, who, for your sake,
quits his early happiness. You ridicule him, his very name; and when, cured of
the wound you have inflicted upon his heart, about to wed another, you ask, can
aught be done to save you ? What can be done? Daughter, this is the first unkind
word I ever spoke to you—what can he do, but wed her to whom. he has given his
honour? Can he wrong, break his plight to her—for one, who lightly cast him off,
to gratify, as it now appears, a captious and unfeeling tyranny ?<stage>(Laura

<p> Strange—very strange !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M2">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p> Not so. My first remembrance is here. Your father, my protector; you, my
playmate; and, as time shadowed forth all coming hope, you were the ministers,
through whom I was to receive fortune, content, and love; and when, as in a
dream,(time flew so happily on)I stepped from boy to man, the same feelings
strengthened; day by day, I saw you pass from girl to woman's stature,
loveliness—<stage>(she starts)</stage>Your pardon; for I flatter not. I saw no
speck upon its radiance. I loved you—Your pardon still,<stage>(with great
feeling)</stage>if the tear start to my eye, and recollection choke my
utterance. I perceived a growing check to my every kind attention. Oh, the
watchful, waking hours that hung upon my pillow! I strove to please, but, as
each kind word fell tremulously from my quivering lip, it was met by raillery
and contempt from yours. At last came the day I was to hear from the being I had
worshipped, that, if I had nurtured in my heart one hope that she could ever be
mine, I was to cast that feeling from me.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_F7">
<speaker>Laura.</speaker>
<p> And you did so, Mathew, without entreaty, or——</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M2">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p> Oh, what entreaty could equal the devotion, that from boy to man I lavished
upon you, Laura? I could not entreat; your words iced my heart, freezing my
every vein; I could not ask that I knew must be refused. I loved you too well,
with too much honour, to beg your hand, not coupled with your heart. Your
happiness, not your misery, was my aim; and, rather than inflict one pang on you
or yours, I fled a home, which else to me was heaven,<stage>(with great
fervour)</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_F7">
<speaker>Laura.</speaker>
<p><stage>(as if sunk in spirit)</stage>You did, upon the instant—without
leave-taking—or word.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0001_M2">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p> There are moments, Laura, when the bravest man is palled; but be he man, he
calls his manhood to his aid, and looks again towards hope; and so with
me—wrecked in the love I bore you, I hoped, I struggled, I conquered. 'Twas your
wish I should discard you from my thoughts—regard you only as a sister.
<hi>Sister</hi>, I have done so.<stage>(proudly, but not with vanity)</stage>
