     <sp who="#L0441_4">
      <speaker>Philip.</speaker>
      <p>Never tell me !—I repeat it, you are a fellow of a very scandalous course of life ! But
       what principally offends me is, that you pervert the minds of the maids, and keep kissing and
       smuggling all the pretty girls you meet. Oh ! fye! fye ! <stage>(Crosses R.)</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_5">
      <speaker>Motley.</speaker>
      <p>I kiss and smuggle them? St. Francis forbid! Lord love you, father, 'tis they who kiss and
       smuggle me. I protest, I do what I can to preserve my modesty; and I wish that the Archbishop
       Dunstan had heard the lecture upon chastity which I read last night to the dairy-maid in the
       dark! he'd have been quite edified. But yet what does talking signify ? The eloquence of my
       lips is counteracted by the lustre of my eyes; and really the little devils are so tender,
       and so troublesome, that I'm half angry with nature for having made me so very
       bewitching.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_4">
      <speaker>Philip.</speaker>
      <p>Nonsense ! nonsense !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_5">
      <speaker>Motley.</speaker>
      <p>Put yourself in my place:—suppose that a sweet, smiling rogue, just sixteen, with rosy
       cheeks, sparkling eyes, pouting lips, &amp;c.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_4">
      <speaker>Philip.</speaker>
      <p>Oh, fye ! fye ! fye!—To hear such licentious discourse brings the tears into my eyes!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_5">
      <speaker>Motley.</speaker>
      <p>I believe you, father; for I see the water is running over at your mouth; which puts me in
       mind, my good father, that there are some little points which might be altered in you still
       better than in myself: such as intemperance, gluttony——</p>
     </sp>
     <pb n="4"/>
     <sp who="#L0441_4">
      <speaker>Philip.</speaker>
      <p>Gluttony! Oh! abominable falsehood !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_5">
      <speaker>Motley.</speaker>
      <p>Plain matter of fact!—Why, will any man pretend to say that you came honestly by that
       enormous belly, that tremendous tomb of fish, flesh, and fowl ? And, for incontinence, you
       must allow, yourself, that you are unequalled.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_4">
      <speaker>Philip.</speaker>
      <p>I!—I!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_5">
      <speaker>Motley.</speaker>
      <p>You ! you!—May I ask what was your business in the beech grove the other evening, when I
       caught you with buxom Margery, the miller's pretty wife ? Was it quite necessary to lay your
       heads together so close ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_4">
      <speaker>Philip.</speaker>
      <p>Perfectly necessary: I was whispering in her ear wholesome advice.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_5">
      <speaker>Motley.</speaker>
      <p>Indeed ? Faith then she took your advice as kindly as it was given, and exactly in the same
       way too: you gave it with your lips, and she took it with hers.— Well done, father Philip
       !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_4">
      <speaker>Philip.</speaker>
      <p>Son, son, you give your tongue too great a license.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_5">
      <speaker>Motley.</speaker>
      <p>Nay, father, be not angry: fools, you know, are privileged persons.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_4">
      <speaker>Philip.</speaker>
      <p>I know they are very useless ones ; and in short, master Motley, to be plain with you, of
       all fools I think you the worst; and for fools of all kinds I've an insuperable aversion.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_5">
      <speaker>Motley.</speaker>
      <p>Really ? Then you have one good quality at least, and I cannot but admire such a total want
       of self­love ! <stage>(Bell rings, L.)</stage> But, hark! there goes the dinner- bell—away to
       table, father.—Depend upon't, the servants will rather eat part of their dinner unblessed,
       than stay till your stomach comes like Jonas's whale, and swallows up the whole.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_4">
      <speaker>Philip.</speaker>
      <p>Well, well, fool; I am going ; but first let me explain to you, that my bulk proceeds from
       no indulgence of voracious appetite. No, son, no—little sustenance do I take ; but St.
       Cuthbert's blessing is upon me, and that little prospers with me most marvellously. Verily,
       the saint has given me rather too plentiful an increase, and my legs are scarce able to
       support the weight of his bounties.</p>

     <stage>Exit through gate, L. U. E</stage>

      <speaker>Motley.</speaker>
      <p>He looks like an overgrown turtle, waddling
       <pb n="5"/>upon its hind fins! Yet, at bottom, 'tis a good fellow enough, warm hearted,
       benevolent, friendly, and sincere ; but no more intended by nature to be a monk, than I to be
       a maid of honour to the queen of Sheba.</p>

      <speaker>Percy.</speaker>
      <p><stage>(R.)</stage> Have ten years altered me so much that you cannot——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_5">
      <speaker>Motley.</speaker>
      <p>Hey !—can it be—Pardon me, my dear lord Percy.—In truth, you may well forgive my having
       forgotten your name, for at first I didn't very well remember my own. However, to prevent
       further mistakes, I must inform you that he who in your father's service was Gilbert the
       knave, is Motley the fool in the service of Earl Osmond.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_3">
      <speaker>Percy.</speaker>
      <p>Of Earl Osmond ?—This is fortunate. Gilbert, you may be of use to me; and if the attachment
       which, as a boy you professed for me still exists—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_5">
      <speaker>Motley.</speaker>
      <p>It does, with ardour unabated, for I'm not so unjust as to attribute to you my expulsion
       from Alnwick Castle: but now, sir, may I ask, what brings you to Wales ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_3">
      <speaker>Percy.</speaker>
      <p>A woman whom I adore.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_5">
      <speaker>Motley.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, I guessed that the business was about a petticoat. And this woman is—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_3">
      <speaker>Percy.</speaker>
      <p><stage>(R.)</stage> The orphan ward of a villager, without friends, without family, without

     <sp who="#L0441_5">
      <speaker>Motley.</speaker>
      <p><stage>(L.)</stage> Great points in her favor, I must confess. And which of these excellent
       qualities won your heart ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_3">
      <speaker>Percy.</speaker>
      <p>I hope I had better reasons for bestowing it on her. No, Gilbert; I loved her for a person
       beautiful without art and graceful without affectation, for a heart tender without weakness,
       and noble without pride. I saw her at once beloved and reverenced by her village companions;
       they looked on her as a being of a superior order :
       <pb n="6"/>and I felt, that she who gave such dignity to a cottage maid, must needs add new
       lustre to the coronet of the Percies.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_5">
      <speaker>Motley.</speaker>
      <p>From which I am to understand that you mean to marry this rustic ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_3">
      <speaker>Percy.</speaker>
      <p>Could I mean otherwise I should blush for myself.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_5">
      <speaker>Motley.</speaker>
      <p>Yet, surely, the baseness of her origin—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_3">
      <speaker>Percy.</speaker>
      <p>Can to me be no objection: in giving her my hand I raise her to my station, not debase
       myself to hers ; nor ever, while gazing on the beauty of a rose, did I think it less fair
       because planted by a peasant.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_5">
      <speaker>Motley.</speaker>
      <p>Bravo !—And what says your good grumbling father to this ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_3">
      <speaker>Percy.</speaker>
      <p>Alas! he has long slept in the grave.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_5">
      <speaker>Motley.</speaker>
      <p>Then he's quiet at last! Well, heaven grant him that peace above, which he suffered nobody
       to enjoy below. But his death having left you master of your actions, what obstacle now
       prevents your marriage ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_3">
      <speaker>Percy.</speaker>
      <p>You shall hear.—Fearful lest my rank should influence this lovely girl's affections, and
       induce her to bestow her hand on the noble, while she refused her heart to the man, I assumed
       a peasant's habit, and presented myself as Edwy, the low-born and the poor. In this character
       I gained her heart, and resolved to hail as Countess of Northumberland, the betrothed of Edwy
       the low­born and the poor! Judge, then, how great must have been my disappointment, when, on
       entering her guardian's cottage with this design, he informed me, that the unknown, who

      <p>Oh! that will never do: for, in the first place, you'll not be able to get a sight of him.
       I've now lived with him five long years, and till Angela's arrival, never witnessed a guest
       in the castle. Oh! 'tis the most melancholy mansion! And as to the earl, he's the very
       antidote to mirth. He always walks with his arms folded, his brows bent, his eyes lowering on
       you with a gloomy scowl: he never smiles; and to laugh in his presence would be treason. He
       looks at no one—speaks to no one. None dare approach him, except Kenric and his four blacks—
       all others are ordered to avoid him ; and whenever he quits his room, ding! dong ! goes a
       great bell, and away runs the servants like so many scared rabbits.</p>

      <p>Oh! reasons in plenty. You must know there's an ugly story respecting the last owners of
       this castle. Osmond's brother, his wife, and infant child were murdered by banditti, as it
       was said: unluckily, the only servant who escaped the slaughter, deposed, that he recognised
       among the assassins a black still in the service of Earl Osmond. The truth of this assertion
       was never known, for the servant was found dead in his bed the next morning.</p>

      <p>Since that time no sound of joy has been heard in Conway Castle. Osmond instantly became

       society, and keeps his gates barred unceasingly against the stranger.</p>

      <speaker>Saib.</speaker>
      <p>Horsemen, say you ?—Then Kenric may be right. Earl Percy has discovered Angela's abode, and

     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_8">
      <speaker>Hassan.</speaker>
      <p>His hopes then will be vain. Osmond's vigilance will not easily be eluded—sharpened by

      <p>If Percy gains her—everything! Supported by such wealth and power, dangerous would be her
       claim
       <pb n="9"/>to these domains, should her birth be discovered. Of this our lord is aware; nor

     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_8">
      <speaker>Hassan.</speaker>
      <p>I know she does not. Absorbed in her own passion for Percy, on Osmond she bestows no
       thought, and, while roving through these pompous halls and chambers, sighs for the Cheviot
       hills and Allan's humble cottage.</p>

     <sp who="#L0441_7">
      <speaker>Saib.</speaker>
      <p>But as she still believes Percy to be a low-born swain, when Osmond lays his coronet at her

     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0441_8">
      <speaker>Hassan.</speaker>
      <p>If she loves well, she will. Saib, I too have loved! I have known how painful it was to
       leave her on whom my heart hung; how incapable was all else to supply her loss! I have
       exchanged want for plenty, fatigue for rest, a wretched hut for a splendid palace. But am I
       happier! Oh no ! Still do I regret my native land, and the partners of my poverty. Then toil
       was sweet to me, for I laboured for Samba! then repose ever blessed my bed of leaves, for
       there by my side lay Samba sleeping.</p>

      <speaker>Hassan.</speaker>
      <p>Did it ? Oh, Saib! my heart once was gentle, once was good! But sorrows have broken it,
       insults have made it hard! I have been dragged from my native land, from a wife who was
       everything to me, to whom I was everything! Twenty years have elapsed since these Christians
       tore me away; they trampled upon my heart, mocked my despair, and, when in frantic terms I
       raved of Samba, laughed, and wondered how a negro's soul could feel! In that moment, when the
       last point of Africa faded from my view, when as I stood on the vessel's deck, I felt that
       all I loved was to me lost for ever, in that bitter moment did I banish humanity from my
       breast. I tore from my arm the bracelet of Samba's hair ; I gave to the sea the precious
       token, and while the high waves swift bore it from me, vowed, aloud, endless hatred to
       mankind. I have kept my oath, I <emph>will</emph> keep it! <stage>(Crosses to R.)</stage></p>

      <p>Why, then, they do say, that the chamber in in which you sleep is haunted. You may have
       observed two folding doors, which are ever kept locked: they lead to the oratory, in which
       the Lady Evelina passed most of her time, while my lord was engaged in the Scottish wars. She
       would sit there, good soul ! hour after hour, playing on the lute, and singing airs so sweet,
       so sad, that many a time and oft have I wept to hear her. Ah ! when I kissed her hand at the
       castle-gate, little did I suspect that her fate would have been so wretched!</p>

      <p>A sad one, lady ! Impatient to embrace her lord, after a year's absence, the countess set
       out to meet him on his return from Scotland, accompanied by a few domestics and her infant
       daughter, then scarce a twelvemonth old. But, as she returned with her husband, robbers
       surprised the party scarce a mile from the castle; and since that time, no news has been
       received of the earl, of the countess, the servants, or the child.</p>

       some sixty years ago, may be seen in the great hall regularly at midnight, playing at
