<stage>Enter BATTER, R.</stage>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> I declare, if it wasn't for meeting some of the girls as they come home from
flower-making, I should feel as lonely as a milestone. Three years have I been
in the force, and a woman of fortune hasn't fallen in love with me so far. I've
been looking out for a roll of bank-notes without an owner, for the last two
years, but I haven't seen 'em yet. I fancy there is more chance for a fellow in
the army. I wish I was a blue Scotch grey, instead of a blue bobby. A man of my
appearance ought to do something; men of my personal attractions are not picked
up every day ; but still I don't seem to go off, somehow. Ladies of fortune!
where is your taste ? Open your eyes, some of you, or I'll take a dreadful oath
to die single. Ah, it's the dinner hour at Madame Fanchon's, and here come some
of her hands. I wish one of them would set me on my legsâ€”but, like me, their
faces are their fortunes. <stage> Enter ANNE BROWN, MARY GREEN, CARRY WHITE, and
others, R.</stage> Good day, ladiesâ€”flowers of Nature, who live by making
artificial ones. May husbands of a thousand a year marry every one of you, and
sprigs of little offshoots blossom in the garden of your happiness.</p>

<speaker>Girls.</speaker>
<p>Oh, beautiful!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> What, meâ€”yes, I know I'm beautiful, but I'm born to blush unseen, and waste
my sweetness in the desert square. Is any of you got uncles with moneyâ€”I don't
mean pawnbrokers, but natural born uncles ?</p>
</sp>

<p> No !</p>

<sp who="#L1300_M4">

<p> Then <hi>adoo,</hi> and farewell, my dears ! all of you are doomed to remain
virgin maidens, as far as I am concerned. Goâ€”go, my children, <stage>(crosses

</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F20">

<p> His children! Why, he'll never have the honour of being a father. Good-bye,
Blueskin. <stage>(exeunt, L.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> What, Blueskin ! Come, now, that's too bad ; it's enough to make one wild.
Now, here comes a much more civil and pretty girl. I always did like Miss Bobbin
â€”but whether that's her surname or her Christian one, I don't knowâ€”I'll ask
her.</p>
</sp>

<stage>Enter BOBBIN, R.</stage>

<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> Ah, Miss Bobbin, how do you do ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> Ah, Mr. Batter, how do you do?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">

<p> Well, just moving on.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> Not promoted yet ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> No, not made chief commissioner at present.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> I'm sure you ought to beâ€”what's Government thinking of ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p><stage>(aside)</stage> Now she <hi>is</hi> a sensible girlâ€”if she only had
prospects, <stage>(aloud)</stage> I suppose you haven't got anything in your eye
?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> Which eye ? Is one of them watering ? <stage>(rubbing eyes.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> I don't mean thatâ€”I mean, have you, at any time, anything likely to be left
you ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> What, money ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> Yes.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> Well, I think some day there will be a little coming to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> Ah, Miss Bobbin, you don't know what a great favourite you always were of
mine.</p>
</sp>
<pb n="7"/>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> How should I, when you never told me ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> I didn't know it myself till just now. By-the- bye, is Bobbin your Christian
or surname ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> It's both.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> How can that be ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> Why, because my reg'lar name is Robinette Robins; my father's name was Robin
Robins, and my mother had me called as near after him as possible, by naming me
Robinette ; then the girls, for shortness, called me Bobinâ€”others called me Bob
; some began to call me Bob, and Bob Robbins, until at last it got to be
Bobbins, and Bobbins it seems likely to remain.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> Now, isn't it singular that both our names begin with a B ? Mine's Batter,
and yours is Bobbinâ€”Batter and Bobbin.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> Yes, one letter for both names ; and my friend Lizzie Lyle's name is begun
both ways with one letterâ€” L for Lizzie, and L for Lyleâ€”L. L.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> You see it hung up in most publicans' windows â€”L. L., which means Lord
Lieutenant's whiskey ; so, perhaps she comes of the same family.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> Perhaps she does, and she's a genteel girl. She don't write badâ€”neither do
I, and if we get hold of a hard word, we mix a lot of letters together to look
as like it as possible.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p>Has she got a sweetheart ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> There's one as wants to beâ€”Madame Fanchon's clerk; Mounseer Froggyvoo we
call him, but Adolphe Durand, I believe, is his correct name.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> Does she like Froggyvoo ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> Not at all; and when she goes out he's always following her. <stage>(looks
R.) </stage>He's following her now, although he knows she has only an hour for
dinner ; but here I am talking when I've got to get her dinner ready. I wish you
wouldn't keep me talking hereâ€”my time will be up. Goodbyeâ€”things ought to be
done, and time is flying, and dinner ought to be fryingâ€”this and that put to
rights, and I don't know what all. <stage>(exit, L.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> But Robinette Bobbinsâ€”Bobbinsâ€”Robâ€”Bobâ€” stop, a word with youâ€”half a word,
stop! <stage>(exit, L.</stage></p>
</sp>


<stage> Enter LIZZIE, R., followed by Adolphe.</stage>

<sp who="#L1300_F12">
<speaker>Lizzie.</speaker>
<p> Now, Mr. Durand, what a strange thing it is ; although there are plenty of
girls working on our establishment, you will always insist on forcing your
society upon me whenever you see me alone. Why do you do it ?</p>
</sp>
<pb n="8"/>
<sp who="#L1300_M3">
<speaker>Adolphe.</speaker>
<p> Because, ma'amselle, I feel confidant that you adore me.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F12">
<speaker>Lizzie.</speaker>
<p> I don'tâ€”quite the reverse. You are too conceited, and fancy every girl is in
love with you ; and, now, I'd better tell you what I've long had on my mind : I
don't like you at allâ€”in fact, to put a stop to your annoyance, I may say I
detest youâ€”there !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M3">
<speaker>Adolphe.</speaker>
<p>Why, you insult me ! Is it insolent in this country to say to a ma'amselle
you love her ? This is insult, and insult I take from no one. <hi>You</hi>
despise me, indeed! and for vhy ? You are no fine lady. I suppose you think some
gentleman will offer you his fortuneâ€”bah, you vill see!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F12">
<speaker>Lizzie.</speaker>
<p><stage>(aside)</stage> I have spoken too plainlyâ€”he has influence with
madame, and may injure me in her good opinion.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M3">
<speaker>Adolphe.</speaker>
<p> Despise, indeed! A moment past I adore you â€”now I hate, and ven I hate it is
strongâ€”you shall be sorryâ€”you shall be punish. Remember, I say it, Adolphe
Durand. <stage>(crosses, L.)</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F12">
<speaker>Lizzie.</speaker>
<p> But I didn't mean â€”â€” </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M3">
<speaker>Adolphe.</speaker>
<p> Bah ! I knowâ€”have fearâ€”be afraid alvays. <stage>(aside)</stage> Now I vill
set de trap for herâ€”she shall be ruin. <stage>(exit, L.</stage></p>
</sp>



<sp who="#L1300_F12">
<speaker>Lizzie.</speaker>
<p> I've made that man my enemyâ€”he told me to beware of him. He will be coward

<p> Yes, guv'nor, we've not long taken to the honest trade of prigging, but was

<p> No, he can'tâ€”his eddication was neglected in early lifeâ€”he can only make his
