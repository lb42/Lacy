   <head>Ici On Parle Francais.</head>
   <stage>Scene. —A Parlour, in total disorder. Door at back—two doors, R., and one L.—a window,
    with ample curtains—table, chairs, &amp;c.—on a table, L., there stands a glass vase, containing
    water, and in which flowers are standing—on the wall, various pictures are suspended.</stage>
   <stage>At the rising of the curtain Angelina is discovered, sewing rings on some curtains—Anna
    Maria is engaged in dusting chairs violently.</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Anna.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(dusting)</stage> There—and there—and there ! Oh, if ever I have a servant, won't I
     serve her out for this!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Spriggins.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(outside door R., calling)</stage> Anna Maria!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Anna.</speaker>
    <p> Yes, sir!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Spriggins.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(without)</stage> Bring me those window curtains—I'll put them up myself.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Angel.</speaker>
    <p> Why, pa, I haven't half finished sewing the rings on !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mrs.</speaker>
    <p> Spriggins. <stage>(outside, L., calling)</stage> Anna Maria!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Anna.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(dusting)</stage> Yes, ma'am.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>

   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Anna.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(aside)</stage> What a bother it is, to be sure—I shall never get this tiresome
     dusting done !</p>

    <speaker>Spriggins.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(R.)</stage> Anna Maria!</p>

    <p><stage>(l.)</stage> Anna Maria!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Anna.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(bawling)</stage> Now, then, which is it to be ? You don't expect me to go two ways
     at once, surely !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Angel.</speaker>
    <p> Oh dear—oh dear ! This scheme of pa's will wear us all out. How sorry I am that he ever took
     it into his head to let lodgings!</p>
    <pb n="4"/>
    <stage>Enter Mrs. Spriggins, L.</stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p>Well, thank goodness the bedrooms are ready Why, Anna Maria, what have you been about ? I
     declare, the parlour is not finished yet!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Anna.</speaker>
    <p> Please mum, I arn't got fifty pair o' hands. I really must have a boy from the work'us to
     help me !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(languidly)</stage> For my part, I declare I'm ready to faint!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Anna.</speaker>
    <p> Faint! I've been a faintin' ever since five this mornin'!</p>
    <stage>Enter Mr. Spriggins, door R. 3 E., with a double ladder over his shoulder.</stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> Now, then, will these curtains be ready to-day, or am I to expect them sometime<hi> next
     week</hi> ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Angel.</speaker>
    <p> Pa, I declare I can't work any faster.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(in a dignified tone)</stage> Remember, Mr. Spriggins, your daughter is not a hired
     needlewoman.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(mildly)</stage> Very true, my dear! That being the case I'll just fill up the time
     by dusting the pictures a bit. <stage>(seizes duster, mounts ladder and dusts
     picture)</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Anna.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(wiping her face with apron)</stage> I declare I can't stand it no longer!
     <stage>(throws herself back into an armchair, R.)</stage> I 'spose I've a right to breathe as
     well as other people.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p>Anna Maria! You lazy, dawdling creature, go and take the rest of our things up to the top of
     the house.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Anna.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(aside)</stage> There she goes again! A pretty notion! They're all going to live up
     in the garret—just to make every farthing they can by letting the rest o' the house!
     Mean-spirited, covetous creatures!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p>Well, I must say, Mr. Spriggins, it's excessively disagreeable, for a lady like myself,
     remotely connected with the noble family of the Fitz-Pentonvilles to leave my comfortable
     apartments, and live up in a wretched attic !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Angel.</speaker>
    <p> And to be condemned to dress in a dark little closet, no bigger than a cupboard.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Anna.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(at door)</stage> And to have to sleep in a willanous back kitchen—all among the
     nasty rats and black beetles. It's a shame, it is! <stage>Exit, c. door to l.</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(to Angelina)</stage> And all to gratify your papa's absurd propensity for
     speculation.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(coming down ladder)</stage> Speculation, Mrs. Spriggins— and a very promising
     speculation it is, too! Here's the bathing season coming on—a tremendous influx of visitors
     arriving—no
     <pb n="5"/>end of distinguished foreigners expected! Why, bless your heart, lodgings will be at
     a premium !—so I'm determined to make hay while the sun shines—and sublet every square inch of
     deal board we can possibly dispense with ! I'll wager we shall reap a golden harvest. And I
     tell you what, Mrs. Spriggins, to compensate for any little incovenience you may have to put up
     with, I intend to take you and Angelina up to town, and treat you to
     the—<stage>(hesitating)</stage> a—a—to the British Museum and National Gallery.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Angel.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(pensively)</stage> I'd much sooner you'd take us to Paris, Pa.
     <stage>(sighing)</stage> Heigh ho!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p>There she is again with her Paris! Ever since we allowed her to spend a month with her aunt
     in Paris, she has thought of nothing else.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Angel.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(somewhat confused)</stage> The curtains are quite ready now, pa. <stage>(lays them
     on sofa)</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> That's right, my dear,—now arrange the flower pots so as to impart an air of botanical
     elegance to the apartment. <stage>(Angelina arranges flower pots, &amp;c.)</stage> By the bye,
     my dear, <stage>(to his wife, producing book from his pocket)</stage> now that we've a moment
     to spare, you may as well hear me my French lesson.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Angel.</speaker>
    <p> French, indeed! the idea of a man at your time of life beginning to learn French !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> How very blind some females are to be sure—don't you perceive, Mrs. Spriggins, that I'm
     laying myself out to catch lodgers among foreigners of distinction, people who hardly know the
     difference between a franc and a sovereign, and who, therefore, will agree to pay whatever I
     think proper to ask them. Are you not aware, madam, that I've got "Lodgings to Let" "Ici on
     Parle Francais," in large type, stuck in my parlour window. I am, therefore, preparing myself
     for emergencies, by studying that politest of languages, on a remarkably expeditious system,
     entitled, "French before Breakfast," a system which renders the aid of a master totally
     superfluous, and enables the student to speak with Parisian purity, in rather less than no
     time. You'd be astonished at the progress I have made already! <stage>(with an atrociously bad
     pronunciation)</stage> <hi>"Bongjore mounseer; commong vouz portez vous, a-a-donnez moi du
     pain, passez moi la moutarde." </hi><stage>(exultingly)</stage> By Jove ! they'll be enraptured
     on hearing their native tongue spoken with such extraordinary fluency, and I shall double their
     rent in consequence. <stage>(bell rings at c.)</stage> Bless my soul, there's a ring! I dare
     say it's somebody to look at the apartments. Dear, dear! here's a confusion!—quick, quick ! put
     <pb n="6"/>these chairs in order. <stage>(great bustle and running about)</stage> Angelina,
     make your escape with this work basket—run!</p>
    <stage>Exit Angelina, R. 1 E., with basket.</stage>
    <stage>Enter Anna Maria showing in Victor and Mrs Major Rattan, c. from l.</stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Anna.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(sulkily)</stage> Please, sir, it's sum 'un to look at the lodgings! <stage>Exit Anna
     Maria, c. to l.</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(aside)</stage> Hat and pantaloons evidently foreign. <stage>(rubbing his
     hands)</stage> My "Ici on Parle Francais" has evidently done the business. Now for a little
     "French before breakfast." <stage>(after a great deal of bowing and scraping)</stage> Ahem !
     Monsieur and Madame, vennez pore apartemong! <stage>(aside to his wife)</stage> You know one
     feels a little awkward just at first.</p>

    <p> You were pleased to observe ?</p>

    <p> <hi>Quels apartemens avez vous á louer?</hi></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> Dear me! how very extraordinary, I don't remember meeting with anything of the sort in
     "French before Breakfast." <stage>(turns over leaves of his book)</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(aside to Spriggins)</stage> Why don't you say something?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(confused)</stage> A—a—he pronounces so very indistinctly that a—a—I have some slight
     difficulty in making out what he says.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(to Victor)</stage> This person evidently doesn't understand French.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Victor.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(to Spriggins)</stage> You no comprehend ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Victor.</speaker>
    <p> I to make observation—de little—annonce in de window—"Ici on parle Francais. "</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> French spoken here? oh, yes! oui, oui, oui! Ici on parle Francais—to be sure.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Victor.</speaker>
    <p> I tink it be von leetle hombogs, to attrape de etranger lodger. You no speak French at all,
     you stupid man.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(astounded—to his wife)</stage> What's he say ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p>He says you're a stupid man, and he isn't far out either!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(to Victor)</stage> You see I—I'm just a little out of practice.</p>

     before I've done with you.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
    <p> I should require a sitting room and bed room.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> The very thing, these two rooms on the right—<stage>(obsequiously)</stage>—we shall be
     delighted to accommodate you. We charge—a—a—four guineas a week, including attendance of the
     most zealous and devoted description, and—a—a—the view of the sea—a—a—la—la—ocean—comprenny

   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
    <p> Dear me, that's rather expensive.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, dear, no! Apartments always fetch more when, like ours, they are situated exactly
     opposite the bathing machines.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Victor.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(aside)</stage> De old hombogs, charge extra for de perspectif.</p>

    <p> <stage>(to Mrs. Spriggins)</stage> Well then, if you will have my luggage brought up, I will

     her)</stage></p>

    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> I'll run and draw up a little memorandum. <stage>(aside)</stage> Four guineas! What a fool I
     was not to ask more—I'm sure I might have had five—mounseer—au—au—<hi>reservoir</hi>.
     <stage>Exit,r. D. 1 E.</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(to Victor)</stage> And now, monsieur, permit me to return you my heartfelt thanks
     for the trouble you have taken in my behalf, during the short time we have been acquainted.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Victor.</speaker>
    <p> De plaisir to serve von so charmante lady is its own recompense.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
    <p> How provoking that I should have been so unexpectedly separated from my husband at the
     refreshment station— how vexed he will be.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Victor.</speaker>
    <p> Yes, de poor man, I see him to run—to run—to run after de train, but he not can to run so
     fast as de locomotif.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
    <p> What should I have done in this strange town without your polite assistance? I shall now
     just make a slight alteration in my dress, and go and wait at the station, until the next train
     arrives ; my husband will be sure to come down by it. <stage>(crosses to R.)</stage></p>

    <speaker>Victor.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(ecstatically)</stage> In love, helas ! I am in love all over de head, all over de

     I can't find it among the F's—but let me see now, four and three make seven—seven guineas a

    <p> Well, Mrs. Spriggins, what do you say to my scheme now ? I've let the little bed-room for

    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> Well, now, we are in a precious fix! I never thought the hussey really meant it. What the
     deuce are we to do? however, as far as our immediate requirements are concerned, I suppose
     there's no great mystery in broiling a beefsteak and making a cup of coffee ?</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(indignantly)</stage> What, sir, do you suppose that I, a distant descendant of the

     Never!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(submissively)</stage> Well, my dear, then I'll attend to the culinary

     <stage>(begins to brush boots with evident disgust—a ring heard, R.—she approaches door, and
     inquires with a violent attempt at a gracious manner)</stage> Did you please to ring,

    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> Dear me, what a fuss about a pair of stays! <stage>(as if making a violent sacrifice, and

     <pb n="12"/>Well, I suppose I must just give 'em a sort of a rough polish, <stage>(puts Anna
     Maria's apron on and begins brushing boots methodically-- calmly soliloquising)</stage> I'm not
     by any means what's called proud, not being a Fitz-Pentonville myself; but nevertheless, I'm
     fully prepared to admit that there are more fascinating occupations than boot blacking.
     <stage>(ring heard at back)</stage> Confound it, there's the street door bell!

    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p> Excited! I should think I was. I've come all the way from the last refreshment station on an

    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p> Don't interrupt me—I was on the point of informing you that I'm a retired Major, late of the

    <p> Having got tired of Zulu Kaffirs, and wild beast hunts, I sold out, returned to England, and
     in an unguarded moment, recently married a lovely young lady—the daughter of a brother
     officer.</p>

    <p> <stage>(aside)</stage> Now what the devil is all this to me?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p> Well, sir, wishing to give my wife a treat, I resolved upon spending a month with her at the
     sea-side; we started this morning per express: in the same carriage was a young fellow, one of
     those infernal, insinuating, foreign-looking dogs! On reaching the refreshment station, my wife
     complains of hunger—I rush from the train, and purchase three bath buns; no sooner had my wife
     tasted one of them, than she informs me she's thirsty.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> Well, there's nothing so very extraordinary in that!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, you think so, do you? Just wait a moment before you give your opinion. Well, sir,
     forgetting that the ten minutes had already expired, I return to the refreshment room, and was
     just compounding for a glass of sherry and water, when—zum! zum! zum! off goes the train, with
     my wife and the young Frenchman !</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
    <p> Dear me, how very vexatious; my husband appears merely to have stopped a few minutes at the
     hotel, and then to have gone out no one knows where. <stage>(observing their silence and
     constraint)</stage> But what's the matter with you all ? What do you all mean by staring at one
     another in this way.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(confused)</stage> I—I—I—don't feel exactly the thing.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
    <p> Has anything happened during my absence? <stage>(still
     <pb n="21"/>strict silence—to Spriggins)</stage> Has my husband been here again ? <stage>(no
     one answers)</stage> Have either of you seen him, I say?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> No!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p>No !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Victor.</speaker>
    <p> No !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
    <p> So much the better, <stage>(to Victor)</stage> for if he had found you here, monsieur,
     there's no knowing what might have happened.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(who repeatedly pops his head from behind curtains— —aside)</stage> So, she was
     anxious on the fellow's account; fire and fury!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(continuing)</stage> My poor husband is so dreadfully jealous. <stage>(to Mrs.
     Spriggins)</stage> If he had even seen the friendly shake of the hand which your husband gave
     me just now at the door—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(horribly alarmed)</stage> It's no such thing! I—I—I didn't give you a friendly
     anything! <stage>(aside—writhing)</stage> I'm certain the monster is taking deliberate aim at
     me between the shoulders.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(appears surprised at Spriggins' manner, but continues)</stage> I'm sure you,
     monsieur, <stage>(addressing Victor)</stage> must have noticed how fiercely he glared at you in
     the train, every time you happened to look my way. <stage>(Victor says nothing, but nods his
     head violently)</stage> I do believe—ha, ha, ha! I do believe he was jealous of you—of you who
     confess that you are dying in love with the young lady you met at a ball in Paris.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(aside, popping his head from between curtains)</stage> A young lady—ball—Paris ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(continuing)</stage> A young lady to whom you must indeed be deeply attached, since
     you have journeyed to this town for the sole purpose of seeking after her.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(aside)</stage> What's that she says ? <stage>(rushes violently towards Victor, and
     as he does so, drags down curtains)</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(extremely astonished)</stage> My husband ! </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mrs. S.|Sprig. </speaker>
    <p><stage>(in agony)</stage> The curtains!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(stumbling over curtains)</stage> Confound your curtains! <stage>(throws them away—to
     Victor eagerly)</stage> Is it really true that you are in love with somebody else ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Victor.</speaker>
    <p> Vat you mean, sare?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> To be sure he is—the somebody in question happens to be my daughter.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p> Your daughter? why, you never told me you had a daughter! Produce her! produce your
     daughter, sir!</p>
    <stage>Enter Angelina, R. 1 E., during the last words.</stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p>Here she comes!</p>
    <pb n="22"/>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p> Hem ! Ah ! nice looking girl, not in the least like her father. <stage>(to
     Angelina—impressively)</stage> Young woman, is this seductive foreigner in love with you?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Angel.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(glancing archly at Victor)</stage> At any rate, he says so!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Victor.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(rapturously approaching her)</stage> And he mean it, too —and once more,
     <stage>(turning to Spriggins)</stage> my dear old gentlemans, I pray you to accord to me se
     hand of your charmante female shild ; my father, he vere rich—Dubois et Compagnie, Rue Saint
     Lazare, Paris.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Major.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(hastily)</stage> Dubois and Co., Rue St. Lazare—bless my soul—know the firm well—got
     a house out at the Cape! <stage>(aside)</stage> By Jove then, I've been making an ass of myself
     all this time ! <stage>(abruptly)</stage> Take her, young man—she's yours! <stage>(handing
     Angelina to Victor—pathetically)</stage> Bless you, my children !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(hastily)</stage> Hallo! there—not quite so fast—as I'm only the young lady's father,
     allow me to have some share in the matter ! Mrs. S. and I must talk the matter over, and if,
     upon inquiry, I find Mr. Dubois' description of himself to be correct, I see no reason why we
     shouldn't accept him as our son-in-law.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Victor.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(kissing Angelina's hand)</stage> Oh, bonheur !</p>
    <stage>Enter Anna Maria, C. from L., with bonnet and shawl on.</stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Anna.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(with great dignity)</stage> Please to pay me my wages, and to examine my box, for my
     cousin, the policeman, has called to fetch it away.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> My good girl, we'll see about all that presently—Mrs. Spriggins, you were perfectly right—If
     ever I speculate again, I'll take precious good care it shan't be on my own premises, and, for
     the future, my only method of "letting lodgings," will be to "let lodgings alone!"'</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Anna.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(eagerly)</stage> Let lodgings alone! then I resumes my place. <stage>(takes off
     bonnet and shawl)</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
    <p> Thankee! <stage>(continuing)</stage> And as for French, my dear, I give up all idea of it,
     whether before or after breakfast, for although my pretensions to that language have brought me
     a son in-law, I am firmly convinced I shall never have it in my power conscientiously to
     say—<stage>(tapping himself on the forehead)</stage> "Ici on parle Francais !"</p>
