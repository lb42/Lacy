<sp who="#L0849_M5">
<speaker>Bibbles.</speaker>
<p>Bubbles, I caught you at it</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M6">
<speaker>Bubbles.</speaker>
<p>I didn't go to do it, Mr. Bibbles.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M5">
<speaker>Bibbles.</speaker>
<p>You did go to do it, Bubbles; you went into my private apartment and you —
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M6">
<speaker>Bubbles.</speaker>
<p>I went to put it to rights, Mr. Bibbles.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M5">
<speaker>Bibbles.</speaker>
<p>And now I've got you to rights, Bubbles. I saw you take up a decanter, fill a
glass, and drink it.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M6">
<speaker>Bubbles.</speaker>
<p>Drink the glass, Mr. Bibbles ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M5">
<speaker>Bibbles.</speaker>
<p>No evasion, Bubbles. I say, you -</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M6">
<speaker>Bubbles.</speaker>
<p>I was taken suddenly so very faint.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M5">
<speaker>Bibbles.</speaker>
<p>es. You might have felt faint, but you smelt very strong of Sir Michael's
choicest port.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M6">
<speaker>Bubbles.</speaker>
<p>Oh ! I wish I was a butler, that I might drink as much as you do.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M5">
<speaker>Bibbles.</speaker>
<p>You a butler! never hope to arrive at that dignified station ; a butler is
expected to be a man of noble bearing and commanding figure—a butler is expected
to be a man—that is, in short, such a man as I am!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M6">
<speaker>Bubbles.</speaker>
<p>Then they must be very hard to get, for I never saw such a man as you are in
all my life —</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M5">
<speaker>Bibbles.</speaker>
<p><stage>(conceitedly)</stage> I am glad, Bubbles, you have sufficient
discernment to do me justice.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M6">
<speaker>Bubbles.</speaker>
<p>And I hope I never shall again! such a pompous, domineering —</p>

<speaker>Bibbles.</speaker>
<p>Bubbles!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M6">
<speaker>Bubbles.</speaker>
<p>Conceited, inflated, stuck up —</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M5">
<speaker>Bibbles.</speaker>
<p>Bubbles !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M6">
<speaker>Bubbles.</speaker>
<p>My indignation will have vent, I can't bottle it up any longer, I will
speak.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M5">
<speaker>Bibbles.</speaker>
<p>You do, and your speech is very thick ; and it isn't your indignation that is
speaking—it's Sir Michael's old port! Bubbles, you took more than one glass
!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M6">
<speaker>Bubbles.</speaker>
<p>One glass was all I took.</p>
<pb n="5"/>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M5">
<speaker>Bibbles.</speaker>
<p>You swear it?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M6">
<speaker>Bubbles.</speaker>
<p>Yes, one glass of port—that's all—and four glasses of brandy !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M5">
<speaker>Bibbles.</speaker>
<p><stage>(starting)</stage> Horrible! the brandy that I keep for my own
drinking! I might have forgiven you for drinking Sir Michael's port, but to
presume to swallow my brandy—my own private bottle of —</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M6">
<speaker>Bubbles.</speaker>
<p>I didn't swallow the bottle—and, if anybody says I did, it's a lie !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M5">
<speaker>Bibbles.</speaker>
<p>Hitherto unheard of ruffian, you are discharged !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M6">
<speaker>Bubbles.</speaker>
<p>What does that matter to such a smart young man as I am! I shall make it my
business to obtain a situation with a lovely young lady with large property, and
she'll fall in love with me and marry me!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M5">
<speaker>Bibbles.</speaker>
<p>If she did, she'd be sent to pass the honeymoon in a lunatic asylum! Bubbles,
you are discharged—I give you warning.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M6">
<speaker>Bubbles.</speaker>
<p>You are jealous of me with Phœbe Marks, that's it!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M5">
<speaker>Bibbles.</speaker>
<p>Jealous of <hi>you</hi> ! Do you imagine Phœbe would cast a look on an
undersized footman when there is a full grown butler in the way?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M6">
<speaker>Bubbles.</speaker>
<p>Yes, you <hi>are</hi> in the way!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M5">
<speaker>Bibbles.</speaker>
<p>Phœbe Marks is Lady Audley's own maid, and a great favourite with her
mistress, receiving, besides her liberal salary, handsome presents from her
ladyship; in short, Phœbe is a charming creature!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M6">
<speaker>Bubbles.</speaker>
<p>Well, and so am I; so it would be a capital match.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M5">
<speaker>Bibbles.</speaker>
<p>Bubbles, you are a little man ; and as I am tall and powerful, of course I
can't be such a coward as to strike you—so, there! <stage>(kicks
him)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M6">
<speaker>Bubbles.</speaker>
<p>Oh ! why, surely you didn't dare to —</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M5">
<speaker>Bibbles.</speaker>
<p><stage>(hiding him again)</stage> Yes, I did !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M6">
<speaker>Bubbles.</speaker>
<p>Oh! I'll take you before a magistrate.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M5">
<speaker>Bibbles.</speaker>
<p>You've got no witnesses.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M6">
<speaker>Bubbles.</speaker>
<p>Yes I have! I'll show my bruises.</p>
</sp>

<stage>Enter Luke Marks, R.</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M4">
<speaker>Luke.</speaker>
<p>They let me in directly I asked for Phœbe Marks, and said I were her cousin,
it shows that she be somebody; but now I am here, how be I to find her in this
great rambling house?</p>
<stage>Enter Phœbe Marks, L.</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_F9">
<speaker>Phœbe.</speaker>
<p>You need not search far, Luke, for here I am.</p>
<pb n="6"/>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M4">
<speaker>Luke.</speaker>
<p>Ah! you didn't come to look after me, so I thought I'd best see after you. I
come across through the fields, and in at the gate agen the moat, and up to the
back door of the house.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_F9">
<speaker>Phœbe.</speaker>
<p>1 can see the well from my bed room window, and happening to be at that
window I saw you approaching, and immediately hurried to meet you, for we were,
you know, playmates in childhood, and now are sweethearts.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M4">
<speaker>Luke.</speaker>
<p>Yes, and we are bound to marry one another, you know.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_F9">
<speaker>Phœbe.</speaker>
<p><stage>(rather sadly)</stage> Yes—yes.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M4">
<speaker>Luke.</speaker>
<p>You don't seem over pleased about it?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_F9">
<speaker>Phœbe.</speaker>
<p><stage>(quickly)</stage> Oh, yes, indeed ! But—I was just wishing that I were
a great lady like —</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M4">
<speaker>Luke.</speaker>
<p>Like your missus, eh ? But 'taint every poor girl, merely because she happens
to have been born pretty, that is lucky enough to find an old fool of a rich
baronet to fall in love with and marry her.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_F9">
<speaker>Phœbe.</speaker>
<p>And Sir Michael perfectly doats on her; she has just as much money as she
chooses to ask for.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M4">
<speaker>Luke.</speaker>
<p>Ay, it's a fine thing, Phœbe, to have lots of money, and I hope you'll be
warned by that, my lass, to save up your wages agen we get married.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_F9">
<speaker>Phœbe.</speaker>
<p>And what was Miss Graham, now Lady Audley, only three months ago, when she
lived in Mr. Dawson's house? nothing but a governess, a servant like me, taking
small wages, and working for them as hard, or harder than I did. You should have
seen her shabby clothes, Luke, worn and patched, and turned and twisted, yet
always looking nice upon her somehow, and now she is a great lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M4">
<speaker>Luke.</speaker>
<p>Never you mind her, take care of yourself, Phœbe! that's all you've got to
do. What should you say to a public house for you and me by-and-by my girl ?
There's a deal of money to be made out of a public house.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_F9">
<speaker>Phœbe.</speaker>
<p>Unless it happens to be a losing speculation, <stage>(aside)</stage> Oh,
dear! and I've got to marry this man !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M4">
<speaker>Luke.</speaker>
<p>And I should think you'd soon get tired of this mortal dull place—I've heard
tell of a murder that was done here in old times.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_F9">
<speaker>Phœbe.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Luke! don't talk like that, or I shall fancy I see a ghost in every dark
comer of the old house—<stage>(bell rings)</stage> hark 1 there is Lady Audley
ringing for me—-you must go now, Luke, but I shall see you again soon.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M4">
<speaker>Luke.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes, you go to her ladyship, stick close to her, and seem very fond of
her; because the more you can, get out of her, the better I shall like you, you
know.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_F9">
<speaker>Phœbe.</speaker>
<p><stage>(aside)</stage> Thinks only of what I may bring him, and I dare'nt say
I won't have him; oh, dear! <stage>Exit, L.</stage></p>

</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M4">
<speaker>Luke.</speaker>
<p>Phœbe's getting quite a fine lady here; but I'll soon cure her of that
complaint arter she's my wife. Let's see, which way did I come in,

<p>Enter Bibbles and Bubbles, L.</p>

<speaker>Robert.</speaker>
<p>-Well, George, here we are, arrived at last at my brave old uncle's mansion,
and though I did not say in my letter to him that I should bring you with me,
as, indeed, how could I ? for I did not so unexpectedly run against you till the
day after that letter was written, yet for all that, I say I can promise you a
hearty welcome from Sir Michael Audley; and his young wife cannot, so soon,
prove otherwise than amiable, for, as I have already told you, my uncle has
lately married, for the second time, with a mere girl, as young almost, or
quite, as his daughter by his first marriage; but <stage>(looking at
George)</stage> all my chattering is thrown away upon you, there you stand as
gloomy and as sad ——</p>

</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M2">
<speaker>Robert.</speaker>
<p><stage>(L. C.)</stage> Because I saw you so wretched, I feared to leave you
to your own company. George, George, we were fast friends in early youth! 1 lose
sight of you for years, and suddenly we meet again—you appear to me the same as
of old, except that foreign suns have rather bronzed your features— we enter an
hotel together—you carelessly take up a news paper, and the next instant—George,
what there did you read, what could you read? nothing that could affect the
fortune you have earned? <stage>(George shakes his head sadly)</stage> Well
whatever your grief, will you endure it alone ? think you that my friendship is
a mere word—that in name only has existence ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M3">

<p><stage>(crosses to L.)</stage> Well, since you will have it so, know that
when you saw me sitting rigid as a statue, and as pale, before that newspaper,

<p>Heavens ! my poor friend, I—I did not mean that you —</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M3">
<speaker>Talboys.</speaker>
<p><stage>(rising)</stage> Mine was a romantic, a hasty marriage— ours was
indeed love at first sight. We went to Italy. You know I was never a niggard
with my money; I had but two thousand pounds bequeathed me by my father—well we
lived in splendid style so long as it lasted; when but a couple of hundred or so
were left, we returned to England, to the little watering place which had ever
been my dear one's home; and soon we were almost penniless, but I had no fear of
the future, believing that I had influence which would obtain for me a lucrative
appointment.</p>

<speaker>Robert.</speaker>
<p>And did it not ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M3">
<speaker>Talboys.</speaker>
<p>I could obtain nothing, and when tired out and down-hearted, I returned to my
wife, and told her that I had failed in everything, she burst into a storm of
sobs and lamentations, telling me that I ought not to have married her if I
could give her nothing but poverty and misery, and that I had done her a cruel
wrong in making her my wife.</p>
<p>Robert, <stage>(surprised)</stage> Did she tell you that ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M3">
<speaker>Talboys.</speaker>
<p>By heavens, Robert ! her tears and reproaches drove me almost mad, and I
rushed from the house, declaring that I would never enter it again.</p>

<sp who="#L0849_M2">
<speaker>Robert.</speaker>
<p>Well?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M3">
<speaker>Talboys.</speaker>
<p>Well, I flew into the open country, and there dashed myself despairingly on
the ground, after a while I grew calmer and could think, and suddenly I
remembered that in India I had a relative, a wealthy merchant, and I resolved to
go to him; I wrote a few brief lines to my wife which told her that I never had
loved her better than now when I seemed to desert her; that I was going far from
her to try my fortune, and that if I succeeded I should come back to bring her
plenty and happiness, but that if I failed I should never look upon her face
again. I did not leave her to hopeless poverty, for she had still her jewels,
her trinkets, while I—but, no matter, no matter now </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M2">
<speaker>Robert.</speaker>
<p>And in India, you succeeded ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M3">
<speaker>Talboys.</speaker>
<p>Not till I had long despaired of success, for the relative to whom I went was
a hard man, and made of me one of his clerks—with the poor wages of a clerk,
that was all; but was'nt I toiling for my darling ? Through all that dreary <pb n="10"/>time, her pretty white hand beckoned me onwards to a happy future. Why,
I have seen her sitting by my side, as plainly as I had ever seen her in the one
happy year of our wedded life and so I toiled on steadily, and at last I
conquered.</p>

<sp who="#L0849_M2">
<speaker>Robert.</speaker>
<p>Brave fellow !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M3">
<speaker>Talboys.</speaker>
<p>With the little money which I had saved, I commenced to speculate on my own
account, fortune attended my every venture, and at last I awoke one morning to
find myself with twenty thousand pounds, and more—and a week after was on board
a vessel to return to England, and as I madly believed, to the darling of my
life.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M2">
<speaker>Robert.</speaker>
<p>But in all that time did vou never write to your wife?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M3">
<speaker>Talboys.</speaker>
<p>Never, till a week before the vessel set sail; I waited for good fortune, and
when that came, I wrote, telling her that I should be in England almost as soon
as my letter, and giving her an address where to find me—and I returned, as I
hoped and believed, to her love and to a life's happiness, and I find her dead.

<p>Poor George ! how he grieves; and yet, judging her by his own report, she
could not have been a very devoted wife, nor have loved him much, as it appears
to me ; but then, of course, I know nothing about it, for I am not a married

put off the evil time as long as possible.</p>

<p>A touch! Sir, I have got enough of it to knock me down!</p>

<stage>(raising his voice)</stage> Rascal! <stage>Exit Bibbles, bowing,
R.</stage> I suppose it is thus that all will judge me ; but have I ever thought
of, or cared about my uncle's fortune ? Not I, indeed ; I have enough of my own,
even should I marry, and I suppose that some day I must marry my cousin Alicia.
It might seem to others that the partiality of a young lady who is sole heiress
to a very fine estate is rather well worth cultivating, but it doesn't so occur
to me. Alicia is a very nice girl, a jolly bouncing girl, with no nonsense about
her—a girl of a thousand; <pb n="12"/>but my enthusiasm will carry me no farther
at present. Hem! here she is; <stage>(to Alicia as she enters, L.)</stage> My

</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M2">
<speaker>Robert.</speaker>
<p> (laughing) I didn't suppose you would, and, no doubt, you and my lady, your

unpleasant things to each other at the dinner table—rows always upset a man's
digestion.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_F8">
<speaker>Alicia.</speaker>
<p>I don't like her; shouldn't, I think, if she were not my stepmother ? I don't
like her eyes—something strange and sinister in their expression, I think !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M2">
<speaker>Robert.</speaker>
<p>Well, when I have seen her I will tell you.</p>

<p>Listen to me. After your departure, I vainly sought employment—a wife whom
her husband had deserted could not be innocent of all fault—and no one would
receive me as the instructress of their children, I was penniless-
helpless—hopeless; before me was starvation or a repulsive life of infamy! I
shrunk from both and resolved to live anew, and for myself alone. I ceased to be
Mrs. George Talboys, forgot even that I had ever been Helen Maldon, and became
Miss Lucy Graham. For a miserable stipend I toiled as a governess, was seen,
admired, and loved by Sir Michael Audley, he offered me his hand, weary of
poverty and drudgery, fixed in the belief that you would never return to claim
me, I became Sir Michael's wife.</p>

<p>Scarcely was I married when your letter reached me, it told me you were about
to quit India, named the time when I might expect once more to behold you. What
did I then ? not groan and tear my hair, no ! I hastened to my birthplace, I
knew that there, a young girl, a playmate of my childhood, was dying rapidly of
consumption. She did die. Her mother for a heavy bribe, consented that the girl
should be buried in my name. I then caused to be inserted in the papers the
announcement of my own death, and if you have visited the grave, you have seen
the words, "Helen Talboys," written on its tombstone.</p>

to enter those gardens, but he was never seen to leave them—I do not believe
that he ever did leave. I believe that he met with his death within the boundary
of those grounds, and that his bodv lies hidden below some quiet water, or in
some forgotten corner of that place. I will have such a search made as shall
level this house to the earth, and root up every tree in those gardens, rather

your heart on a charming creature, who, receiving besides — </p>

<p>Yes, I know,but there are other charming creatures who having been careful of
their wages and perquisites, have a nice little bit of money.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0849_M5">
<speaker>Bibbles.</speaker>
<p>I don't care about money, but such a man as I am ought not to go to any woman
for nothing; and when I hear of sensible females who have saved some money, I
always wish that I could marry them all, and take them and their property in a
lump. But where find these charming creatures ?</p>

<p>Never I what do I care for the poor burnt-out wretch ? My grief for her loss
was all a pretence, because my manly pride could not endure that you should
behold a love I feared you could never requite.</p>

<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>I cannot hear any more of this terrible secret which, now revealed to me,
must embitter all the years yet left to me. Robert, you will not act too harshly
with her whom I have thought—my wife. You will remember in all you do, that I
have loved her very dearly and truly. I cannot say farewell to her. I can but
pity her, as I now pray that heaven may pity her. <stage>(going slowly,

you have been very good to me; but I can't, I can't. I can feel nothing but my
own misery. I have ever been selfish, now more selfish than ever in my misery.
Happy, prosperous people may feel for others — I laugh at other people's
sufferings, they seem so small compared to my own. <stage>(Sir Michael goes

<p>Ah! but you shall not take me to a madhouse— I will not be buried while yet
alive—I would laugh at you and defy you if I dared. I would kill myself and defy
you if I dared. But I am a poor pitiful coward, and have been so from the first,
afraid of my mother's horrible inheritance, afraid of poverty, afraid of George

horribly to obtain.</p>
