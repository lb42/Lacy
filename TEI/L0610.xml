    <p><stage> (occupied arranging the toilet table)</stage>What a temper my lady is
in to-day! No possibility of cheering her! To be sure, what is a poor widow
to do? Without her opportunities for coquetry, she is no better than a judge
without a wig—a soldier without his red coat—or a fool without his cap and
bauble—a senseless and insipid thing! Ah, here she is!<stage>Enter Lady
    Amaranthe Allwill, R.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (going to sit at the toilet table)</stage>Ah! there you are,
Perkup!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Perkup.</speaker>
    <p>Yes, your la'ship!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Have any of my despairing lovers called to-day?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Perkup.</speaker>
    <p>Let me see. <hi>Inprims</hi>, Lord Arthur Bramble.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>To see whether I was not engaged in a flirtation before cock crow, I suppose.
There's nothing so insupportable as a jealous lover. He gives himself all
the tyrannical airs of a husband, and deserves to be treated
accordingly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Perkup.</speaker>
    <p><hi>In seconds,</hi> Sir Basil Bodkin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>As a disappointed courtier he can afford to wait. No other?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Perkup.</speaker>
    <p>Is your la'ship expecting any one?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>No one. I don't mean to be visible to-day; my vapours are getting as thick as
a November fog—to not a soul. <stage>(with hesitation)</stage> Only, if
that, that—what's his name?—that Mr. Frankland should call—the young
painter—you know— about my portrait, let him come in. I might give him a
sitting.   Heigho!</p>
</sp>
    <pb n="4"/>    <sp>
    <speaker>Perkup.</speaker>
    <p>Yes, your la'ship! <stage>(aside)</stage> Hum! has the young painter touched
up my lady's fickle heart? <stage>(aloud)</stage> I think I hear voices in
the ante-room—shall I see, your la'ship? <stage>(going to C. D., and looking
    out)</stage> Lawks! if it isn't Mr. Frankland himself!</p>
</sp>
  
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (with suppressed satisfaction)</stage>Ah!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Perkup.</speaker>
    <p>Shall I tell Taggs to let him in?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>That head of yours has about the value of one of your toilet pins, Perkup!
Didn't I say so, already? Admit him! Stay! I'll give an eye to my attire in
my room—I don't want to look quite a fright—on account of this tiresome
sitting! <stage>(aside, going R.)</stage> Ah! he has come,
    then!<stage>                                        Exit R.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Perkup.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (going, C. D.)</stage>Walk in, sir! <stage>Enter Sir Aubrey
    Glenmorris, simply dressed.</stage> Her la'ship will attend on you
immediately! <stage>(aside, after examining him—pertly, going)</stage> Well!
I must say for her la'ship's taste, he does look more like a pictur' than a
    pictur'-dauber!<stage>                                        Exit
    R.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (suddenly changing his simple manner to that of a man of fashion, and
    flinging himself into a chair)</stage>'Fore gad! I hope she won't leave
me long alone, or I shall be forced to a <hi>tête-à-tête</hi> with my own
conscience. And that same vixen conscience might be after telling me a host
of wicked truths, such as “Sir Aubrey Glenmorris, you are a confounded rake,
for you are blessed with a wife of your own—or cursed!”—conscience is not
quite clear on that point, “and you leave her to vegetate amidst turnip tops
and cabbages, while you—the fine gentleman   in town—make love to a
provoking. <hi>piquante</hi>, seductive widow! Sir Aubrey, you are a cheat
and a swindler! for, lest your beauty should discover that you are a married
man, and your court but little honorable, you sneak into her house under a
false name and disguised mien! Sir Aubrey, you are a scoundrel, for—”
Prithee, Madam Conscience, hold your peace! You are as cantankerous a
tattler as a disappointed old maid! and I will have none of your company!
Ah! I think I hear the widow coming!</p>
</sp><stage>Enter Lady Amaranthe, R., with
    Perkup—Lady Amaranthe and Sir Aubrey curtsey and bow, with
    formality.</stage>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>I must not be disturbed in my sitting, Perkup! This picture must be a
secret—a secret! D'ye hear?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Perkup.</speaker>
    <p>La! your la'ship need not say it twice. We poor girls are bred to our trade
of secrecy, though it is harder work than you may think; for there's mighty
little distance from the ear to the
    mouth!<stage>                                        Exit C.</stage></p>

<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p>At last, my dear Lady Amaranthe, I see you again. Had you known my
impatience—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>I should have valued it at a low brokerage, probably!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p>You're vexed—you expected me, then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Vexed! Expected you, indeed! Your vanity, at least, I see I must put at a
high figure!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p>I was prevented leaving home by a tiresome intruder, whom I longed to fling
out of my window! <stage>(aside)</stage> Only as it was my wife's uncle, I
couldn't in decency.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>  Fie, Mr. Frankland! I thought you a man of spirit; but if you have no
better entertainment than your domestic affairs, I might as well submit to a
    <hi>tête-à-tête</hi> with old Mrs. Fondlechit!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p>Nay, then, if I am pressing, 'tis you provoke me to it!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>I provoke you to be pressing? Oh, the impertinent—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p>Yes! you give me my diploma to profess what conversation I please! Mine shall
be of my ardour—my adoration —my burning heart—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Stop, stop! or I shall call “fire!” Your heart. indeed! I'll wager now, 'tis
like some of your Spanish wines with never a flavour at all, till it gets a
fine fiery taste by its transport over the tongue!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p>Cruel woman! You know my heart is weak! 'Tis in your hands, and 'twere a want
of generosity to crush it!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Out on you! Why, your male hearts always get stronger and sounder by plenty
of hard work, than they would by gentle nourishment! Well! you may talk of
your heart, if you promise not to talk nonsense—but that's impossible! And
so, on second thoughts, I forbid the conversation. Well, don't pout! and you
shall talk of it—but not until you have finished my portrait! Now, this is
at least the tenth sitting I have given you, or verily, I believe the
baker's dozen—and not a stroke have you made, idler!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (aside)</stage>And for very good reasons, I don't know how   to hold
a pencil!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Take your portfolio, and make something passably handsome of me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p>Make! What have I to make, when your own charms—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Hush, hush! Not a word until my portrait is completed —I'm called a horrid
tyrant! Well then, there's my ultimatum!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p>Tyranny indeed! 'Tis monstrous—barbarous!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>I hate pouting, it spoils the face! Come, I'm waiting!</p>
</sp>
<pb n="6"/>     <sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p>Your pardon, madam! I decline painting your portrait!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Is the man mad? Why does he refuse?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (sulkily)</stage>Why, because—because I don't choose—not but that I
am as capable as another of—certainly I am—but—
    but—<stage>(tenderly)</stage>—where is the painter who could flatter
himself ever to reproduce that beauty? Those eyes at once so full of
softness and provoking malice—that intoxicating smile—that lovely mouth,
every pearl of wit falling from which must be seized to give its true
expression—those hands—that form—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Stop, for mercy's sake! I am out of blushes, if you are not out of
breath!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p>'Tis a task beyond human power, and the first moment I saw you my poor talent
was gone for ever—my art forgotten   —my sole thought the desire to be
admitted into your house— my whole life devoted to dying at your feet!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Ha, ha, ha! A pretty life's occupation! But you are not dead yet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p>But I shall be soon, to see you bestow your smiles on the hundred male flirts
who flutter around you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>A hundred! Flatterer! But a poor twenty at most! And such as they are too!
Even the half of the wretched score count for nothing! Besides, they tell me
I have not got a heart!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p>A too capacious one, perhaps—but give in it a place for one who—<stage>(about
    to kneel)</stage></p></sp><stage>Enter Perkup, C. D.</stage>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Hush! <stage>(aloud)</stage> You must find another attitude for me, Mr.
Frankland—there's something too constrained in that!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (aside)</stage>The coquette—but she was touched!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Well, Perkup, did I not order you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Perkup.</speaker>
    <p>Your la'ship certainly did—but your la'ship has given me full powers, if your
la'ship pleases to remember, to transgress orders, according to the
imperiosity of circumstances.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Heaven help us! the girl talks like a Minister of State, called to account by
the Commons! What is it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Perkup.</speaker>
    <p>It is a lady urgently desires to see your la'ship alone, and will not be
refused. I tried on the vapours, your la'ship; but that's no excuse for one
of our own sex, as your la'ship knows.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>  Did she give her name?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Perkup.</speaker>
    <p>She said your la'ship was probably ignorant of her present
    <hi>appellation</hi>!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>How does she look?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Perkup.</speaker>
    <p>She wears a travelling mask, your la'ship—but her tongue wags more like a
lady's than a—</p>

    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Than a waiting woman's—good! My curiosity is piqued—Mr. Frankland, you must
excuse me! Where curiosity is in the case, the male sex must give place, you
know. Mr. Frankland, our sitting is dissolved. <stage>(curtsies)</stage>
Perkup, admit this strange
    visitor!<stage>                                        Exit Perkup, C.
    D.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p>But tell me when I may return?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Well! my afternoon's reception is open to all the world!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p>And I am to be treated like all the world?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Presumption! of course. What would the man have next? A good day, sir!
    <stage>(Sir Aubrey bows, piqued, and goes C. D.)</stage> No, no! by
yonder suite of rooms! <stage>(points L.)</stage> And the other stair—there,
go! <stage>(Sir Aubrey lingers—she holds out her hand—he kisses it)</stage>
How you mumble! <stage>(pulls away her hand)</stage> I vow I am a great deal
too good to you—not a word!</p>

    <p><stage> (looking after him)</stage>I must confess that the wretch is
charming—fascinating in manner—in look—in language! Is   it possible I can
have any regard for a young man without name or fortune, surrounded by a
certain mystery? And then, poor Lord Arthur—ah! I begin to believe that I
    <hi>have</hi> a heart; for I tremble to ask it a serious question.
Pshaw! away the thought now!</p></sp><stage>Perkup introduces Lady Glenmorris, C.—she

    <p><stage> (taking off her mask)</stage>Amaranthe!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Mabel! Mabel Templeton! the companion of my childhood—my old friend whom, for
many years I have lost sight of! Welcome! welcome!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>Yes—I am she—in all but name!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>You are married?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>To Sir Aubrey Glenmorris!</p>
</sp>
<pb n="8"/>   <sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Sir Aubrey Glenmorris? Stay! surely I know the name—but I certainly have
never seen him—and is he young— handsome?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>Yes—young and handsome!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>  And are you very happy, sweetheart?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (hiding her face in her handkerchief)</stage>Oh! Amaranthe!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Ah! I see! another poor connubial victim! Oh, those vile monsters of men!
Come, calm yourself, my dear! Sit down here, and tell me all about it—you
don't know the good it will do you! <stage>(leads Lady Glenmorris to a
    sofa)</stage> I'll wager all my courtly adorers to one bumpkin, now, it
was a love match!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>Yes! and at first my husband lived only for me, and I was so, so happy, alone
with him in the country—always alone! I devoted myself to him—refused to see
a single importunate visitor!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Oh, I see! Dear, dear, dear! This is to be a confession of mistakes!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>How a mistake, when I did all to please him? But, in a little time—I don't
know how—he grew weary— sulky—pouted—and when I asked him why, actually
quarrelled with me! I cried—he scolded—at last I lost patience—overwhelmed
him with reproaches—and what do you think he did?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Left you, and came off to town!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>Yes! where, for three long months he has only written to me once, and then to
propose an eternal separation. But I answered that I loved him still—should
always, always, always love him, and never would consent—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>I thought so—another awful error!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>  Do you think so? But how did you know this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>I guessed it only! My dear, they are all alike! On the matrimonial field as
soon as the woman shows fight, the man deserts his colours! And so you've
followed him to town?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>Oh, but in secret! I would not have him know the step I have taken for the
world!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>That's right, my love, try a little deceit with him —you have been too open
hearted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>That's what uncle Templeton said. He wrote to tell me that my wicked husband
was making love to some horrid vile coquette, whose name he had not learned.
“Had you been a coquette yourself,” he added, “you might have entered the
field against this woman; but you know nothing of the art—the more's the
pity—for it ought to form a notable part of a girl's education.”</p>
</sp>
<pb n="9"/>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>As I live, your uncle Templeton is a man of uncommon good sense.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>His words gave me a new idea, a very extravagant one, I fear. I thought if
any one could but teach me the art of coquetry—show me how to lure him back
from my terrible rival—regain his tenderness! A woman is never too old to
learn.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Not <hi>that</hi> art, my love!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>I have heard that my former friend, Lady Amaranthe, was a widow, and that she
was cited in the world as—   as—oh, pardon me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (laughing)</stage>As a professed coquette! And you journed to town to
take lessons of me? Ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>I feared to anger you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>

were to believe all those odious men swear to me, which, thank my stars, I
don't!</p>

    <p>And is there none you love?</p>

    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>You must find some other way. That's too difficult.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (changing her manner)</stage>Why, make believe, then, sweetheart. Are
you a woman and cannot dissemble? Look ye, my love, men only value what they
have not, or what they are like to lose—let them doubt of their possession,
and they will first try to hold it. The fish will swim round and round the
still bait, look at it, and turn tail with contempt; but withdraw it gently,
and he'll snap at it, and swallow it, hook and all.</p>

    <p><stage> (puzzled)</stage>Oh! ah!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>You did wrong to shut yourself up alone. You should have seen
company—attracted gallants around you. There's no lack of game, love. Never
mind on whose coveys you poach. 'Tis a first general rule; you embrace your
dearest friend, and you carry off her lover—every day practice dear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>But if your admirers should become too ardent?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Oh! there are a thousand means to keep them in their place—a disdainful
silence, or a burst of laughter, a sudden attack of the vapours, or the
spasms—tears or swoonings, as a last resort.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>  Oh, dear! oh, dear! But that's shockingly complicated. How ever can I get
all this into my poor head?</p>

<pb n="11"/> <sp>

is better than precept. Ha, ha, ha! I verily grow an old professor in

child. Tell my fellows that I'll see the world to-day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Perkup.</speaker>
    <p>Your la'ship is most <hi>appoppos</hi> in all your la'ship does. For there's
Lord Arthur Bramble without, a tearing and a swearing—saving your la'ships
presence—and a threatening to rounce all your lacqueys. I verily thought,
your la'ship, he'd have spitted 'em all on his sword, like a row of larks
for roasting. Poor Taggs was nigh swooning outright—I'll give you my life he
was, your la'ship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

    <p>Well! we'll save poor Taggs's life by seeing Lord Arthur.

Oh, lud what's the matter with the man? He does it as natural as life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Bramble.</speaker>
    <p>  What's the matter with me! lost patience is the matter. Twice I have
presented myself, a humble suppliant, at the door of lady Aramanthe Allwill,

    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>How?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>

desired was a peaceful retreat.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>As a proof of which you never were at home.</p>

    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p>Because you made that home insupportable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>Because you had the vilest of tempers, and rendered me wretched with your
tyranny.</p>

    <p>Well, no matter now, sweetheart—the harm is   small.</p>

    <p>You will contrive to see him again, then—alone?</p>

</sp>
<sp>

him—and then I'll leave you.</p>

    <p>What can she mean to do? I am lost in a chaos of doubt. But the spirit of
vengeance is aroused in me, and I'll fight to the last, for the good of
humanity—in the cause of neglected wives. I'll coquette with the whole male
race—It's so amusing to see them dying before one! But, no, no! let me learn
the strategy of the coquette in self-defence—not as a means of heartless
attack. Ah, Lord Arthur!<stage>Enter Lord Arthur Bramble, C. D.</stage></p>

    <p>Alone, fairest! Exquisite opportunity!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>I expected you, my lord. I have not the art of your town coquettes—I am frank
and straitforward; and I will avow to you a truth, which, doubtless, you are
unaccustomed to learn.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Bramble.</speaker>
    <p>No, no—I am tolerably accustomed to such things. You would avow to me
that—</p>

    <p>That I can never love you.</p>

</sp>
<sp>

    <p>I admit your powers of pleasing—but a previous affection—deep as it is
unhappy—absorbs my every feeling.</p>
</sp>

    <speaker>Bramble.</speaker>
    <p>Enough—enough, madam. Certainly, I had fancied that—in fact—but I have the
honour of wishing you a very good day. <stage>(going)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>  Do not leave me thus. Affection for another excludes neither friendship or
interest. I will be frank again— you love Lady Amaranthe.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

    <p>I own it. My heart—my true, real, genuine heart is hers. But she does not
love me.</p>

    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (laughing)</stage>Ha, ha, ha! right or wrong, she fears to confide to
you her future welfare; and, although she loves you, might listen to the
proposals of another, who designs, it seems, to profit by this masquerade to
lure her into his clutches.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Bramble.</speaker>
    <p>But what would you have me do?</p>
</sp>

temper—</p>

    <p>So it seems.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Bramble.</speaker>
    <p>Well, no—you are right. I <hi>will</hi> moderate my temper—and marriage is a
wonderful sedative. You shall see how I shall calm down when she is mine.

    <p><stage> (with constraint)</stage>Madam, although the ties which existed
between us will be shortly severed, some interest may survive—on my part;

a society—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (interrupting)</stage>Which you have made your own. Can I take a
better model for my future conduct than a woman whom you so much admire?
Surely <hi>you</hi> cannot blame the lightness of a coquette, who is happy
only in the number of her admirers and her dupes. You follow in her
train—you swell her ranks—you applaud—approve—can you condemn

<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (stopping her)</stage>I understand your impatience, madam, but I

</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (restraining her natural impulse)</stage>Heaven help the   man!
there's nothing so tiresome and silly as a heart that really loves. I must
have wearied you to extinction. I gave my whole heart and soul to you. Ha,
ha, ha! It must have been ruefully fatiguing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p>And are you, then, so wholly changed?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (with coquetry)</stage>Well, perhaps, not quite.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

    <p>All the world is in the gallery. The new cotillon must be practised for the

    <stage>(aside)</stage> That was pretty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (low to Lady G.)</stage>Mabel I must speak to you—I entreat you, hear
me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (aside)</stage>Only too willingly, did I yet think myself secure.
    <stage>(aloud, paying no heed to Glenmorris)</stage> Sir Basil, I attend
you—Mr. Frankland, sorry to quit you; but dances and dresses are important
affairs of state for women. <hi>Au revoir</hi>.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p>I shall see you, then, again, madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

    <p><stage> (coquettishly)</stage>Who knows? Well, perhaps. Sir Basil, I am

</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p>That last look gave me hope. Hope! what do I mean by hope? Zounds! I no
longer know what I hope—  <pb n="29"/>what I desire—even what I feel. What madness
possesses a man to pursue these brilliant meteors of fashion, that flicker
thus, false lights, before our eyes—now luring one—now fascinating
another—and to disdain the true star of love—a pure confiding heart, that
shines steadily to one's own, and mirror's there its sole affection. Fools
are we all! Ah, were there still time to arrest Mabel—It is my duty!
    <stage>(going hastily, C. D.)</stage></p>
</sp><stage>Enter Lady Amaranthe, R.

    <p>I guessed you would await me here, you naughty, confident man!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (embarrassed)</stage>Certainly! My only thought was for you.
    <stage>(aside)</stage> What is Mabel doing now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>I pretended the necessity of a change in the trimming of my domino to leave
my guests—for I knew your impatience.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p>Certainly. <stage>(aside)</stage> She will be listening to the flatteries of
those cursed fools!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>I would have come sooner, but Lord Arthur Bramble persecuted me with fresh
protestations.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (with hope)</stage>Then he no longer courts that Mrs.  
Templemore.</p>

<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p>Ah!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>So are those traitors—men—ever affecting most tenderness when they most
design to break their chains. They are now practising the new dance
together.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (aside)</stage>She is dancing—dancing with him, while I— I—am
dancing, too, but on hot irons.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (aside)</stage>I could have torn the traitor's eyes out. But what
matter? My heart is not his—I feel it is wholly another's now. <stage>(aloud
    to Sir Aubrey, who is going up C. D.)</stage> Mr. Frankland, we have to
speak together seriously. I feel, in according this interview, which you
have so earnestly desired, a strange oppression—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (eagerly)</stage>A return of the vapours! Nothing like gaiety to
dissipate them. Suppose I lead you back to the company in the gallery.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>What! when the whole day you have sought  <pb n="30"/>to be alone with me in vain. Such
abnegation I did not expect. Come sit down, there—by my side.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (aside)</stage>I cannot stand this!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>

</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (holding the chair without sitting)</stage>I?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>  Yes—for before further explanations, you must dissipate the mystery that
surrounds you, for mystery there is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (not attending to her)</stage>Certainly! <stage>(goes up)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>So you avow it! Ah! you have been wrong to deceive me with insincerity. Come,

</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Glen.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (aside at C. D., looking out)</stage>Yes! there she is! What's that?
A note put into her hand! She approaches the window to read it! Oh,

    D.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>So, shame ties your tongue. Must I encourage you? Speak, then, and I, in
turn, will tell you of the plans that I have formed. <stage>(looking
    round)</stage> Gone? when I expected a fervid declaration—What does this
mean? I'm thunderstruck! <stage>Enter Sir Basil Bodkin, C. D.</stage> Sir
Basil! Well, in the general desertion, I am sure of the constancy of my lay
figure. <stage>(aloud to Bodkin, who is hunting about)</stage> What's the
matter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Bodkin.</speaker>
    <p>Ah, fair lady—I did not see you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Indeed!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Bodkin.</speaker>
    <p>I was seeking for a fan—Mrs. Templemore's fan.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Mabel again!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Bodkin.</speaker>
    <p>She is suffocating with heat, poor dear little woman. She has been dancing
with an incomparable grace. Ye gods, how she did dance! I don't see her fan.
    <stage>(going)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (L., with impatience)</stage>Sir Basil!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Bodkin.</speaker>
    <p> (R)I never saw any sylph so airy. She inspired me so, that I could have
tripped myself like another sylph.   Foregad! I could—It was all I could do
to keep myself from —<stage>(beginning to dance)</stage> I can't find her
fan. <stage>(going)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>Did I not bid you stay, Sir Basil? But this is unbearable! She has turned
every head then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Bodkin.</speaker>
    <p>Braybabble is dumb with admiration. Lord Faddle lisps more pathetically than
ever. Fripperycourt has laid his scented gloves at her feet; and Captain
Simper has positively found his tongue to express his devotion. It's a
general conflagration! Where the deuce is this fan?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (stamping with her foot)</stage>Stay, I tell you! And even you, it

    <p>At her feet!—he too!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Bodkin.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (aside)</stage>Eh, eh! a slip of the tongue—from a diplomatist
too—incredible! But it's the first time.</p>

    <p>You—you too! <stage>(aside)</stage> My very lay figure—my butt—my man of
straw seduced!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Bodkin.</speaker>
    <p>I don't know how it was. My habit of constant success—I could not help it.
But my heart is yours.</p>

<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (walking about in a fever of impatience—aside)</stage>So, it seems I
have taught a lesson for personal application—given arms to be directed

    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p><stage> (as before)</stage>But should Leonard also fall into her nets—I
cannot bear the thought. My project must be hastened at all ventures. I can
best escape from observation during the confusion of the masquerade. Mabel,
dressed in the domino similar to this, shall remain at the ball, and
unwittingly serve my plan. A secret marriage shall make me his for ever. By
degrees, the world may know the proud woman's weakness.</p>

    <p>  Let a hackney carriage await me at the corner of Lady Spangle's Street—I
would escape all observation—leave the world to learn my departure only by

Would I could crush my affection as I now crush these flowers. What's this,

rewarded by the repentance of the false one.” What does this mean? It is not
he then? But who—Ah, can it be possible? Can Mabel love me still?

me—hear the confession of a wretched criminal. <stage>(Lady Glenmorris

another, whose pure affection I disdained, has resumed her empire over my
heart—I love her alone—and if she restores me not her lost affection, I feel

    <p> (C.)Oh, recall not the words that you have uttered <stage>(Glenmorris kneels

unutterable. Aubrey! I have never ceased to love you—my coquetry was
affected—my coldness was the bitterest constraint. The only prize I sought
was your affection.</p>

    <p>Pardon me—had I revealed all at once, he had not been reclaimed. He had fled
me in confusion, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
    <p>And I was your victim. Know you into what a gulf of perdition you had nigh
plunged me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
    <speaker>Lady G.</speaker>
    <p>I know that I would make you happy by urging you to accept the hand of an
