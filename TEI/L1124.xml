     <stage type="setting">— The gardens of the Prince del Piombino's Villa — at the back a river,
      beyond which, picturesque country — on the L. side, the entrance to the villa — on the R. 3 E.
      side a small pavilion.</stage>
     <stage>Enter Quadro, Strutt, and Lisetta, from the villa, meeting male and female villagers,
      R.</stage>
     <sp who="#L1124_F10">
      <speaker>Liset.</speaker>
      <p> And you think yourself a vastly great man, Mr. Strutt, I suppose. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1124_M4">
      <speaker>Strut.</speaker>
      <p> Philosophers are not content with thinking, I know it. My master's a great man, and I'm
       like the moon to the sun, I shine with a reflected brightness. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1124_M5">
      <speaker>Quad.</speaker>
      <p> Great man, indeed! I should like to know what there is great about either of you. A couple
       of adventurers, whom my poor silly dupe of a master (Heaven help him!) has brought from that
       beggarly place, Germany; and I suppose you'll never leave him whilst he has got a ducat. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1124_M4">
      <speaker>Strut.</speaker>
      <p> Pooh! for his ducats! we want his ducats, indeed! when we could make gold out of any
       rubbish — your worthless head, for instance, Signor Quadro. My master is the most profound
       philosopher, and consequently the greatest man that ever lived; to tell you what he can do is
       impossible; but what he cannot do, it would be still more difficult to mention. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1124_M5">
      <speaker>Quad.</speaker>
      <p> Yes, his way of making gold, I fancy, is by conveying it out of other people's pockets. He
       may make gold, but he'd much rather have it made to his hand, I've a notion. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1124_M4">
      <speaker>Strut.</speaker>
      <p> Signor Quadro it is fortunate for you that my master does not hear you, and that
       (considering the choice bottles of Catanian wine that you have from time to time
       <pb n="5"/> been pleased to open for me) I'm too discreet to tell him; — for, oh! Signor
       Quadro, his power is terrible; — he could prevent you from ever passing a quiet night again!
      </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1124_M5">
      <speaker>Quad.</speaker>
      <p> When I've got three quarts of good Rhenish in my skin I'll give him leave, if he can. Your
       master is a water-drinker, sir, he keeps no butler; I never knew any good of a man that drank
       water and kept no butler. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1124_M4">
      <speaker>Strut.</speaker>
      <p> At all events, Master Quadro, that's an offence which you cannot lay to my charge; I have
       the most philosophical principles upon the subject; — I drink water, Signor Quadro, only when
       I can't get anything better. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1124_M5">
      <speaker>Quad.</speaker>
      <p> And that's generally the case, I fancy, when you can't find some good-natured simpleton,
       like the Prince del Piombino, to keep you and your master together. Instead of board-wages,
       he billets you upon the kitchen of anybody that's fool enough to take you into it. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1124_M4">
      <speaker>Strut.</speaker>
      <p> Be assured of this, Signor Quadro, I am not ungrateful; when any kind friend has the
       goodness to take me in, I do the best in my power to return the compliment. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1124_M5">
      <speaker>Quad.</speaker>
      <p> The devil doubt you. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1124_M4">
      <speaker>Strut.</speaker>
      <p> But for my master, Signor Quadro, don't think that all the wine in Sicily is any object to
       him; he could turn that river into wine if he thought proper, — I've seen him do it, sir, and
       convert a quart of simple water into a bottle of prime Burgundy. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1124_M5">
      <speaker>Quad.</speaker>
      <p> Can he? can he do that? Then he has an easy way of making me his sworn friend for life.
       Only let him turn — I won't be unreasonable; I won't say a word about the river — only let
       him turn the pump in our stableyard into a fountain of claret, and I'll never help myself to
       another bottle of my master's so long as I'm a butler. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1124_F10">
      <speaker>Liset.</speaker>
      <p> And pray, Mr. Strutt, has all this philosophy and learning quite driven the thoughts of
       love out of your head? I suppose you fancy yourself now quite above us poor weak women? </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1124_M4">
      <speaker>Strut.</speaker>
      <p> Not at all, my dear creature; for the man who has the impudence to fancy himself above the
       fairest half of human nature has sunk immeasurably below it. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L1124_M5">
      <speaker>Quad.</speaker>
      <p> Egad! philosophy has not made quite a fool of the fellow. But pray now, my good Mr.
       Strutt, amongst all this transmuting of metal, and converting of water, can you inform us
       what it is that this wonderful master of yours is doing in that pavilion, where he remains
       shut up, day and night, and into which no mortal but himself is ever permitted to penetrate?

      <p> Well, my master has done a nice job for himself, it should seem, with all his machinery
       and magic; the making of a man has unmade him for life, and I seem destined to share all his
       advantages. Because his hopeful bantling chose to amuse itself with strangling a child, much
       in the same way, I suppose, that our ordinary brats do kittens, out of pure kindness; they
       have seized hold of me and popped me into this underground apartment to keep me out of
       mischief; as if they thought I shared my master's propensities, and had a
       <foreign>penchant</foreign> for making of men and strangling of children. And so, after
       having taught me philosophy, my master has left me here to practise it. Now, if this were a
       wine cellar, there would be some kind of consolation; I might, by the magic of a butt of good
       liquor, convert this dungeon into a fairy palace, and when I could stand no longer, fancy
       these hard stones were like silken cushions. But everything now has the appearance of a
       cursed uncomfortable reality. Ha! I think I hear some one coming. I suppose it's old Quadro,
       who is about to set me at liberty, or at least to afford me the consolation of a flagon of
       his best. <stage>(the trap-door above opens, a ladder is put down, and Quadro descends,

     <head>Scene Four.</head>
     <stage type="setting">— A tremendous range of craggy precipices, near the summit of Mount Etna.
      On the R. a conspicuous pillar of rock stands on a lofty elevation — the only approach to the
      stage is from the depths below.</stage>
     <stage>The Monster, with gigantic strides, ascends from below with Emmeline and the Child — she
      is overcome with fatigue and terror and unable to speak — the Monster gains the elevation, and
      with a cord that is round his waist, binds Emmeline to the pillar of rock — he returns to the
      Child — Emmeline sinks on her knees in supplication — Frankenstein with great difficulty
      ascends from below — he perceives his Child in the Monster's power — he is about to rush on
      him; the Monster defies him, and Frankenstein, recollecting his former defeats, abandons his
      threatening gestures and assumes one of entreaty.</stage>
     <sp who="#L1124_M2">
      <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
      <p> Demon of cruelty, art thou still insatiate with the blood of innocence? how many victims
       does it require to content thy rage? I do implore thee; I, thy creator, who gave thee life,
       who endued thee with that matchless strength I cannot hope to master, I, on my knees, entreat
       thee but to spare that innocent. If fury and the thirst of blood be in thy hellish nature, on
       me, on me glut thy fell appetite, but oh, if in thy human frame there dwells one spark of
       human sympathy or feeling, spare, spare that unoffending child! </p>
     </sp>
     <stage>(The Monster points to his wound, expresses that he would willingly have served
      Frankenstein and befriended him, but that all his overtures were repelled with scorn and
      abhorrence — then, with malignant exultation seizes on the Child, and whirls it aloft, as if
      about to dash it down the rock — Emmeline screams, Frankenstein, with a cry of horror, covers
      his eyes — at this moment a thought occurs to Emmeline, she pulls from under her dress a small
      flageolet, and begins to play an air, its effect on the Monster is instantaneous — he is at
      once astonished and delighted, he places the Child on the ground, his feelings become more
      powerfully affected by the music, and his attention absorbed by it — the Child escapes to its
      father — Emmeline continues to play, Frankenstein intently to watch its effect on the Monster.
      <pb n="23"/> As the air proceeds his feelings become more powerfully excited, he is moved to
      tears; afterwards, on the music assuming a lively character, he is worked up to a paroxysm of
      delight, and on its again becoming mournful, is quite subdued, till he lays down exhausted at
      the foot of the rock to which Emmeline is attached. — Strutt now ascends with Ritzberg, and a
      number of Peasants variously armed, and furnished with strong cords.)</stage>
     <sp who="#L1124_M4">
      <speaker>Strut.</speaker>
      <p> There he is! that's him! that's my gentleman! and luckily for us, he seems in a bit a of
       snooze — now's our time or never. On him, my lads, and bind him fast, and then we shall be
       all right. </p>
     </sp>
     <stage>(with Ritzberg and others, he immediately falls on the Monster, and they bind him
      stoutly with cords — Frankenstein has meantime released Emmeline — the Monster makes
      prodigious exertions of strength to burst his bonds, but he is overpowered by the number of
      his adversaries.)</stage>
     <sp who="#L1124_M2">
      <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
      <p> Faithful creature! Eternal Providence, receive my thanks; and if it be thy pleasure to
       inflict on me an added punishment, oh! on this guilty head alone direct thy wrath; spare
       those who are most dear to me, those whose innocence may challenge thy compassion! </p>
     </sp>
     <stage>(with Emmeline and the Child he commences the descent, and disappears.)</stage>
     <sp who="#L1124_M4">
      <speaker>Strut.</speaker>
      <p> Now I think the best thing we can do is to fasten my gentleman to this pinnacle of rock;
       the cool air of this exalted region may give him an appetite; but he will stand very little
       chance of getting it gratified, unless the lava should flow from the volcano, and that may be
       a kind of cordial for him. <stage>(they are binding him to the rock, R., the Monster making a
       furious resistance, in the course of which he hurls one of the Peasants to the depths
       below)</stage> That's right, make a tight job of it, whilst you are about it; for if he once
       gets loose, he'll play the devil with you all; he'd crack you like so many walnuts. There, I
       think he'll do now; there's not much fear of his troubling us again for one while. If he gets
       away from here, and finds his way down to terra firma again, I'll give him leave to drink
       hob-and-nob with me, in the cup I have filled to celebrate his overthrow. </p>
     </sp>
     <stage>(they descend the precipice leaving the Monster attached to the pinnacle of rock — when
      they are gone, he redoubles his efforts to escape from his bonds, and at length succeeds — he
      surveys the chasm, and is afraid to venture down it — he firmly attaches to the pinnacle one
      end
      <pb n="24"/> of the cord by which he was bound — and by means of this lowers himself down the
      chasm.)</stage>

      <speaker>Strut.</speaker>
      <p> Faith, my lads, it's cold work this, climbing so near the summit of Ætna, in a chill
       evening breeze — yes, and fatiguing work, too — catching such game as we've been after is no
       boy's play. Lord, what a chap my master must be, to be sure; when he was making a man — he
       thought he might as well have a wopper at once, I suppose. Now I say, a little and good for
       my money. But, however, we have quieted my gentleman, and I think we have done a much better
       job than my master did in making him. And now I can tell you a secret. This passage leads to
       the hermitage of father Antonio; that you all know, so that's no secret; but what you perhaps
       do not know is, that old Quadro, the prince's butler, whenever he visits the holy father to
       confess, always brings a bottle or two of prime old wine, which is received by the hermit in
       lieu of penance; and so he makes his master pay for all his sins, and purchases absolution
       for one by committing another. Now my proposal is, that we adjourn to his cave and drink to
       the future prosperity of the heroes who subdued the Monster. </p>

      <p> Out with it, then, and in with it. If his reverence should miss it when he comes home, he

       my lads, charge your cups. <stage>(Peasants have meanwhile placed on the table several
       flagons of wine, horns, &amp;c.)</stage> Now for it, fill all, and mind it's a bumper.

     <stage>(They have their cups raised to their lips, when the Monster, still lowering himself by
      his rope, descends from an aperture in the roof of the cavern, and stands on the table in the
      midst of them — they all shrink back in terror with loud cries — and fly in extreme fear — the
      Monster in rage dashes about the seats — Strutt takes an opportunity to stab him in he back,

      &amp;c. as at the commencement of an eruption.</stage>
     <stage>(The Monster ascends from below, faint from loss of blood and overcome by fatigue — he
      is followed by Frankenstein, whom he immediately attacks and stabs with the dagger he had
      taken from his wound — as Frankenstein falls, Emmeline rushes in shrieking and catches his
      lifeless body — the Monster, attempting to escape, is met at every outlet by Soldiers and
      armed Peasantry — in despair he rushes up to the apex of the mountain — they rush in and fire
