    <head>Act I.</head>
    <stage type="setting">Scene—An apartment in the house of Madame de Fontanges. The room is
     spacious and handsomely furnished in the semi-classical style of the empire, with large folding
     doors communicating (in flat) with an adjoining room. A secret door in the wall (R.) concealed
     by a picture, and another side-door communicating with the staircase. Windows practicable. (L.)
     A writing table with writing materials. (L. C.) Caraffe of water and glasses. Fauteuils
     disposed about the stage. Fire-place between the windows, with bronze pendule and candelabra,
     and a glass over it.</stage>
    <stage>Cecile at the fire-place. Jabot arranging the inkstand and a breviary on the
     table.</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cecile.</speaker>
     <p>Seven o'clock, and Madame not returned! astonishing!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jabot.</speaker>
     <p>Cecile, how often must I repeat to you that servants in a good family ought never to be
      astonished? Madame is young, charming, a widow, and may choose her own hours.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cecile.</speaker>
     <p>For her visitors—yes; but you forget this is her night for receiving her Confessor; she
      never would dare to keep the Abbé Lenoir waiting.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jab.</speaker>
     <p>Pooh! she must leave a few of her sins to stand over till next week—there's a running
      account between them. When the Abbé arrives shew him in here, and take care he is not
      disturbed in his pious exercises.</p>
    </sp>
    <pb n="4"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cecile.</speaker>
     <p>Hark! there's a fiacre in the court <stage>(she looks out)</stage> The Abbé! <stage>(she
      arranges her cap and hair at the glass. A ring is heard)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jabot.</speaker>
     <p>What! even for an Abbé!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cecile.</speaker>
     <p>Why not? one must shew some respect for the church, Monsieur
      Jabot.<stage>                                        Exit Cecile, C.</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jabot.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, woman! woman! As if that walking monument of mortification had eyes for a waiting
      maid!<stage>Re-enter Cecile shewing in Fouché in the dress of an Abbé. He walks with an air of
      pious abstraction; his hands folded, and his eyes cast down.</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jab.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (R., wheeling an arm chair forward)</stage>Madame, unfortunately, has not yet
      returned—but she expected your Reverence's visit.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cecile.</speaker>
     <p> (L)And directed that we should show every attention to your Reverence's wishes.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fouché.</speaker>
     <p>  Thank you, my children—I wish to be alone— see that no one enters this room, except your
      mistress, or my other penitent, M. de Cevennes, should he arrive.<stage>Jabot bows, Cecile
      curtsies, and exeunt, L. Fouché, rising, takes a rapid survey of the room, then closes the
      window curtains, places the lights on the mantelpiece, and bolts the door by which they have
      gone, and also the folding-doors.</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Never trust an order while there's a bolt. Now for my ferret:—to all but me, M. le Bon, the
      respectable proprietor of the house next door—to me, Maximilian Desmarets, the most
      unmitigated rascal and most invaluable head of a secret department in Europe. It was a good
      idea of mine to establish him next door to Madame de Fontanges. We meet here unobserved.
      <stage>(He touches a spring in the frame of the picture, R. It moves, and discovers a secret
      door)</stage> Hist! Desmarets!<stage>Enter from the secret door Desmarets, with a despatch-box
      and papers. He takes a chair at the table, opens his box, unfolds his papers (R.), and sits
      looking at Fouche.</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>At least, I am sure to find YOU at your post! <stage>(Desmarets chuckles and rubs his
      hands)</stage> These women think only of pleasure.</p>
    </sp>
    <pb n="5"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Desmarets.</speaker>
     <p>So do I—my pleasure's here! <stage>(pointing to papers)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>I pay Madame de Fontanges enough to ensure diligence, too.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>Madame receives exactly double what I do. Suppose you reversed the proportions?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>You would serve me no better, and she would not serve me at all; besides, she has the
      enormous recommendation of an unblemished character!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>She!—so much for the world's judgment of a confirmed gambler!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>That is her only vice—a secret confined to us,   and her mask! It was a good thought to
      allow of masks at the public tables.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>Do they hide many blushes?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>They save many reputations. No, my excellent Desmarets, I have not spent twenty years in
      guaging the price of consciences without arriving at a tolerably fair estimate of the money
      value of my species, from Kings downwards.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>And you think my fidelity is worth just four thousand francs a month?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>With your character I think no one would pay half as much for your treachery.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>You think so?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>If anybody should make the offer let me know, and we can enter into a fresh arrangement!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>Ah! you know my heart is devoted to you!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>I know your <hi>head</hi> is, and, as times go, that is perhaps a better security. But to
      work:—first, your despatches from England!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>Two.—<stage>(takes papers)</stage> One from Mons. Ouvrard, announcing that he has opened a
      negotiation for peace in <hi>your</hi> name, with the Foreign Secretary, but that he fears
      your other agent, Mons. Fagan, is not to be trusted.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Ordered—that M. Ouvrard keep a strict watch over M. Fagan. <stage>(Desmarets makes a note on
      the despatch)</stage> And the other?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>  From M. Fagan, stating that your overtures for peace have been most favourably received by
      the English Prime Minister, but that he has reason to believe M. Ouvrard is in the pay of the
      Emperor.</p>
    </sp>
    <pb n="6"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Ordered—that M. Fagan establish a close espionage on M. Ouvrard. <stage>(Desmaret's makes a
      note on despatch as before)</stage> I have long found the advantage of running my agents in
      couples. Two rogues so employed are as good as one honest man!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>And so much easier found.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>The envoy of the Emperor has not yet arrived in London?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (referring to another paper)</stage>No; he reached Amsterdam on the 3rd, but he will
      not sail for three weeks. I have made the necessary arrangements.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Good; by that time I shall have concluded my negociations, and the Emperor will have found
      himself once more anticipated by his Minister of Police. We must teach these people that they
      cannot do without us.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>It is a dangerous lesson sometimes with such pupils as the Emperor.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Hem! he has trusted me too far, Desmarets. Those letters, from his own hand, extending over
      the last ten years, are my security. While I have those, I stake his credit against my
      portfolio.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>  And those letters, thanks to my skill in iron work, are safe in their secret deposit
      yonder <stage>(pointing off to secret door)</stage> How lucky the Revolution made a locksmith
      of me when it made a Member of the National Convention of you!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, we have both been able to serve the state and ourselves—go on.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (takes a pamphlet up)</stage>From our London correspondent for printed
      papers—another of those pamphlets signed “Timon,” which have been already found so
      disagreeable in high quarters.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Another? Is the Emperor never to be released from these attacks? Has this one reached
      France?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>Thirty thousand copies have been distributed, but I am sorry to say I have not yet
      discovered by what channel, which is the more annoying as this one is not directed against the
      Emperor.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Indeed! against whom, then?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>Against yourself!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Ah! <stage>(starts up)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>It gives a very minute and apparently accurate account of your career.</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>No matter. <stage>(uneasily)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>From the date of your Professorship at Nantes all is recorded—your strong measures in the
      Convention—your speeches in the Jacobin Club—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>  Enough, enough!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>What he calls your peculations in the Nièvre—your vote for the death of the King—your
      establishment of the Goddess of Reason in the Nivernais—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Pshaw! A truce to those youthful indiscretions.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>Your massacre at Lyons—your—</p>

     <p><stage> (striking sharply on the table)</stage>Desmarets, the mind of France must not be
      poisoned in this way!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>Unfortunately the facts are supported by regular official documents.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>They are forgeries—I destroyed all those papers when I became Minister.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>They may have been preserved, or copied.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Impossible! you alone had access to them besides myself!—Desmarets, how comes it this man is
      not discovered before this?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>Ha! ha! ha! What do you say to this. <stage>(Rises, and shows a written paper much frayed
      and dirtied)</stage> If we have not the man we have his handwriting.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Give it me. How did you get this?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>Through one of <hi>my</hi> agents—a compositor of the London printer, who puts into type
      these detestable calumnies.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Your register of handwritings—quick! <stage>(Desmarets gives a small book which he takes
      from the box)</stage> Peltier, Fontaine, De Coigny, Talon. None of the known hands—Yet it is
      clearly not a feigned character. It is flowing,   bold, natural!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>Like that of a man who believes what he writes, and glories in writing it—The wretch!

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>I must have this scribbler, Desmarets, <stage>(stopping)</stage> do you hear? I must have
      him; the author of these miserable calumnies must be found—must disappear—a cell in Vincennes
      first, and then a file of Grenadiers. Find him for me, and I will not say what I will do for
      you, Desmarets. <stage>(He walks up and down, rapidly turning over the pamphlet)</stage></p>

     <p>Yes—at half-past seven. 'Tis close on the time.</p>

     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>Sir, pardon me and I will confess all!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Let me see first what there is to confess. <stage>(he reads from a paper very
      rapidly)</stage> On the 6th you obtained a   passport for Ostend on pretence of sea
      bathing—you travelled by post in a green caléche without arms—dined at Amiens, and complained
      of the amount of your bill—you then purchased a woodcock pie—for refreshment in the carriage I
      presume—slept at Montreuil, and swore at the damp sheets—arrived at Ostend on the 9th—had an
      interview with Mons. Delbecq, agent for facilitating the passage of the Bourbonists to
      England—were landed by him on the beach near Dover at 8 p.m., after suffering much from sea
      sickness—proceeded next morning to Hartwell—had an interview with the exiled Louis XVIII., at
      which you presented a statement of services, professed devotion, and asked for a Dukedom.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>Good gracious! All known! But I was alone with the King.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Mons. de Blacas was in the room. When two persons are together I generally know what passes,
      when three invariably.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>Is it possible?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>You subsequently assured Mons. de Blacas that Napoleon Buonaparte was the man most detested
      by all classes in France—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, no! your grace—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Except the wretch Fouché! Thank you, Mons. De Cevennes.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>  But I assure you—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>One moment—where was I? “Except the wretch Fouché!” Shall I go on, or can your confession
      add anything to this tolerably complete detail?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, Sir! as you are omniscient, be merciful. If the devotion of a life—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>That is a kind of devotion I have not, hitherto, found very available.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>If my gratitude—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>In my experience, fear is a more efficacious stimulus. Listen; I have need at the Austrian
      Court of a
      <pb n="10"/> trusty envoy—<stage>(De Cevennes bows)</stage> a man of high rank— <stage>(De
      Cevennes bows again)</stage> and of polished manners. <stage>(De Cevennes bows still
      lower)</stage> I offer you the mission.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>I fly—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>You had better receive your instructions first. You are among Madame de Fontanges' guests
      to-night. <stage>(De Cevennes bows)</stage> In an hour a carriage will be waiting in that
      courtyard, furnished with money, passports, and all that is necessary for a rapid and
      uninterrupted journey to Prague. You will stop at the Kaiser Karl Hotel, and ask for Madame
      Schoenbrunn. You will be shewn to a lady masked. You will deliver to her these despatches,
      <stage>(giving them)</stage> and return at once, without pushing curiosity or gallantry
      further.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>  I will be as mute as a fish and as cold blooded.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>And—yes, I think I may trust you so far—you will also present to that lady a
      <hi>bonbonnière</hi> from Mons. Lenoir. Remember the name.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>Mons. Lenoir. It is engraved, Monsieur, here, <stage>(touching his forehead)</stage> as your
      clemency and confidence are here <stage>(touching his heart)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>And this is the suspicious and double-dealing Fouché! Confess, your friends of the Faubourg
      St. Germain do us injustice, marquis.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>I will undeceive them. Oh! your grace, I have been so ill requited for my services to the
      Royal Family. Here is my statement of them, I presented it six times without any effect to the
      King, I mean the exile. If you think it would serve me with the Emperor—<stage>(shews a paper,

     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, I wish to make a note of it, for employment in my bureau. Such a writer ought to be at
      once laid hold of.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (aside)</stage>What a chance for him! <stage>(aloud)</stage> His name is Henry de

    </sp>
    <sp>

      his ways.</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>As your's have been. I should like to see him. Bring him with you to-night; but remember
      that, in this house, I am not Fouché, the Duke of Otranto, but the Abbé Lenoir.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>I pledge you the honour of a De Cevennes; and when did a De Cevennes succumb to either fear

     <p>You are right. A Minister of Police, under the Emperor, cannot afford the luxury. Look here,

     <p>You do not seem to relish this discovery. <stage>(suspiciously)</stage> Ah! I see—you can't
      bear that I should have made it, instead of yourself; but enough, I feel I hold him fast.
      Order a coach here at nine—a gendarme in disguise on the box. Plant a double file of mounted
      gendarmes in the stable, who will take their posts on either side when the prisoner is in the
      carriage; and resist to the death any attempt at escape between this and Vincennes. Let that
      coach take its place to the right of the court-yard; the carriage to convey   De Cevennes to
      Prague, to the left. I will write a letter to the governor of the fortress, from your cabinet.
      You will wait here to receive Madame de Fontanges—why, Desmarets, you look confounded!</p>

     <p>De Neuville discovered—arrested! will he have mettle to resist and keep the secret? Should
      he turn coward and purchase pardon by discovering that it is from one of Fouché's confidential
      agents he received the information contained in the pamphlet—should he have preserved the
      letter which sent it—should Fouché discover that letter came from me! He must not be arrested,
      or my life is not worth an old pen stump. But how to baffle Fouché? Let me see—let me see—I am
      as much excited as he was—I can't think coolly! <stage>(sits down and pours out glass after

     <p>The haunt of intrigue, servility, and treachery; a great prison, where every one is the

      champagne. I sigh for my native Guadaloupe! Oh, Abbé! if you but knew our island—its blue,

     <p>  I thought he was invulnerable to shame, as he is inaccessible to pity. Depend upon it

    <stage type="setting">Scene.—A prettily furnished room in a cottage, overlooking the Elbe and
     the city of Prague; large French windows, practicable, open on a spacious terrace, with a
     balustrade and vases of flowers; a light verandah, covered with creepers, shades it from the
     sun. R., a door leading to Madame de Fontanges' dressing room; door L., leading to the entrance
     to the cottage from without. Rustic, but elegant furniture, books, flowers. &amp;c., on
     embroidery frame. Cecile in a great chair, with work in her hand, stretching and yawning.

     <p>Oh, dear! oh, dear! what a length these German days are, to be sure! I suppose it's because
      one measures time by laughs in Paris, and by yawns in Prague. Two months have we been here—two
      months with nothing to look at but those stupid trees, and flowers, and clouds, and that
      great, long, lazy river, run—running, shine—shine— <stage>(yawning)</stage> shining in the sun
      all the day long! Whatever could bring Madame to a place like this? Prague! as if anybody in
      their senses ever went to Prague <stage>(takes a long stretch)</stage> and she pretends to
      enjoy it, too! To be sure, she has M. de Neuville to make love to her, and very nicely he
      makes it. And I've nobody but that stupid Karl, who
      <pb n="24"/> makes nothing but hay. Madame could not bring a valet from Paris, so we took Karl
      with the cottage. <stage>Enter Grisboulle, D. L.</stage> He's dreadful—doesn't even talk, only

      He hasn't spent much time in his own little cottage since he made Madame's acquaintance! I
      never saw a poor young   man more in love, but Madame doesn't treat him as I should treat such
      a lover. <stage>(Grisboulle retires and busies himself with the flower vases on the

     <p>Dear, dear! one might as well try to amuse one's self with a German Primer. “Ach,” “Och,”
      “Ich!” all in grunts of one syllable. But here comes Madame. <stage>Enter Madame de Fontanges
      from the terrace</stage> A note, Madame, from M. de Neuville.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>So: you may go, Cecile. <stage>(Gives hat to Cecile: who puts it on couch, and exit,
      L.)</stage> He has been playing truant for the last twenty-four hours, and this explains his
      absence, I suppose. Poor fellow! I fear my dart has pierced rather deeper into that bare bosom
      <pb n="25"/> than into the well-padded chests of my Parisian adorers.   The vehemence of his
      passion startles me sometimes. It is his tropical temperament, I suppose. The sun, which has
      bronzed his cheek, may have enriched his blood and quickened his susceptibilities, but can it
      make nature truer, or affection more constant? No! he may be as changing
      <!-- rest of page missing from UM copy --> and hollow as the rest. If you could but believe in
      man, what a glorious thing love would be! The few tranquil weeks I have spent here, since by a
      simple artifice I made his acquaintance, I really think have been the four happiest of my
      life. I have not once missed the excitement of the cards! Strange! in playing with his heart,
      there have been moments when his earnestness has shot a sudden thrill through me which I never
      felt before. If it were the first stir of love! Pshaw! let me remember what I am, and what I
      have to do! I wish Fouché had found another instrument. But his note. <stage>(she opens it and
      reads)</stage> “Madame—” Madame! we are distant this morning, Monsieur—“If I listened to the
      promptings of my heart I would not begin thus coldly—” listen to them, Monsieur! happy you if
      you hear anything— “but I dare not, and yet I cannot stifle them. I love you madly—” poor
      fellow! “with a passion violent like my nature, but reverential as my worship of that saint
      whose sweet name you bear—” pretty! “my love is so real, so ungovernable—you must have seen
      it—” What were eyes given us for? “and yet you will not deal with me as a true-hearted   woman
      should.” Alas! if truth and heart both be wanting! “I would live for you—die for you—and you
      but trifle with me. Either tell me I am indifferent to you, and then I will go and wrestle
      with my grief alone, or show, by a tenderness like my own, that you are worthy of as true a
      devotion as ever man felt for woman.” <stage>(she pauses)</stage> “I have struggled with
      myself the whole night through before writing this—I am almost mad. If I am too bold, forgive
      me—for I cannot live out of your sight: may I come for your answer.—Henri de Neuville.”
      <stage>(she sits and lets the letter fall on her lap)</stage> If it should be true that his
      heart is of a different mould from those that till now have found their best use as my
      playthings, what a terrible task is this I am about? I will go no further with it! But
      Fouché's orders are irrevocable; and, alone as I am here, so far away from Paris, I feel as if
      his cold relentless eye was on me at every turn.
      <pb n="26"/> Who knows? this man may after all be only a more consummate actor than the rest!
      This show of rough sincerity may be art. No, no! I feel in my inmost self that he is true and
      noble! To win such a heart might make any woman proud; but to win it on a cold, passionless
      calculation—to win it that I may place it under the point of Fouché's stiletto! Oh! foul,
      foul! The more noble it is, the more hideous is my treachery! What is to be done?<stage>Enter

     <p>Your pardon, Madame, if I have come without a   summons—You have read my letter?</p>

     <p>The tone of it is new to me.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Neuv.</speaker>
     <p>It may be, for it is the voice of a real, a devoted love—the love of a man who has never
      felt before what it was to hang with all his being upon the breath of another. Till now I have
      shared the hopes, and fears, and projects of my party, of those who looked to the restoration
      of our rightful King. But now ambition, projects, plots, hopes, fears, all are dead within
      me—my life, my soul are yours!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (restraining herself)</stage>I believe you feel all this now, but who can answer for
      himself a week hence? Love! Who that knows the changefulness of the weather and the fashions

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>At least do not conclude too soon. I shall soon return to Paris, and absence will test your
      devotion.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Neuv.</speaker>
     <p>Absence! You do not think I can leave you?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>  Nay, it is impossible you can return to Paris, where Fouché threatens your liberty—indeed
      your life!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Neuv.</speaker>
     <p>Ha! so danger is to deter me! Go, go! that you may see if I will follow—aye, though Fouché's
      spies
      <pb n="27"/>were ranged at every barrier, and I must run the gauntlet of them all! But why
      return to Paris? You are free. Our positions are equal. I offer you my hand for the hundredth
      time! Oh, make me happy with yours, and we will live here in an exile that we shall bless,
      because in it we shall be all in all to each other!</p>

     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (aside)</stage>This is real! And shall I be his destroyer? Forgive, me M. de

     <p>I would not believe you. Give me a better reason.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>You have grave duties to your party— duties which love distracts you from. Till your King is
      restored to France you have no right to chain your destinies to a woman.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Neuv.</speaker>
     <p>The King was first in my heart till I knew you—   now he is second. A better reason still.

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>He! Oh, no; my heart is free! But why force me to say there are motives—I regard you too

    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>How do you know that I have one?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Neuv.</speaker>
     <p>By the colour that mounts to your cheek when I speak to you of love; by the languor that
      veils your eyes when we sit together and watch the sunset in a silence too passionate for
      speech; by the trembling of your voice when we bid each other farewell; by the thrill that
      shoots from my being to yours, from yours to mine, when our hands meet, or a tress of your
      hair brushes my cheek. By these signs, and the thousand subtler that a lover's eye can see but
      no tongue can describe, so delicate are they—you have a heart, Marie de Fontanges, and that
      heart is mine! <stage>(he seizes her hand)</stage></p>

     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>No, no; but seriously, <stage>(sits)</stage> are you wise in yielding to this passion for

      perhaps?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Neuv.</speaker>
     <p>No; the instincts of such a love as mine are infallible;—it would shrink up at the contact

     <p>Oh! I could tell you stories of him that would horrify you! Conceive his employing a troop
      of wretched, degraded women, whom he calls his “Cohorte Cythérienne,” to attract his victims

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>Death!—Yes! But he can disgrace these women; reveal their shame to the world—nay, worse—to
      those they love, and who love them! What death is so sharp as that?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>Poor creatures—poor creatures! They are much to be pitied. I pity them, especially when I

     <p>Yes, the mask is off at last! I see my hideous self! And he thinks me pure! The sincerity of
      his own nature reflects itself on mine! What an awakening, should he learn the truth! And
      Desmarets, malignant as he is, will soon find out I love him. What is to be done? Fouché alone
      can relieve me from this task, which, base always, is now a sacrilege; for I love him—love him
      as he is worthy to be loved—love him with my whole soul! Yes! I will write to Fouché.
      <stage>Enter Desmarets by Terrace.</stage> I feel a power within me that will work even upon
      <hi>him</hi>. I will write at once! <stage>(as she turns for writing materials her eye falls

    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>I have despatched M. de Neuville into Prague for   my calêche. Let me congratulate you,
      Madame, on the restorative effects of the Austrian air. You look so much better,—that is—you
      did until you saw <hi>me</hi>. You were going to write to Fouché—pray write—unless you think I
      can save you the trouble.</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>He has sent you down here?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>Yes; he was naturally anxious about your health, and he sent me to enquire—merely to
      enquire. He was also anxious to know how our little ruse was succeeding— when we might expect
      to see the Siren wing her flight back to Paris, with her captive in her clutch.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>M. Desmarets, I have lived a new life since that promise was made. I cannot keep it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>Ah—M. Fouché will be sorry to hear it. He is so particular about promises, so very
      particular—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>Sir, you have pofessed an interest in me; if you retain a spark of that interest still,
      release me from the degrading task to which M. Fouché has condemned me.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>Listen to me, Marie de Fontanges. I am not young, not pleasant to look at; I have no graces
      of speech; I am what the world calls a spy, an informer—what you will that is more ignoble and
      treacherous; but I have a will like iron, and a head which, under any other chances, might
      have made a different man of me. Till I knew you, all my species were alike to me—counters to
      be pushed about   as suited my game; but at sight of you I felt that you were my fate—my good
      angel, if you chose to be so!</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>Let me finish. You spurned me once in a fashion that few men of a less determined spirit
      would provoke or endure twice. Yet I provoke it again, for proud as you are I love you
      still!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>Oh! no, no!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>I love you still! There is but one way to save you from Fouché—it is by sacrificing him!
      Give me but hopes that time will change your scorn of me to endurance—leave me to change
      endurance into pity, and pity into love. From the day which gives me that hope, Joseph
      Fouché's fall and your rescue are both begun!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>This from you! I thought you were devoted to him?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, so I am—so I am!—ha, ha, ha! but my devotion never stands in the way of my
      will—never!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>

     <p>Ah, Monsieur, you are very polite! Yes, it was a delightful soirée—that is, all but the
      little mistake which
      <pb n="33"/> concluded it. Would you believe it, Sir, I've been three times to Prague and back
      since that eventful evening! But it's very odd—many as are the despatches I carry, I never
      bring back any answer—“<foreign>vestigia nulla retrorsum</foreign>!” Not that I return empty
      handed, either—the ladies of the court employ me about their little commissions—give me things
      to carry—the oddest things, sometimes. Now, on this occasion, what do you think the Duchess
      von Kaiserleben gave me to take to the Duke of Otranto? Only guess?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Oh! fool that I was to leave my calêche at Prague! She carries my secret with her! My
      fortune—my life may depend on my outstripping them to Paris. But this note to De Neuville!—“I
      love you passionately!” Can she really love him? Then her listening to me was a trick to worm
      my secret out of me, and then use it for herself. I see it all, all now! Oh! gull, idiot that
      I am! She loves him, and so flies to escape the revelation of her infamy face to face. What
      hinders me from revealing it to him still? Or shall I keep the secret and let him follow her
      to Paris? Were he brought there, Fouché's end would be gained. He has burnt my letters. I have
      nothing to fear from his arrest now. Yes, it shall be done—he shall follow her to Paris. She
      has gone with De Cevennes—ah! jealousy—jealousy!—
      <pb n="38"/>I will destroy him, reveal her shame, and break two hearts —all at one blow. Ho!

      It is another arm against Fouché. Now to secure the papers Desmarets described— with them I

     <p><stage> (aside)</stage>So, it was he! <stage>(aloud)</stage> My dear Madame, if I gave up my
      sources of information I should not long hold my portfolio of the Police. Enough, that I know
      of your leaving Prague in company with the Marquis.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>You had your spies even there! Perhaps you know my reasons for leaving?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>The reason you gave the Marquis, of course. But a lady's real reasons are beyond even my
      penetration. Perhaps you will favour me with them—I am all attention.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>You know how I struggled against the duty you imposed upon me. <stage>(he bows)</stage> But
      your hold over me was too strong—<stage>(he bows again)</stage> I yielded, and set about   my
      work—reluctantly, at first, but by degrees the devil of womanly vanity got the upper hand, and
      I laid siege to De Neuville's heart with all the arts that my experience of Parisian society
      had taught me. Impassioned and inexperienced in woman's wiles he was an easy conquest.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>You see I chose my emissary well.</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>You did not!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Ah?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>You thought the hot wind of play had dried up in me all that was good or akin to good.—I
      thought so too.—Neither of us knew how vital the roots of love are in
      <pb n="42"/> a woman's nature. At contact with the fresh and springing life of his passion my
      dead affection wakened, till what we both thought a stone became a living, leaping, loving,
      woman's heart. I found him ready to follow me to the jaws of death—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>And you did not lead him to Paris? It was a blunder!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>I resolved to risk my life to save his. I knew all I exposed myself to in disobeying your
      orders. I knew that shame, imprisonment, perhaps death, lay in the path of duty. There they
      sit in you—and here <stage>(rising)</stage> stands love in me to meet and grapple with
      them!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (rises)</stage>You would have made a capital actress! But no heroics, pray—leave
      them to the theatre and Mademoiselle   Georges. You have told me what brought you back; and
      now oblige me by explaining how you mean to conduct this struggle between shame, &amp;c., or
      Joseph Fouché, and love, &amp;c., or Marie de Fontanges?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>I should not have said “struggle.” How can an unfriended woman struggle with the potent
      Minister of Police?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Exactly the question I wished to ask, better expressed.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>I meant, after telling you the truth, to have appealed to the good I cannot believe utterly
      dead in you, now that it has revived in me. Ah, Fouché! think of all that virtuous love means
      in a woman like me—self-scorning, self-loathing, living only to be the prey of frantic
      excitement, or the tool of dark intrigues.—It is the branch that sweetens the bitter waters of
      my life—the ray that breaks upon the labours of the prisoner to tell him he has pierced the
      outer wall of his dungeon. Till I knew it, I had nothing to believe in—nothing to
      venerate—nothing to live for. Having it, a future of peace and purity opens before me. Do not
      darken this future! Spare him, that I may love him—far from Paris, far from plots, and
      intrigues, and passions. Spare him, Fouché! spare him! —and spare me! <stage>(she has risen
      while speaking, and now falls on her knees grasping Fouché's hand)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (who has betrayed once or twice slight signs of emotion)</stage>What eloquence
      earnestness gives! I never could

      this again when you are less excited.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>No—now—here. I will not leave this spot till you have answered me.</p>

      I must. What would the world, say of Fouché if they heard, that having the serpent under his

     <p>My movements, like my intelligence, are rather mysterious, Marquis! But here I am.—I
      congratulate you on your quick return, and on your fair <hi>compagnon de voyage!</hi></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>Oh! your Grace has heard! It's incredible!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p> (R.)You delivered your despatches?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>Yes!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>They required no answer. I think I may dismiss you at once to Madame.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>Ah! I had almost forgotten! The Duchess Von Kaiserleben—really, 'tis too odd, too
      ridiculous—particularly requested me—you'll excuse the absurdity—to present the Abbé
      Lenoir—now don't be angry!—with this walking cane!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Give it me! <stage>(coolly taking the cane from the Marquis)</stage></p>

     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>You are not surprised?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Never! so—a pretty cane! The handle is a souvenir. <stage>(looking at the head)</stage> See!
      <stage>(shows it him)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>Why, I never observed before; 'tis a death's head and cross bones!</p>
    </sp>
    <pb n="45"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>  Yes; an appropriate present to me, in my spiritual capacity; very pretty and cheerful!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>Remarkably! <stage>(aside)</stage> How very lugubrious!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>You are impatient to see your travelling companion? You will find her in that room;
      <stage>(pointing to folding doors, L.)</stage> return here before you leave the house. I may
      have a fresh commission for you—a new mark of the imperial favor.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>Ah, your Grace! <stage>(aside)</stage> I wish, though, he'd give me a leetle time for repose
      between my journies; I am worn to a
      skeleton!<stage>                                        Exit De Cevennes, L.</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>So—and now for Czernitcheff's despatch; it should announce the final stipulations for the
      Russian alliance. <stage>(begins to unscrew the head of the cane)</stage> The Emperor's heart
      is set on the Austrian Archduchess; but my head on the Russian. Head against heart is
      desperate odds always! <stage>(he has unscrewed the head and has found the hollow
      empty)</stage> How's this? Empty? Can Czernitcheff be retreating, or has this fool discovered
      and abstracted the paper? No, no; it is incredible! Or can some sharper sight have penetrated
      the secret? I must find out, for this is a matter of life and death to me! I have gone between
      the lion and his prey, and have no inclination to try the weight of his imperial paw.

     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (angrily)</stage>So! Sir—this is the way you discharge your commissions! The

     <p>Mutilated! The stick is as when I received it—upon the honor of a De Cevennes.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>The Duchess's letter, describing it, speaks of diamonds in the eyes of the skull. They have
      been abstracted.</p>

     <p>No—upon my honor!</p>

     <p>The stick must have quitted your hands!</p>

     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>Never! I kept tight hold of it all the way from Prague to Paris.</p>

     <p>Oh! M. le Duc—what a slur on the honor of a De Cevennes!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>That for the honor of the De Cevennes. <stage>(crosses L. snapping his fingers)</stage> I am
      dissatisfied with you, Sir! I know your intrigues with the exiled family—you may need to take
      better care of your own head, than you have of this cane's. Look to it, Sir! And now, sit at
      that table and write, briefly, the stages of your journey, your places of stoppage, the
      persons you met. <stage>(aside)</stage> I must at once despatch another messenger to enquire
      into this; in the mean time, lest there   should be anything in Madame's threat, there can be
      no harm in setting a watch to see that she does not leave the house

    <pb n="47"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>There's a hitch somewhere. In fact, I'm a disgraced—a ruined man, and it will be entirely
      owing to the Duke's good nature if I'm not denounced to-morrow, for my treasonable
      correspondence with the King. He says there are diamonds missing from the head of that
      cane.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>Hush! there is missing from that cane what is more precious to Fouché than all the diamonds
      of Golconda. There needs but one quarter of an hour's resolution to enable you to save
      yourself and to ruin him.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>Only a quarter of an hour's resolution? Madame, I am prepared for any danger—speak!</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>The cane concealed a secret dispatch.</p>

     <p>A secret despatch!</p>

     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, Madame! How could you?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>Many lives depended on it. That paper involves Fouché in the guilt of high
      treason—<stage>(she produces despatch letter.)</stage> It is here. Take it instantly to the
      Grand Chamberlain—yes, there is a ball at the Tuïlleries to-night—he will no doubt conduct you
      to the Emperor. State you came from me—</p>

     <speaker>Cev.</speaker>
     <p>But this letter?</p>

     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>That I love him! Ah, he is so inexperienced—and these Creoles are so passionate! And then I

     <p>I am sorry for it. I tell you—</p>

     <p>Oh, mercy! mercy! Do not!</p>

     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>  There stands the woman who, when you escaped hence, followed you to Prague to win your
      affections and lure you back to death at Paris—your affections are hers— you are in Paris—she
      has obeyed her orders—<stage>(she sinks on her knees, L. C., hiding her face)</stage> as
      becomes the spy, the decoy of Fouché.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Neuv.</speaker>

     <p>Marie, you hear him? Tell him as I have told him—he lies! likes like a coward! How's this?
      No word? You hide your eyes when they should strike him dumb! Marie, speak to me, if not to
      him; say he lies! Oh! God! he lies! Marie, does he not lie?</p>

    <stage>Enter Fouché, C., in Court dress.</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p> (C.)Let me answer that!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Neuv.</speaker>
     <p>The Abbe Lenoir—in this dress!—but you know her, Abbé!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>First let me set you right about myself! I am Fouché, though, thanks to Madame's
      complaisance, I have been occasionally allowed to usurp the character of her confessor.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>She needs one no longer now; I have confessed for her!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Let her agony save her the pain of an avowal. Accept my assurance that what this gentleman
      has said is, oddly enough, the truth! <stage>(De Neuville sinks into a chair, R. C., and hides
      his head on his folded arms, which rest on the table)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (to Madame de Fontanges, who has dragged herself up to a chair and sits on it,
      ghastly pale)</stage>I told you the serpent   could sting! <stage>(crosses to L.
      C.)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>This shock is naturally overpowering at first, but you will get over it,—particularly with
      the advantages for cool reflection which you will have in Vincennes, to which safe and retired
      residence I have particular pleasure in consigning the brilliant and sarcastic Timon!
      <stage>(goes up stage)</stage> Lest you should make any attempt at escape, I may inform you
      that the house is guarded at every exit. And now, Desmarets, perhaps we had better leave them
      together a little—they may need some mutual explanation. <stage>(looking at Madame de
      Fontanges)</stage> Poor creature! she threatened me, Desmarets! <stage>(going off C. and
      L.)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>Ah,—And she spurned <hi>me</hi>—but I bear no
      malice!<stage>                                        following Fouché by C.</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (struggles up and walks falteringly to where De Neuville sits. She stands before him
      with her head bent down.)</stage>Henri! M. de Neuville!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Neuv.</speaker>
     <p>Still here!—I hoped I was alone! <stage>(he turns from her, throws his head down on the
      table, and sobs bitterly. She approaches him and tries to take his hand—he looks up
      fiercely)</stage> Do not touch me! I wish I could have spared you the sight of this
      humiliation. It is not for myself I am so shaken, but that you—you whom I had set so high in
      my heart should be so fallen! A spy! worse— a decoy!</p>
    </sp>
    <pb n="53"/>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>It is true; but let me not hear it from your lips. Spare me! spare me! I cannot bear it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Neuv.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (passionately)</stage>Why cross my path? What wrong have I done to you that you
      should wreck my happiness thus? Why do you stay?—Is it to look on the ruin you   have made?
      Why are you not with them for the wages of your work?—You have earned them well—too well!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>No, no, no!—do not look at me so— speak so! I was not vile enough to finish what I had the
      vileness to begin. I loved you, Henri, at last—truly, fondly loved you—with the love before
      which life and death are indifferent. Only one thing I could not bear—your scorn! It was dread
      of this that kept me from avowing the shameful truth that sometimes made your softest words
      daggers. If you knew the weight of self-scorn I bore under my happiness in your love—my nights
      of bitter tears—my days of hidden shame—fallen as I am, you would pity me, Henri— indeed you
      would! <stage>(still kneeling.)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Neuv.</speaker>
     <p>How am I to know this tone does not mask some new treachery?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>No! my shame is revealed now—and that—that was all I ever concealed from you!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Neuv.</speaker>
     <p>And your flight was not to draw me to my destruction?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>No!—as I live, no! It was to try one last appeal to Fouché for release from my infamy.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Neuv.</speaker>
     <p>But what could she have been who could first lend herself to such ignominy?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>A gambler, Henri!—enticed to the table by Fouché's arts—beggared there by his agents—and
      then, when ruin and dishonour beset me, the tempter was ever at   my elbow with gold. I
      listened—I fell—I became his spy; once fallen to that, the man who tempted me ordered me to
      tempt you—and I did tempt you—wretched woman as I am —you, for whom if I had a thousand lives
      I would give them all!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Neuv.</speaker>
     <p>Poor, poor Marie! My suffering dates but a few hours back, and yours has been the misery of
      years!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (rises and advances, C.)</stage>But is the agony I feel now no atonement for my
      past, Henri? I feel as if it might be—my suffering has been so bitter—so bitter!
      <pb n="54"/> You will let me take your hand, Henri? <stage>(she takes it, he does not
      resist)</stage> There are tears in your eyes—you look upon me as you did in those happy days
      when you thought me worthy of your love! I feel that I have destroyed you. Henri—forgive me, I
      did not mean to use that word!—May I still call you so?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Neuv.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (in a broken voice)</stage>Yes, yes!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>Ah! I am forgiven! Speak!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Neuv.</speaker>
     <p>Yes! yes, my poor Marie! I forgive the past— such suffering and such repentance redeem all!
      <stage>(she falls into his arms; he presses her to his heart)</stage> And so we will meet fate
      together! They did not look to find us thus—thy wet cheek on my loving heart! I can face
      imprisonment, death, now, if it must be, without a quiver! <stage>(they embrace and remain in
      each other's arms)</stage><stage>Enter Fouché and Desmarets with Soldiers, C.</stage></p>

     <p>Kill me! kill me! How can I live with his blood upon my head? Henri! Henri! <stage>(the

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Neuv.</speaker>
     <p> (L. C.)One moment, gentlemen. Joseph Fouché, so sure as there is an eternal justice above
      us, so surely shall this wickedness be atoned for! Aye, smile, and tremble while you smile—for
      you feel that truth speaks out of him, who on his way to the grave, pauses here to give you
      your true titles of knave and coward!</p>
