     <stage>Enter LYDDY PRYSE and HUGH MORGAN, L. H. U. E.</stage>
     <sp who="#L0435_F10">
      <speaker>Lyddy.</speaker>
      <p>Mister Morgan, Mister Morgan, why will you be following me? if you have anything to tell
       me, surely you can do it without treading my shoes down at the heel in this manner; I vow you
       are always hunting me about, like a hawk after a poor pigeon.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0435_M4">
      <speaker>Hugh.</speaker>
      <p>I always hunting you about! well, that is what I call an hyperbole-when all the village
       knows that you come after me as regularly as the objective case after an active verb.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0435_F10">
      <speaker>Lyddy.</speaker>
      <p>The objective case? what do you mean by that, sir?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0435_M4">
      <speaker>Hugh.</speaker>
      <p>Here's a beautiful state of ignorance! don't know the meaning of the objective case! well,
       you certainly are to be pitied; however, I can't afford to teach you grammar gratis- Lindley
       Murray is too valuable a commodity in these parts to be given away, like soup, to the poor.
       Besides my learning is all I have to depend upon.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0435_F10">
      <speaker>Lyddy.</speaker>
      <p>And, consequently you are obliged to be most economical. But don't alarm yourself, Mr.
       Morgan, I don't wan't any of your learning; many's the lady that knows the French for brewing
       and baking and yet isn't able to do it.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0435_M4">
      <speaker>Hugh.</speaker>
      <p>Ah, Lyddy, if your education was only as good as your looks if those two capital eyes of
       yours, as round and as black as two periods, with those beautiful brows arched over them like
       a brace of circumflexes, only understood something of Orthography —and if that sweet little
       parenthesis of a mouth could but rehearse the rules of Syntax—I verily believe
       <pb n="4"/> I might be tempted to offer to go through the first conjugation with you
       myself-Amo, I love; Amas, thou lovest, &amp;c.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0435_F10">
      <speaker>Lyddy.</speaker>
      <p>And if you did, perhaps you might find that I know enough grammar to decline.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0435_M4">
      <speaker>Hugh.</speaker>
      <p>Decline an offer! I rather think I should find you knew more of prudence than to do that.
       No, no, Miss Lyddy, man is a substantive, and can exist by itself, but woman is a noun
       objective, and requires to be joined to something else. Now your cousin Gwynneth
        <emph>can</emph> afford to be fastidious, she <emph>isn't</emph> turned of twenty-four,
        <emph>she may</emph> indulge in the luxury of a no, but there <emph>is</emph> a certain
       party——however, I've no wish to hurt your feelings, age is venerable, as the copy book
       says.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0435_F10">
      <speaker>Lyddy.</speaker>
      <p>Go on, sir! pray don't mind me! get rid of all your spleen! However, I can tell you this,
       that even if I were four and twenty—which I am not—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0435_M4">
      <speaker>Hugh.</speaker>
      <p>Of course not! age with women, is always an <hi>indefinite article</hi>——but I beg your
       pardon, even if you <hi>were</hi> five and twenty—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0435_F10">
      <speaker>Lyddy.</speaker>
      <p>Yes, sir! and you the only bachelor in the world, I'd rather devote my whole life to
       celibacy and cats, than put up with such a make—shift of a man as yourself. Now, Mr. Owen
       Williams <hi>is</hi> a man.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0435_M4">
      <speaker>Hugh.</speaker>
      <p>Owen Williams a man! well that is a good one! why there's no more spirit in him than in a
       jug of table beer. Do you think <hi>I'd</hi> ever become the slave of any of your sex? Do you
       think <hi>I'd</hi> ever dangle at the heels of any female, like a log of wood after a strayed
       mare? Do you think I'd ever permit any silly girl to make me jealous? No, not if she were a
        <hi>Venus</hi> and a <hi> Plutus</hi> rolled into one.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0435_F10">
      <speaker>Lyddy.</speaker>
      <p>Oh! don't alarm yourself, sir, no one will ever make you jealous, depend on't you've no
       more love in you than a lobster, and possess about as much heart as a perriwinkle.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0435_M4">
      <speaker>Hugh.</speaker>
      <p>Ah! now you're growing spiteful, angry at my deficiency in that respect, wish I'd a little
       more of the commodity, eh? Anxious to supply me with a small quantity yourself. Well, I don't
       know, but I might go to a worse shop for it. Let's have a kiss now, by way of sample, Lyddy,
       and I promise you if I like the article, I'll give you an order for a gross.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0435_F10">
      <speaker>Lyddy.</speaker>
      <p>Ay, but on what terms, Hugh?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0435_M4">
      <speaker>Hugh.</speaker>
      <p>Humph! d'ye give any credit?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0435_F10">
      <speaker>Lyddy.</speaker>

      <speaker>Lyddy.</speaker>
      <p>No, but you men are not to be trusted—only give you credit, and you will soon make a

      <p>Be quiet with you, do! See —yonder comes Evan Pritchard! I cannot bear the look of that
       man—there is a terrible brilliancy in his eye which makes me tremble in his sight, for all
       the world like the poor birds with the serpent I've heard you tell of. So I shall leave you
       to him and I say, Hugh, if you <hi>should</hi> buy me a fairing, do let it be something else
       than a grammar or a spelling book, this time.</p>

      <speaker>Hugh.</speaker>
      <p>Why, truly, that is the Achilles' heel—the only vulnerable point with people now—a—days;
       but there are exceptions to the rule, now the most direct road to my heart is down my throat;
       it's astonishing how much better I think of the world after a good dinner.</p>

      <speaker>Hugh.</speaker>
      <p>Can't say, I'm sure, never having studied the geography of that quarter; but I should say
       that a few month's reading, writing, and arithmetic would put any one in a fair way to it.
       Spelling's everything in a love letter; you've heard of love spells—means correct
       orthography—you can't tell the advantages of learning.</p>

      <p>Joy! a feeling that even those who love not, sometimes have. No! 'tis <hi>more</hi> than
       that: it is the consummation of the hopes that her young life has cherished—that one would be
       to her a haven against the perils of the world; it is the fear that time may change her, and
       that the love she hath inspired may die within him. These are the feelings of a happy bride;

       contended with miseries that mock the imagination—I have struggled with the great sea—I have
       fought with disease that must have conquered—but for the one faint hope that Gwynneth Vaughan
       might yet be mine. I come home again and find my early <hi>friend</hi>, by a villain's arts,

       a mother's declining years, and to temper the punishment allotted to Gwynneth Vaughan.</p>
