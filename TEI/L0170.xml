brought forth the following good-humoured protest from Punch:- "A Penny Saved
And A Punch Got. Mr. Punch presents his compliments to Mr. Planche, and will
trouble that gentleman to request Mrs. Stirling to make a slight addition to an
exceedingly proper observation she offers as Comedy,' in the very pleasant piece
'The Camp at the Olympic.' Mrs. Stirling remarks, in her very happiest stage
manner ' And who for wit in comedy would seek, When Punch himself is but a groat
a week '? To prevent unhappiness and misconception, would Mr. Planche add
something of this kind ? 'Fourpence, I mean, to country friends supplies him,
The favoured Londoner for threepence buys him.' With this addition 'The Camp'
will become a charming little piece."</note></l>
