<p>No servant of mine ever took such liberties as   you do; you have been with
me too long, Warner.</p>

husband?</p>

<p>Well, ma, if he is to be my husband, I dare say I shall have plenty of
letters from him some day or other.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0526_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p>Harriet, you provoke me by your indifference; look at Mr. Omnium's money and
then look at your own: but you can't look at your own, for you have got none to
look at.</p>

letters, L. and R., on table. Omnium discovered asleep on a sofa; a book is in

<sp who="#L0526_M3">
<speaker>Grim.</speaker>
<p>There he is, fast asleep over his favourite book, “Hints on Matrimony.” What

<p>You frightened me I can tell you.</p>

<p>Frighten a soldier?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0526_M3">

<p>I'm not a soldier now; when I was I argued in this way—Her Majesty pays
me—</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Omnium.</speaker>
<p>None of your everlasting arguments, they make my head ache.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0526_M3">
<speaker>Grim.</speaker>
<p>Perhaps they do, but, they lost a capital soldier, when they turned me out of
the army for arguing. No   man ever obeyed orders better when I was once
convinced they were right.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0526_M1">
<speaker>Omnium.</speaker>
<p>Soldiers and servants should do as they're told and ask no questions.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0526_M3">
<speaker>Grim.</speaker>

<speaker>Omnium.</speaker>
<p>Go!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0526_M3">
<speaker>Grim.</speaker>
<p>There it is again, that's an order: but if I obey it and go, how are you to
know why I came?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0526_M1">
<speaker>Omnium.</speaker>
<p>Confound you, why did you come then?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0526_M3">
<speaker>Grim.</speaker>
<p>To tell you that a friend of yours called just now.</p>

<p>Why didn't you shew him up?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0526_M3">
<speaker>Grim.</speaker>
<p>He couldn't stop, he had just come up from the country and was obliged to go
a little further, but he'll soon be back, and hopes you won't leave home till he
has seen you.</p>

<p>Why not?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0526_M3">
<speaker>Grim.</speaker>
<p>I've been told to open the street door, and I did it—I've been told I'm to
ask no questions, and I didn't. <stage>(aside)</stage> Had him there I
think!</p>
</sp>

<p>  The same rules don't apply in every case.</p>
</sp>

<p>Good gracious, no! Had he any one with him?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0526_M3">

that admits of argument.</p>

“Mr. Omnium—Your attentions to my step-daughter have become the subject of
general remark. I cannot suppose that you mean to trifle with her feelings, but
understand distinctly that I don't mean to allow you. As you hesitate to put the
question to her, I shall put a very direct one to you—do you mean to marry my

I won't —anything is better than suspense. Why not send a bold refusal at once?
I'm not to be bullied into marrying!— as to her threats about law, I have plenty
of money to pay if that's all, and as to wives, there are plenty of them to be
had; such a nice dear girl as Charlotte Manifest perhaps—if I dared think of
her—with a hundred attractions, and no mother-in-law—no mother-in-law! I won't
hesitate another instant. <stage>(sits down to write)</stage> “Madam—   the
peremptory nature of your letter leaves no time for consideration. I have every
respect for Miss Pointer, and I hope and believe that I feel as I ought about
you,”—she may make what she likes out of that—“but there is also a respect due
to myself, and thus driven into a corner, I feel it my duty, with all becoming
expression of regret, to write the painful monosyllable ‘No.’—Your obedient
servant, Jacob Omnium.” <stage>(folds and addresses the note)</stage> “To Mrs.

done right, now; it is terrible to be hurried so—what shall I do? Ah! I have it,
chance shall decide—chance has been my friend all my life, and it often decides
better for us than we can for ourselves. Marriage is said to be a lottery, and a
lottery I'll make of it,—I'll write another letter to say “yes,” and draw lots
for which I shall send. <stage>(returns to table and writes)</stage>
“Madam,—Your letter seems to assure me of success with your charming
step-daughter, though I have never ventured to make any proposal; pray assure
Miss Pointer of my devotion, and believe that my opinion of <hi>you</hi> remains
