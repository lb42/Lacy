        easy chairs; couch, L.; fire-place, R.; clock, C.; chairs, &amp;c.; table, R., on it a
        lighted lamp; closet at back, L.</stage>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(entering, door c.)</stage> Yes, yes, godfather, make your mind easy, you may
          sleep quietly on both sides of your face. <stage>(advancing)</stage> That’s a saying in
          our parts; but I have tried it, and I couldn’t do it. <stage>(looking at clock)</stage>
          Seven o’clock! what a litter this room is in. <stage>(placing chairs, &amp;c.)</stage> And
          look here. <stage>(indicating clothes scattered over an easy chair)</stage> What’s all
          this? Oh, old master’s morning gown. <stage>(places it in the closet)</stage> I have an
          idea that this place of mine suits me very well. I am boarded and lodged and washed, eight
          pounds a year, and the key of the cellar. I fancy I shall soon get my nose red in this
          house. <stage>(sits)</stage> This here easy chair is uncommon comfortable.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(entering, c. door, a portmanteau in his hand)</stage> I don’t see a soul about.
            <stage>(seeing Simon)</stage> Eh! halloa, my friend! <stage>(shaking him)</stage> What
          are you doing there?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(all aback)</stage> Me, sir! I—I’m a doing my work.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Doing what?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(rising)</stage> What do you please to want?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>I wish to see Mr. or Mrs. Mitchell.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>Oh! either of them would do, then?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(l. c.)</stage> Yes.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(r. c.)</stage> That’s lucky, for they are both gone out.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Out! then I will await their return.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>I don’t think you will, sir.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>How do you mean?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>Why, when master and missus went away this morning, they said they were going on a visit,
          and should be away nine or ten days—and the same number of nights too, no doubt.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(aside)</stage> Pleasant information! all this distance from London, and not a
          shilling in my pocket. <stage>(to Simon)</stage> Are you alone here?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>Yes, I’m quite alone in the house, except my godfather, who lives at the bottom of the
          garden.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>The surly old brute I met in the park?</p>
      </sp>

      <pb n="4"/>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>Yes, that’s godfather.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Agreeable society! Well, I must teach myself resignation. <stage>(offering
            portmanteau)</stage> Go and prepare a chamber for me.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>You are labouring under a mistake, sir; the Golden Lion is on the other side of——</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Ah, true! you do not know me. I am Fra——<stage>(checking himself)</stage> No, I mean
          Harry Mitchell, your master’s grandson.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>Really! well, how lucky! I have a letter for your brother.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>For my brother Frank?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>Yes, here it is. <stage>(drawing a letter from his pocket)</stage> I have been ordered to
          post it.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(aside)</stage> I know what are its contents—the old story—you are a
          good-for-nothing fellow, and I shall not give you a sixpence. <stage>(aloud, taking letter
            and putting it into his pocket)</stage> All right, I will take care he has it.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>And so you are Master Harry, eh? You are the favourite, you are.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>How did you learn that?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>Godfather has made me acquainted with all the family matters, for I am quite fresh, I
          am.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>You are quite fresh! what do you mean?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>I mean I was quite new this morning. Godfather brought me here and showed me to your
          grandmother just as she was stepping into the old family coach; she had only just time to
          say, “Oh! this is the stupid animal you have told me about.” You see, she is so old that
          she doesn’t always know what she is talking about.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>I think, though, her faculties were pretty clear this morning. But, as you say, she is
          rather old—eighty-two. Considerably wrinkled, I should think.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>Her face is just like a little apple that has been dried in the sun.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>And my grandfather?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>He is like a little pear that has been baked in an oven.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>I am certain I should not recognize them; they must be very dull here, all by
          themselves.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>Godfather says that they sometimes yawn till they get a lock-jaw; that’s why they have
          just advertised in the papers for somebody to read to them.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Read to them!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>Yes, a young lady.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(quickly)</stage> Ah, there is a young lady here?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>No, sir, she hasn’t come yet.</p>
      </sp>

      <pb n="5"/>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>What a pity!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>And they won’t want a young lady now they have engaged me.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(laughing)</stage> But you are not a young lady.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>No, and I can’t read, but——</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Idiot! go and prepare my chamber.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(going, l.)</stage> Yes, Master Harry.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Stop a moment; is there anything to eat in the pantry?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>I saw the plate chest there; but I’ll go and see, Master Harry. Ah! if you were Mr.
          Frank.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Well?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>I shouldn’t be able to find anything. <stage>(confidentially)</stage> Godfather says that
          you are a pet, and that your brother is a bad lot; old folks won’t have him at any
          price.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(aside)</stage> I know it but too well. <stage>(aloud)</stage> You will find some
          cigars in my portmanteau, with my pipe and tobacco. Stay; have you got the keys of the
          cellar?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>Yes, sir.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Then bring me some champagne.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
        <p>I will. <stage>(aside)</stage> He’ll help me, I can see, to redden my nose!</p>
      </sp>

      <stage>Exit, with portmanteau, door, L.</stage>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Have I done well to present myself here under my brother’s name, because I know their
          great preference for him, and that they treat me like a Cinderella of the male sex. This
          is the way I discovered that I was no favourite; one day I wrote to them for money, and
          didn’t get it: while Harry, who had also written for some, did: then I questioned myself
          as to what I had done, and as to what I had not done. I said to myself, it is nearly
          twelve years since Harry and I quitted the old people; we are of the same figure,
          considerably resemble each other; I could easily impose upon my grandmother, who is nearly
          blind, and ditto upon my grandfather, who is quite deaf, and so I will go to them and say
          here is your darling Harry, and express my willingness to receive as much money as they
          choose to give me; if my brother were to write I should be there to suppress his letters.
          Wasn’t that a clever idea? not particularly honest, but remarkably clever; that will teach
          parents to have a preference, to all respectable grandfathers one grandson is as good as
          another.</p>

        <p>I thank you. But the Mr. Mitchell of whom I asked you is the husband of Mrs. Mitchell,
          and I do not suppose that——</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>No, certainly; I have not married my grandmother, that sort of thing is not allowed, you
          know. <stage>(aside)</stage> She is deucedly pretty. <stage>(aloud)</stage> Will you have

        <p>Then your grandfather is also absent.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>For nine or ten days. I am quite alone here, but that makes no difference. <stage>(again

      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>No, thank you. I believe I cannot do better than make my way back to the railway station,

        <p>I believed I had been recommended to them by Mr. Dunstable, as a companion to——</p>

        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Certainly, quite correct. <stage>(aside)</stage> She mustn’t go, I want a companion,

      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>Ah, you have a brother?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Yes, Harry—hem, no—I mean, Frank—I am Harry.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>But, according to what Mr. Dunstable told me, one of you is a very bad fellow.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>It isn’t me; I assure you, it’s my brother.</p>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>Are you quite certain?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Quite certain that I am not my brother—oh, yes. But, after all, Frank is really a capital
          fellow; he is, I assure <pb n="7"/>you, I like him very much; I do, indeed—may have been a
          little wild, but——</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>Pardon me, sir, but your grandmother does not return.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>She is taking a little walk in the park, and perhaps her corns are troublesome—she has
          several, besides two or three bunions! but perhaps she has come in and gone to bed—she is
          subject to—to—to the whooping cough——</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>The what, sir?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(aside)</stage> Confound it! I can’t think of—<stage>(aloud)</stage> I mean the
          gout—and she always goes to bed early when—but you will see her to-morrow.</p>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(taking her portmanteau from Frank’s hand)</stage> To-morrow? in that case I will
          go to the Golden Lion Hotel, which is near the railway station.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(again taking portmanteau from her hand)</stage> No, no—grandmother would be so
          angry—she has caused a chamber to be prepared for you.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>Indeed!</p>

      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>And I should be glad to know what you are doing in my house at this hour of the

      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(r. c.)</stage> Well, the fact is—<stage>(aside)</stage> The devil, though, I
          can’t tell her in this dress that I am her grandson.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(going up)</stage> If you don’t answer, I shall call Simon to bundle you out.</p>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(aside)</stage> Ah! <stage>(aloud)</stage> I am the companion.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>You a companion at your age?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Yes, ma’am, I am a widow.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>But Dunstable wrote to me that she was young and pretty; and you are as old as the

      <pb n="15"/>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Oh, no! but I have seen so much trouble.</p>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>And you are ugly—downright ugly.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Well, beauty is all a matter of opinion.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>And look here, what is this? <stage>(taking Frank by the arm and making him pass before
            her)</stage> Wine, cigars, a pipe, in my house! gracious goodness!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(l. c.)</stage> I was going to tell you—it’s your grandson.</p>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(r. c.)</stage> My grandson?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Yes, Harry—he is here—and the pipe— <stage>(aside)</stage> I shall bolt.
            <stage>(aloud)</stage> I will inform him of your arrival.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(clutching his arm)</stage> No, never mind, I shall see him to-morrow.
            <stage>(looking at him and starting)</stage> Why, can I believe my eyes? that’s one of
          my gowns you have on.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(aside)</stage> Oh, lord!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>And that is my bonnet.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>I’ll tell you how it happened——</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>And that mantle is mine, too.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Well, as to the mantle——</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>You are a pretty companion—you are a thief.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>A thief!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>Yes, one of the female swell mob. I’ll send Simon for the police.</p>
      </sp>

      <stage>FRANK runs off, C. door.</stage>

      <p><stage>(laughing)</stage> Now, Mr. Harry, I think we are equal. It is too late to-night to
        go to the Golden Lion; so I will stay here, retain this costume, and——</p>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(without)</stage> My grandmother arrived!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>Ah! he is returning. I did not bargain for that. <stage>(going over to l.)</stage> But he
          will not suspect, and——</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(running on, door c.)</stage> Grandmother, grandmother, embrace your little

      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(retreating)</stage> No, no, certainly not.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Then you no longer love your little grandson?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>You are a wicked boy.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Oh, grandmother!</p>

        <p>Poor Jane!</p>

        <p><stage>(aside)</stage> Who is she, I wonder?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>After having been so long engaged to marry her, everything prepared, the wedding day
          fixed, all at once you write that you have altered your mind, and don’t intend to marry
          yet awhile, leaving poor Jane to break her heart and die.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Really, I am very sorry for poor Jane—though, ’pon my soul, I don’t know who she is.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>Oh, Harry, Harry!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Ah! I see how it is; you think I am Harry.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
        <speaker>Adela.</speaker>
        <p>Well?</p>

        <p>I am free to confess that I am, and the proof <stage>(drawing papers from his

      <sp>
        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(finding letter that has been given him by Simon)</stage> Yes, here it is; look at
          that; the letter which you wrote to me. <stage>(reading)</stage> “My dear Frank,” you see,
          “your brother Harry is a bad fellow; tell him from us that unless he becomes within a
          week, the husband of poor Jane, we have done with him for ever.”</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>

        <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
        <p>Well, grandmother, you won’t have to wait long; there is now in this house a charming
