     <head>SCENE, An apartment in Freeman's house.</head>
     <stage>Enter Freeman and Lovel, L.</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Free.</speaker>
      <p><stage>(R.)</stage> A country boy! ha, ha, ha! How long has this scheme been in your
       head?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p><stage>(L.)</stage>Some time.— I am now convinced of what you have often <corr>been</corr>
       hinting to me, that I am confoundedly cheated by my servants.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Free.</speaker>
      <p>Oh, are you satisfied at last, Mr. Lovel, I always told you, that there is not a worse set
       of servants in the parish of St. James's than in your kitchen.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>'Tis with some difficulty I believe it now, Mr. Freeman; though, I must own, my expenses
       often make me stare.— Philip, I am sure— is an honest fellow; and I will swear for my blacks—
       If there is a rogue among my folks, it is that surly dog Tom.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Free.</speaker>
      <p>You are mistaken in every one. Philip is an hypocritical rascal; Tom has a good deal of
       surly honesty about him; and for your blacks, they are as bad as your whites.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>
        Pray tell me; is not your Robert acquainted with my people? Perhaps
       he may give a little light into the thing.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Free.</speaker>
      <p>To tell you the truth, Mr. Lovel, your servants are so abandoned, that I have forbid him
       your house. However, if you have a mind to ask him any question, he shall be forthcoming.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>Let us have him.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Free.</speaker>
      <p>You shall: But it is an hundred to one if you get any thing out of him; for though he is a
       very honest fellow,
       <pb n="4"/>yet he is so much of a servant, that he'll never tell any thing to the
       disadvantage of another.—Who waits?— <subst> <del><stage>[Enter servant.]</stage></del>

      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>This letter. It is an anonymous one, and so ought not to be regarded; but it has something
       honest in it, and put me upon satisfying my curiosity—Read it.</p>
      <stage>(Gives the letter.)</stage>

     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>I should know something of this hand— <stage>(reads)</stage> <quote type="letter"> To
       Peregrine Lovel, Esq— Please your honour,I take the liberty to acquaint your honour, that you
       are— sadly cheated by your servants—Your honour will find it as I say—I am not willing to be
       known; whereof, if I am, it may bring one into trouble. So no more from your honour's Servant
       to command.</quote> —Odd and honest! Well—and now what are the steps you intend to take?

     </sp>
     
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>My plan is this—I gave it out that I was going to my <subst> <del>borough</del>
       <add>house</add> </subst> in Devonshire; and yesterday set out with my servant in great form,
       and lay at Basingstoke—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Free.</speaker>
      <p>Well?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>I ordered the fellow to make the best of his way down into the country, and told him that I
       would follow him; instead of that. I turned back, and am just come to town.—
       </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Free.</speaker>
      <p>How will you get in?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>When I am properly habited, you shall get me introduced to Philip as one of your tenants
       sons, who wants to be made a good servant of.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Free.</speaker>
      <p>They will certainly discover you.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>Never fear; I'll be so countryfied, that you shall not
       <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0831500200:5"/> know me. As they are thoroughly persuaded I am many miles
       off, they'll be more easily imposed on. Ten to one but they begin to celebrate my departure
       with a drinking bout, if they are what you describe them-</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Free.</speaker>
      <p>Here is Robert.</p>

     <stage>Enter Robert, L.</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rob.</speaker>
      <p>You ordered me to wait on you, sir.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Free.</speaker>
      <p>I did, Robert.—Robert—</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>Rob.</speaker>
      <p>Sir— <stage>(crosses, C.)</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <pb n="5"/>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Free.</speaker>
      <p>Come here. You know, Robert, I have a good opinion of your integrity.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rob.</speaker>
      <p>I have always endeavoured that your honour should.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Free.</speaker>
      <p>Pray, have not you some acquaintance among Mr. Lovel's people?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rob.</speaker>
      <p>A little, please your honour.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Free.</speaker>
      <p>How do they behave?—We have nobody but friends—you may speak out.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>Ay, Robert, speak out.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rob.</speaker>
      <p>I hope your honours will not insist on my saying any thing in an affair of this kind.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>Oh, but we do insist—If you know any thing—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rob.</speaker>
      <p>Sir, I am but a servant myself; and it would not become me to speak ill of a
       brother-servant.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Free.</speaker>
      <p>Psha! this is false honesty—speak out.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rob.</speaker>
      <p>Don't oblige me, good Sir. Consider, Sir, a servant's bread depends upon his carackter.
      </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>But if a servant uses me ill—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rob.</speaker>
      <p>Alas, Sir! what is one man's poison is another man's meat.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Free.</speaker>
      <p>You see how they trim for one another.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rob.</speaker>
      <p>Service, Sir, is no inheritance.—A servant that is not approved in one place, may give
       satisfaction in another. Every body must live, your honour.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>I like your heartiness as well as your caution; but in my case, it is necessary that I
       should know the truth.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rob.</speaker>
      <p>The truth, Sir, is not to be spoken at all times: it may bring one into trouble, whereof

     </sp>
     
     <sp>
      <speaker>Free.</speaker>
      <p>I ask you if you were concerned in writing this letter? You never told me a lie yet, and I

      <p>Pray, your honour, don't ask me.</p>

      <p>Did you write it?—Answer me.</p>

      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>What induced you to do it?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rob.</speaker>
      <p>I will tell the truth. I have seen such waste and extravagance, and riot and drunkenness,
       in your kitchen, Sir, that as my master's friend, I could not help discovering it to you.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>Go on.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rob.</speaker>
      <p>I am sorry to say it to your honour, but your honour is not only imposed on, but laughed at
       by all your servants especially by Philip, who is — a very bad man.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>Philip.? An ungrateful dog! — well?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rob.</speaker>
      <p>I could not presume to speak to your honour; and therefore I resolved, though but a poor
       scribe, to write your honour a letter.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>Robert, I am greatly indebted to you—Here— <stage>(offers money)</stage> </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Rob.</speaker>
      <p>On any other account than this, I should be proud to receive your honour's bounty; but now
       I beg to be excused. <stage>(refuses the money)</stage> </p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p><stage>(C.)</stage>Thou hast a noble heart, Robert, and I'll not forget you. — Freeman, he
       must be in the secret.— Wait your master's orders.</p>

      <p>I will, your honour.</p>

      <p>Well sir, are you convinced now?</p>

      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>Convinced? Yes; and I'll be among the scoundrels before night. You or Robert must contrive
       some way or other to get me introduced to Philip as one of your cottagers boys out of

      <p>Credit me, baronet, they knew nothing of the turf.</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Sir Har.</speaker>
      <p>I assure you, my lord, they lost every match; for Crab was beat hollow, Careless threw his

      <p>The fact is, the city people practice so much adultery that I always import my own snuff—I
       wish my lord would do the same; but he is so nindolent—When did you see the girls? I saw lady
       Bab this morning; but, 'fore Gad, whether it be love or reading, she looked as pale as a
       penitent.</p>

      <p> Sir Harry, I have the pleasure of informing you, that your absence has given his grace an

      <speaker>Sir H.</speaker>
      <p>Mr. Philip, Mrs. Kitty, Lady Bab, Lady Charlotte, and the rest of the nobs and gentry
       present, I do not possess the noble duke’s horticultural powers of auricular oratory; I have
       not, like the illustrious duke, | received a classified hedication; but still unable as I is
       to exasperate my sense of the obligation you have done yourselves—that is, myself—in drinking
       your health —that is, my health. Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking—as Shakespeare says
       in his translation of Paradise Lost, “proper queer marrowbones umbie,” which, for the benefit
       of our fair friends, may be translated, “you can’t make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear. Now
       them’s my sentiments, and to hact up to them sentiments shall ever be my highest
       perspiration. Before I sits down on my seat, I begs to propoge a toast and sentimental
       sentiment: "May the tar wot has lost one leg in the service of his country, never live to see
       the want of tobacco with the other. <stage>(sits)</stage></p>

      <p>Sir, I have not the honour to be known to you, but I have the honour to serve His Grace the
       Duke of—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>And the impudence familiarly to assume his title. Your grace will give me leave to tell
       you, that is the door.<stage>(Duke crossing, L., bowing)</stage>— and if you ever enter there
       again, I assure you, my lord duke, I will break every bone in your grace's

      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>But you Sir, for your villany, and (what I hate worse) your hypocrisy, shall not stay a
       minute longer in the house; and here comes an honest man to shew you the way out. Your keys,
       sir.</p>

     <stage>Enter Tom, L.</stage>
     <p>Tom, I respect and value you. You are an honest servant and shall never want encouragement.
      Be so good, Tom as to see that gentleman out of my house <stage>(points to
      Philip.)</stage>—and then take charge of the cellar and plate.</p>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
      <p>I thank your honour; but I would not rise on the ruin of a fellow servant.</p>

      <p><add>And I intend to make your Robert so, too. Every honest servant should be made
       happy;</add> and if persons of rank would truly act up to their station it would be
       impossible that their servants could ape them; — but when they descend to what is ridiculous,
       it will be in the power of any low creature to follow their example.</p>
