   <stage type="setting">Scene —A Room, decently furnished; at c. a bed, with curtains closed; at L
    . C . a door; at 3 E . L . a door; at 2 E . L . a chest of drawers; at back, R ., a window; at 3
    E . R . a door ; at 2 E . R . a fireplace, with mantelpiece; table and chairs; a few common
    ornaments on chimney-piece. </stage>
   <stage>Cox, dressed, with the exception of his coat, is looking at himself in a small
    looking-glass, which he holds in his hand. </stage>
   <sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> I've half a mind to register an oath that I'll never have my hair cut again! <stage>(his hair
     is very short)</stage>I look as if I had just been cropped for the Militia! And I was
    particularly emphatic in my instructions to the hair-dresser only to cut the ends off. He must
    have thought I meant the other ends ! Never mind—I shan't meet anybody to care about so early.
    Eight o'clock, I declare! I haven't a moment to lose. Fate has placed me with the most punctual,
    particular, and peremptory of hatters, and I must fulfil my destiny. <stage>(knock at l. c.
     d.)</stage>Open locks, whoever knocks!</p> </sp>
   <stage> Enter MRS. BOUNCER. </stage>
  <sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> Good morning, Mr. Cox. I hope you slept comfortably, Mr. Cox ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> I can't say I did, Mrs. B. I should feel obliged to you, if you could accommodate me with a
    more protuberant bolster, Mrs. B. The one I've got now seems to me to have about a handful and a
    half of feathers at each end, and nothing whatever in the middle.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> Anything to accommodate you, Mr. Cox.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Thank you. Then perhaps you'll be good enough to hold this glass, while I finish my
    toilet.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs B.</speaker>
   <p> B. Certainly. <stage>(holding glass before Cox, who ties on his cravat)</stage>Why, I do
    declare, you've had your hair cut!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Cut ? It strikes me I've had it mowed! It's very kind of you to mention it, but I'm
    sufficiently conscious of the absurdity of my personal appearance already. <stage>(puts on his
     coat)</stage>Now for my hat― <stage>(puts on his hat, which comes over his eyes)</stage>That's
    the effect of having one's hair cut. This hat fitted me quite tight <pb n="4"/> before. Luckily I've got two
    or three more. <stage>(goes in at l. d. and returns, with three hats of different shapes, and
     puts them on, one after the other — all of which are too big for him)</stage>This is pleasant!
    Never mind. This one appears to me to wabble about rather less than the others <stage>(puts on
     hat)</stage>and now I'm off! By the bye, Mrs. Bouncer, I wish to call your attention to a fact
    that has been evident to me for some time past—and that is, that my coals go remarkably
    fast―</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> Lor, Mr. Cox !</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> It is not only the case with the coals, Mrs. Bouncer, but I've lately observed a gradual and
    steady increase of evaporation among my candles, wood, sugar, and lucifer matches.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> Lor, Mr. Cox ! you surely don't suspect me ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> I don't say I do, Mrs. B.; only I wish you distinctly to understand, that I don't believe
    it's the cat.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p>
    Is there anything else you've got to grumble about, sir?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Grumble! Mrs. Bouncer, do you possess such a thing as a dictionary ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> No, sir.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Then I'll lend you one—and if you turn to the letter G., you'll find "Grumble, verb
    neuter—to complain without a cause." Now that's not my case, Mrs. B. And now that we are upon
    the subject, I wish to know how it is that I frequently find my apartment full of smoke ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> Why—I suppose the chimney―</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> The chimney doesn't smoke tobacco. I'm speaking of tobacco smoke, Mrs. B. I hope, Mrs. .
    B.uncer, <emph>you're</emph> not guilty of cheroots or cubas ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> Not I, indeed, Mr. Cox.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Nor partial to a pipe ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> No, sir.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Then how is it that―</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(confused)</stage>Why—I suppose—yes—that must be it― </p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox.</speaker>
   <p>At present, I am entirely of your opinion—because I haven't the most distant particle of an
    idea what you mean.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> Why, the gentleman who has got the attics, is hardly ever without a pipe in his mouth—and
    there he sits, with his feet on the mantel-piece―</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> The mantel-piece! That strikes me as being a considerable stretch, either of your
    imagination, Mrs. B., or the gentleman's legs. I presume you mean the fender or the hob.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> Sometimes one, sometimes t'other. Well, there he sits for hours, and puffs away into the
    fire-place.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Ah, then you mean to say, that this gentleman's smoke, instead of emulating the example of
    all other sorts of smoke, and going <emph>up</emph> the chimney, thinks proper to affect a
    singularity by taking the contrary direction ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs B.</speaker>
   <p> B. Why―</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Then I suppose, the gentleman you are speaking of, is the same individual that I invariably
    meet coming up stairs when I'm going down, and going down when I'm coming up ?</p>
   </sp>
  <pb n="5"/><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> Why―yes—I―</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> From the appearance of his outward man, I should unhesitatingly set him down as a gentleman
    connected with the printing interest.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> Yes, sir—and a very respectable young gentleman he is.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Well, good morning, Mrs. Bouncer!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> You'll be back at your usual time, I suppose, sir?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Yes—nine o'clock. You needn't light my fire in future, Mrs. B.—I'll do it myself. Don't
    forget the bolster ! <stage>(going, stops)</stage>A halfpenny worth of milk, Mrs. Bouncer—and be
    good enough to let it stand—I wish the cream to accumulate. <stage>Exit at l. c. d.</stage> </p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> He's gone at last! I declare I was all in a tremble for fear Mr. Box should come in before
    Mr. Cox went out. Luckily, they've never met yet—and what's more, they're not very likely to do
    so: for Mr. Box is hard at work at a newspaper office all night, and doesn't come home till the
    morning, and Mr. Cox is busy making hats all day long, and doesn't come home till night; so that
    I'm getting double rent for my room, and neither of my lodgers are any the wiser for it. It was
    a capital idea of mine— that it was! But I haven't an instant to lose. First of all, let me put
    Mr. Cox's things out of Mr. Box's way. <stage>(she takes the three hats, Cox's dressing gown and
     slippers, opens door at L . and puts them in, then shuts door and locks it)</stage>Now then, to
    put the key where Mr. Cox always finds it. <stage>(puts the key on the ledge of the door L
     .)</stage>I really must beg Mr. Box not to smoke so much. I was so dreadfully puzzled to know
    what to say when Mr. Cox spoke about it. Now, then, to make the bed—and don't let me forget that
    what's the head of the bed for Mr. Cox, becomes the foot of the bed for Mr. Box—peoples' tastes
    do differ so. <stage>(goes behind the curtains of the bed, and seems to be making it — then
     appears with a very thin bolster in her hand)</stage>The idea of Mr. Cox presuming to complain
    of such a bolster as this! <stage>(she disappears again behind curtains)</stage></p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(without)</stage>Pooh—pooh! Why don't you keep your own side of the staircase, sir ?
     <stage>(enters at back, dressed as a Printer — puts his head out at door again,
     shouting)</stage>It was as much your fault as mine, sir! I say, sir—it was as much your fault
    as mine, sir!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(emerging from behind the curtains of bed)</stage>Lor, Mr. Box! what is the matter?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Mind your own business, Bouncer!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> Dear, dear, Mr. Box! what a temper you are in, to be sure! I declare you're quite pale in the
    face !</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> What colour would you have a man he, who has been setting up long leaders for a daily paper
    all night ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> But then, you've all the day to yourself.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(looking significantly at Mrs. Bouncer)</stage>So it seems! Far be it from me, Bouncer,
    to hurry your movements, but I think it right to acquaint you with my immediate intention of
    divesting myself of my garments, and going to bed.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs B.</speaker>
   <p> B. Oh, Mr. Box! <stage>(going)</stage></p>
   </sp><pb n="6"/><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Stop! Can you inform me who the individual is that I invariably encounter going down stairs
    when I'm coming up, and coming up stairs when I'm going down ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(confused)</stage>Oh—yes—the gentleman in the attic, sir.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Oh; There's nothing particularly remarkable about him, except his hats. I meet him in all
    sorts of hats—white hats and black hats—hats with broad brims, and hats with narrow brims- hats
    with naps, and hats without naps—in short, I have come to the conclusion, that he must be
    individually and professionally associated with the hatting interest.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> Yes, sir. And, by-the-bye, Mr. Box, he begged me to request of you, as a particular favour,
    that you would not smoke quite so much.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Did he ? Then you may tell the gentle hatter, with my compliments, that if he objects to the
    effluvia of tobacco, he had better domesticate himself in some adjoining parish.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> Oh, Mr. Box! You surely wouldn't deprive me of a lodger ? <stage>(pathetically)</stage></p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> It would come to precisely the same thing, Bouncer, because if I detect the slightest attempt
    to put my pipe out, I at once give you warning that I shall give you warning at once.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> Well, Mr. Box—do you want anything more of me?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> On the contrary—I've had quite enough of you !</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> Well, if ever ! What next, I wonder ? <stage>(goes out at l. c. d. slamming door after
     her)</stage></p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> It's quite extraordinary, the trouble I always have to get rid of that venerable female ! She
    know I'm up all night, and yet she seems to set her face against my indulging in a horizontal
    position by day. Now, let me see—shall I take my nap before I swallow my breakfast, or shall I
    take my breakfast before I swallow my nap—I mean, shall I swallow my nap before—no— never mind!
    I've got a rasher of bacon somewhere— <stage>(feeling in his pockets)</stage>—I've the most
    distinct and vivid recollection of having purchased a rasher of bacon—Oh, here it is—
     <stage>(produces it, wrapped in paper, and places it on table)</stage>—and a penny roll. The
    next thing is to light the fire. Where are my lucifers ? <stage>(looking on mantel-piece r. and
     taking box, opens it)</stage>Now, 'pon my life, this is too bad of Bouncer—this is, by several
    degrees, too bad ! I had a whole box full, three days ago, and now there's only one! I'm
    perfectly aware that she purloins my coals and my candles, and my sugar—but I did think—oh, yes,
    I did think that my lucifers would be sacred! <stage>(takes candlestick of the mantel-piece, r.
     in which there is a very small end of candle — looks at it)</stage>Now I should like to ask any
    unprejudiced person or persons their opinion touching this candle. In the first place, a candle
    is an article that I don't require, because I'm only at home in the day time—and I bought this
    candle on the first of May—Chimney-sweepers' day —calculating that it would last me three
    months, and here's one week not half over, and the candle three parts gone! <stage>(lights the
     fire — then takes down the gridiron, which is hanging over the fireplace, E.)</stage>Mrs. Bouncer has been using my gridiron ! The last article <pb n="7"/> of consumption that I cooked upon it was a
    pork chop, and now it is powerfully impregnated with the odour of red herrings ! <stage>(places
     gridiron on fire, and then, with a fork, lays rasher of bacon on the gridiron)</stage>How
    sleepy I am, to be sure ! I'd indulge myself with a nap, if there was anybody here to
    superintend the turning of my bacon. <stage>(yawning again)</stage>Perhaps it will turn itself.
    I must lie down—so, here goes— <stage>He lies down on the bed, closing the curtains round him — after
    a short pause</stage> —</p></sp>
   <stage> Enter Cox, hurriedly, L . C .</stage>
   <sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Well, wonders will never cease! Conscious of being eleven minutes and a half behind time. I
    was sneaking into the shop, in a state of considerable excitement, when my venerable employer,
    with a smile of extreme benevolence on his aged countenance, said to me—" Cox, I shan't want you
    to-day—you can have a holiday." Thoughts of "Gravesend and back—fare One Shilling," instantly
    suggested themselves, intermingled with visions of "Greenwich for Fourpence ! " Then came the
    Twopenny Omnibusses, and the Halfpenny boats—in short, I'm quite bewildered! However, I must
    have my breakfast first—that'll give me time to reflect. I've bought a mutton chop, so I shan't
    want any dinner. <stage>(puts chop on table)</stage>Good gracious! I've forgot the bread.
    Holloa! what's this? A roll, I declare. Come that's lucky! Now then, to light the fire. Holloa—
     <stage>(seeing the lucifer box on table)</stage>—who presumes to touch my box of lucifers? Why,
    it's empty! I left one in it—I'll take my oath I did. Heyday! why the fire is lighted Where's
    the gridiron ? <emph>On</emph> the fire, I declare. And what's that on it? Bacon? Bacon it is!
    Well, now, 'pon my life, there is a quiet coolness about Mrs. Bouncer's proceedings
    that's almost amusing. She takes my last lucifer— my coals, and my gridiron, to cook her
    breakfast by ! No, no—I can't stand this! Come out of that! <stage>(pokes fork into bacon, and
     puts it on a plate on the table, then places his chop on the gridiron, which he puts on the
     fire)</stage>Now, then, for my breakfast things. <stage>(taking key, hung up L , opens door L,
     and goes out, slamming the door after him, with a loud noise)</stage></p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(suddenly showing his head from behind curtains)</stage>Come in! if it's you, Mrs. Bouncer—you needn't be afraid. I wonder how long I've been asleep ! <stage>(suddenly
     recollecting)</stage>Goodness gracious —my bacon! <stage>(leaps off bed, and runs to the
     fireplace)</stage>Holloa! what's this? A chop? Whose chop? Mrs. Bouncer's, I'll be bound. She
    thought to cook her breakfast while I was asleep— with <emph>my</emph> coals, too—and my
    gridiron. Ha, ha ! But where's my bacon ? <stage>(seeing it on table)</stage>Here it is. Well,
    'pon my life, Bouncer's going it! And shall I curb my indignation ? Shall I falter in my
    vengeance? No! <stage>(digs the fork into the chop, opens window, and throws chop out—shuts
     window again)</stage>So much for Bouncer's breakfast, and now for my own ! <stage>(with the
     fork he puts the bacon on the gridiron again)</stage>I may as well lay my breakfast things.
     <stage>(goes to mantel-piece at r. takes key out of one of the ornaments, opens door at R . and
     exit, slamming door after him)</stage></p>

     enters with a small tray, on which are tea things. &amp;c. which he places on drawers L . and
     suddenly recollects)</stage>Oh, goodness! my chop! <stage>(running to
    fireplace)</stage>Holloa—what's this? The bacon again! Oh, pooh ! Zounds—confound it—dash it-
    damn it—I can't stand this ! <stage>( pokes fork into bacon, opens window, and flings it out,
     shuts window again, returns to drawers for tea things, and encounters Box coming from his
     cupboard with his tea things — they walk down c. of stage together)</stage>Who are you, sir

   <stage> Mrs. Bouncer runs in at door l. c.</stage>
   <sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> What is the matter? <stage>(Cox and Box seize Mrs. Bouncer by the arm, and drag her
     forward)</stage></p></sp><sp>
    <speaker>Box. </speaker> <p>Instantly remove that hatter ! </p>
   </sp><sp> <speaker>Cox. </speaker><p>Immediately turn out that printer !</p>

   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> Well—but gentlemen—</p>

   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Explain! <stage>(pulling her round to him)</stage></p>

   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Explain! <stage>(pulling her round to him)</stage>Whose room is this?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Yes, woman—whose room is this ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Doesn't it belong to me ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> No!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> There ! You hear, sir—it belongs to me !</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> No—it belongs to both of you ! <stage>(sobbing)</stage></p></sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox. Box.</speaker>
   <p>Both of us ?
   </p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> Oh, dear gentlemen, don't be angry—but you see, this gentleman— <stage>(pointing to
     Box)</stage>—only being at home in the day time, and that gentleman— <stage>(pointing to
     Cox)</stage>—at night, I thought I might venture, until my little back second floor room was
    ready—</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox. Box.</speaker>
   <p>.<stage>(eagerly)</stage>When will your little back second floor room be ready ?—</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p>Why, to-morrow—</p>
   <pb n="9"/>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> I'll take it!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> So will I !</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> Excuse me—but if you both take it, you may just as well stop where you are.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Both .</speaker>
   <p> True.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> I spoke first, sir—</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> With all my heart, sir The little back second floor room is yours, sir—now go—</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Go ? Pooh—pooh !</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
   <p> Now don't quarrel, gentlemen. You see, there used to be a partition here—</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Coxandbox .</speaker>
   <p> Then put it up !</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Mrs. B. </speaker>
   <p>Nay, I'll see if I can't get the other room ready this very day. Now <emph>do</emph> keep your tempers.

   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> I shall not do anything of the sort, sir. <stage>(seating himself at the table opposite
     Box)</stage></p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Very well, sir.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Very well, sir ! However, don't let me prevent <emph>you</emph> from going out.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Don't flatter yourself, sir. <stage>(Cox is about to break a piece of the roll
    off)</stage>Holloa! that's my roll, sir—<stage>(snatches it away—puts a pipe in his mouth, and
     lights it with a piece of tinder—puffs smoke across the table towards Cox)</stage></p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Holloa! What are you about, sir ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> What am I about ? I'm about to smoke.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Wheugh !<stage>(goes to the window at Box's back, and flings it open)</stage></p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Holloa! <stage>(turning round )</stage>Put down that window, sir!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Then put your pipe out, sir!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> There! <stage>(puts pipe on the table)</stage></p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> There! <stage>(slams down window, and re-seats himself)</stage></p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> I shall retire to my pillow. <stage>(gets up, takes off his jacket, then goes towards bed and
     sits upon it, L . C .)</stage></p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(jumps up, goes to bed and sits down on r. of Box)</stage>I beg your pardon, sir—I cannot

   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p>
    <emph>Your</emph> bed ? Hark ye, sir—can you fight ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> No, sir.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> No ? Then come on—<stage>(sparring at Cox)</stage></p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Sit down, sir—or I'll instantly vociferate " Police! "</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(seats himself—Cox does the same)</stage>I say, sir —</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Well, sir?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Although we are doomed to occupy the same room for a few hours longer, I don't see any
    necessity for our cutting each other's throat, sir.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Not at all. It's an operation that I should decidedly object to.</p>
   </sp><pb n="10"/><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> And, after all, I've no violent animosity against you, sir.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Nor have I any rooted antipathy to you, sir.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Besides, it was all Mrs. Bouncer's fault, sir.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Entirely, sir. <stage>(gradually approaching chairs)</stage></p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Very well, sir!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Very well, sir ! <stage>(pause)</stage></p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Take a bit of roll, sir ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Thank ye, sir. <stage>(breaking a bit off—pause)</stage></p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Do you sing, sir?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> I sometimes join in a chorus. .</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Then give us a chorus. <stage>(pause)</stage>Have you seen the Bosjesmans, sir?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> No, sir—my wife wouldn't let me.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p>
    <emph>Your <emph>wife!</emph></emph>
   </p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> That is—my <emph>intended</emph> wife.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Well, that's the same thing! I congratulate you! <stage>(shaking hands)</stage></p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(with a deep sigh)</stage>Thank ye. <stage>(seeing Box about to get up)</stage>You
    needn't disturb yourself, sir. She won't come here.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Oh! I understand. You've got a snug little establishment of your own <emph>here</emph> —on
    the sly—cunning dog—— <stage>(nudging Cox)</stage></p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(drawing himself up)</stage>No such thing, sir—I repeat, sir—no such thing, sir! but my
    wife—I mean, my <emph>intended</emph> wife happens to be the proprietor of a considerable number
    of bathing machines—</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(suddenly)</stage>Ha! Where ? <stage>(grasping Cox's arm)</stage></p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> At a favourite watering-place. How curious you are!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Not at all. Well?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Consequently, in the bathing season—which luckily is rather a long one—we see but little of
    each other; but as that is now over, I am daily indulging in the expectation of being blessed
    with the sight of <emph>my</emph> beloved. <stage>(very seriously)</stage>Are <emph>you</emph>
    married.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Me ? Why—not exactly !</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Ah—a happy bachelor ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Why—not—precisely !</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Oh ! a—widower ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> No—not absolutely!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> You'll excuse me, sir—but, at present, I don't exactly understand how you can help being one
    of the three.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Not help it?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> No, sir—not you, nor any other man alive!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Ah, that may be—but I'm not alive!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(pushing back his chair)</stage>You'll excuse me, sir—but I don't like joking upon such
    subjects.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> But I'm perfectly serious, sir. I've been defunct for the last three years!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(shouting)</stage>Will you be quiet, sir ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> If you won't believe me, I'll refer you to a very large, numerous, and respectable circle of
    disconsolate friends.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> My very dear sir—my <emph>very</emph> dear sir—if there does exist any ingenious contrivance
    whereby a man on the eve of committing <pb n="11"/> matrimony can leave this world, and yet stop in it, I
    shouldn't be sorry to know it.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Oh! then I presume I'm not to set you down as being frantically attached to your intended
    ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Why, not exactly; and yet, at present, I'm only aware of one obstacle to my doating upon her,
    and that is, that I can't abide her.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Then there's nothing more easy. Do as I did.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(eagerly)</stage>I will! What is it?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Drown yourself!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(shouting again)</stage>Will you be quiet, sir ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Listen to me. Three years ago it was my misfortune to captivate the affections of a still
    blooming, though somewhat middleaged widow, at Ramsgate.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(aside)</stage>Singular enough! Just my case three months ago at Margate.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Well, sir, to escape her importunities, I came to the determination of enlisting into the
    Blues, or Life Guards.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(aside)</stage>So did I. How very odd !</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> But they wouldn't have me—they actually had the effrontery to say I was too short—</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(aside)</stage>And I wasn't tall enough !</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> So I was obliged to content myself with a marching regiment—I enlisted !</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(aside)</stage>So did I. Singular coincidence !</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> I'd no sooner done so, than I was sorry for it.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(aside)</stage>So was I. •</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> My infatuated widow offered to purchase my discharge, on condition that I'd lead her to the
    altar.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(aside)</stage>Just my case!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> I hesitated—at last I consented-</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(aside)</stage>I consented at once !</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Well, sir—the day fixed for the happy ceremony at length drew near—in fact, too near to be
    pleasant—so I suddenly discovered that I wasn't worthy to possess her, and I told her so — when,
    instead of being flattered by the compliment, she flew upon me like a tiger of the female
    gender—I rejoined—when suddenly something whizzed past me, within an inch of my ear, and
    shivered into a thousand fragments against the mantle- piece—it was the slop basin. I retaliated
    with a tea cup—we parted, and the next morning I was served with a notice of action for breach
    of promise.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Well, sir?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Well, sir, ruin stared me in the face—the action proceeded against me with gigantic strides—I
    took a desperate resolution— I left my home early one morning, with one suit of clothes on my
    back, and another tied up in a bundle, under my arm—I arrived on the cliffs—opened my
    bundle—deposited the suit of clothes on the very verge of the precipice—took one look down in
    the yawning gulph beneath me—and walked off in the opposite direction ! </p>
   </sp><pb n="12"/><sp>
   <speaker>Cox.</speaker>
   <p> Dear me! I think I begin to have some slight perception of your meaning. Ingenious creature!
    You disappeared—the suit of clothes were found-</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box.</speaker>
   <p>Exactly—and in one of the pockets of the coat, or the waistcoat, or the pantaloons—I forget
    which—there was also found a piece of paper, with these affecting farewell words:— "This is thy
    work, oh, Penelope Ann! "</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Penelope Ann ! <stage>(starts up, takes Box by the arm, and leads him slowly to front of
     stage)</stage>Penelope Ann ?</p>
   </sp><sp>

   <p> Penelope Ann!</p>
   </sp><sp>

   <p> At Margate?</p>
   </sp><sp>

   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> It must be she! And you, sir—you are Box—the lamented, long lost Box!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> I am!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> And I was about to marry the interesting creature you so cruelly deceived.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Ha! then you are Cox?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> I am!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> I heard of it. I congratulate you—I give you joy! And now, I think I'll go and take a stroll,
     <stage>(going)</stage></p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> No you don't ! <stage>(stopping him)</stage>I'll not lose sight of you till I've restored you
    to the arms of your intended.</p>

   <p> No, sir—yours!</p>

   <p> How can she be <emph>my</emph> intended, now that I'm drowned?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> You're no such thing, sir! and I prefer presenting you to Penelope Ann.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> I've no wish to be introduced to your intended.</p>
   </sp><sp>

   <p>
    <emph>My</emph> intended? How can that be, sir? You proposed to her first!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> What of that, sir? I came to an untimely end, and you popped the question afterwards.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Very well, sir!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Very well, sir!</p>

    impulse of my nature—I give her up to you.</p>

   <p> Pooh ! <stage>(snapping his fingers in Box's face)</stage>Box. An insult! to my very

   <p> Pistols for two ! </p>

   <p> Yes, Sir. <stage>(going)</stage></p>

   </sp><sp>

   <p> Stop ! You don't mean to say, thoughtless and imprudent woman, that you keep loaded fire arms

   <p>Oh, no—they're not loaded.</p>

   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> What's your opinion of duelling, sir ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> I think it's a barbarous practice, sir.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> So do I, sir. To be sure, I don't so much object to it when the pistols are not loaded.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> No: I dare say that <emph>does</emph> make some difference.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> And yet, sir—on the other hand—doesn't it strike you as rather a waste of time, for two
    people to keep firing pistols at one another, with nothing in 'em?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> No, sir—not more than any other harmless recreation.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Hark ye ! Why do you object to marry Penelope Ann ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Because, as I've observed already, I can't abide her. You'll be very happy with her.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Happy? Me? With the consciousness that I have deprived <emph>you</emph> of such a treasure ?
    No, no. Cox!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Don't think of me, Box—I shall be sufficiently rewarded by the knowledge of my Box's
    happiness.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Don't be absurd, sir!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Then don't you be ridiculous, sir.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> I won't have her!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> I have it! Suppose we draw lots for the lady—eh, Mr. Cox.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> That's fair enough, Mr. Box.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Or, what say you to dice ?</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> With all my heart! Dice by all means— <stage>(eagerly)</stage></p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p>
    <stage>(aside)</stage>That's lucky! Mrs. Bouncer's Nephew left a pair here yesterday. He
    sometimes persuades me to have a throw for a trifle, and as he always throws sixes, I suspect
    they are good ones. <stage>(goes to cupboard at r. and brings out dice box)</stage></p>

   <p>
    <stage>(aside)</stage>I've no objection at all to dice. I lost one pound, seventeen and
    sixpence, at last Barnet Races, to a very gentlemanly looking man, who had a most peculiar knack
    of throwing sixes— I suspected they were loaded, so I gave him another half-crown, and he gave
    me the dice. <stage>(takes dice out of his pocket —uses lucifer box as substitute for dice-box,

   <p> Of course!</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> For, between you and me, I'm rather partial to this house.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> So am I—I begin to feel quite at home in it.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> Everything so clean and comfortable—</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> And I'm sure the mistress of it, from what I have seen of her, is very anxious to please.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> So she is—and I vote, Box, that we stick by her.</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Box .</speaker>
   <p> Agreed ! There's my hand upon it—join but your's— agree that the house is big enough to hold
    us both, then Box——</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Cox .</speaker>
   <p> And Cox——</p>
   </sp><sp>
   <speaker>Both .</speaker>
   <p> Are satisfied !</p></sp>
