<head> REMARKS</head>
<head> “My Poll and my Partner Joe </head>
<p>NATIONALITY becomes a virtue when it springs from feelings inspired by the
land of our birth. “The man that don't like <hi>England</hi>," exclaimed honest
Jack Fuller, in the heat of parliamentary debate, <hi> "damn him, let him leave
it !"</hi></p>
<p> In turning over the page of history, we contemplate with enthusiasm the
martial prowess of our ancestors, who were called to defend not only their own
liberties, but those of mankind. Britain has maintained her proud supremacy
among nations through a long series of ages; trampled down stern oppression ,
that threatened , and (with her own glorious exception) had well nigh spread
abroad, universal anarchy; and crowned the august work by giving peace to the
world, and freedom to the slave.</p>
<p> Whatever brings to our recollection the triumphs of the past deserves our
gratitude; but when genius applies itself to the task, how truly it commands our
admiration! The deeds of heroes were the favourite theme of the poets of old,
and their noblest strains were devoted to immortalise patriotism and valour.</p>
<p> Blessings on the memory of the bard, “and palms eternal flourish round his
urn," who first struck his lyre to celebrate the wooden walls, , and the brave,
generous, Jack Tars of unconquered and unconquerable Old England ! If earth hide
him, light be the green turf on his breast; if ocean cover him, calm be the wave
on its surface! - May his spirit find rest where souls are blessed , and his
body be shrined in the holiest cave of the deep and silent sea!</p>
<p> Among the naval lyrics that roused and kept alive the ardent spirit of our
seamen is “My Poll and my Partner Joe." We remember when every manly heart beat
to this national melody; but other tastes (“the fruits of calm times and a long
peace" ) are come upon us ; we have little sympathy for past glories. “Ye
Mariners of England, ” and “Here, a sheer Hulk , lies poor Tom Bowling," are
lost in (“Most Forcible Feeble!”) “Oh, no, we never mention her, " and “I'd be a
Butterfly." .</p>
<p> “ My Poll and my Partner Joe, " once so sweetly vocal, is now in strumental
in filling many bright eyes with tears, and the manager's purse with money. This
English song has suggested to Mr. Haines a drama as truly English, and that
promises to rival it in popularity.</p>
<p> In Harry Hallyard we behold a British tar, bold as Mars, brawny as Hercules,
and comely as Adonis ; in Joe Tiller, his friend and partner in a trim-built
wherry, a lad with a soul equally fiery, but a body of less herculean
dimensions. If Harry' s <hi>prose</hi> is of greater unction, Joe' s
<hi>verse</hi> is more than a match for it; for Joe builds the lofty rhyme where
the sea-mew does its nest, mounted aloft on the top-mast head. Among the
sailor's many virtues, prudence and worldly wisdom are not generally the most
shining; yet Hal is an exception; for, though deeply enamoured of his pretty
Poll, he resolves not to marry until industry has put him in possession of some
ready coin ; and that golden wish being now realised, the nuptials are at <pb
n="8"/> hand. An unexpected appeal to his generosity introduces two very
opposite characters- Black Brandon, the captain of a slave-ship, and Sam, a
supreme oddity, a bailiff' s tail, timid, snuffling , and quaintly pragmatical;
with one eye blocked up, and the other set in garnets! Hal' s savings are
applied to rescue an ancient, broken-down mess. mate from the rude grasp of this
raggamuffin body-snatcher, and the wedding is about to be postponed , when Mary
Maybud, commonly called “ Pretty Poll of Putney," charmed with the generous
self-denial of her sailor, proffers him her hand, which is accepted with prompt
enthusiasm; and Watchful Waxend, a psalm- singing cobler and the Bishop of
Battersea, is deputed forthwith to solemnise the holy rites; a task of no small
difficulty to that devout prelate, seeing that his red nosed reverence is ever
on the reel with a crozier in one hand, and an ale-jug in the other. The jolly
young watermen and their lasses are assembled, the fiddles are going, and the
punch is getting pretty freely on board, when an ugly customer intrudes, es
corting a press- gang, who exercise without delay their detestable trade. Joe
claims protection as waterman to a fire-office, but for Harry there is no
retreating: the Phænix cannot restore him to his lady-bird, nor the Norwich
Union accelerate his own. For this good office he is indebted to his gruff
friend; butm 'tis useless to kick against the pricks, and every black bristle in
the beard of sable Brandon rises in retribution for an insult that Hal's just
indignation had offered to this savage trafficker in human flesh. The parting
between the distracted lovers; Harry's consignment of his pretty Poll to the
brotherly guardianship of his partner Joe; his adventures on board the
Polyphemus; the capture of a slave-ship; the liberation of the negroes; the
ludicrous recognition of the Battersea Bishop in the odour of sanctity, who
saves Hal's life by a well directed shot from a beer barrel; the storming and
blowing-up of the strong-hold of the slavers; negro gratitude; "tremendous
explosion;" and a fearful catalogue of etceteras that occupy an interval of four
years, are best described by the scenery, machinery, and performers of the
"Royal Surrey". — The sequel is mournful: Harry returns rich in fame and
fortune, accompanied by the soaking prelate, who in manners, costume, attitude
is so whimsically metamorphised into a sea monster, as to leave but few traces
of his former identity. Hal, in his long absence had been killed by the
newspapers; and Mary following the example of Southerne's heroine, Isabella,
marries Joe Tiller, and greets her first love on his return with the astounding
intelligence. — The surprise, sorrow and indignation of Harry Hallyard the
remorse, shame, and agony of the despairing f wife, were finely depicted by T.P.
Cooke and Miss Macarthy. The accidental death of Partner Joe at this sad crisis
terminates the tragic scene; he dies as he lived with honour but <hi>Honner</hi>
(too good an actor to be thus prematurely cut off dies not with him.</p>
<p>It is pleasant to behold an audience crammed to the roof expressing their
sympathy with the scene by silence and tears, and shouting their emulation of
fun and drollery with uproarious delight; — it is pleasant to behold our happy
countrymen, with their sweethearts and wives leaving the pandemoniums of treason
to their buffoon mendicants and enjoying a few hours of rational entertainment.
Who cares for <hi>Tom Duncombe</hi>, when he can see (a much better actor!) <hi>
Tom Cooke</hi>? — Or Partner <hi>Joe (of Middlesex!)</hi> when he can make merry
with the <hi>Bishop of Battersea</hi>? The Church in danger! By the rubicund
proboscis of the right reverend Hierach ! we would pull the caitiff by the nose
(as the devil's chaplain did Carlisle and Saint Dunstan did the devil!) who
should raise such a false alarm! The Bishop in his pulpit was hailed by a full
pit and <hi> both</hi> sees was <pb n="9"/> equally popular ! — a cobler-prelate
in leather-pontificalibus; a black muzzled Jack Tar in blue jacket and trousers,
with a portentous pig-tail, from which depended a holyday rosette of true blue!
Talk of cheap knowledge and penny politics! Here a man may be happy for hours
for sixpence aye, and (liberty and equality for ever!) <hi>look down</hi> upon
his master!</p>
<p> We are not in love with sentimentality (like virtue!) for itself alone. No
man likes mustard <hi>per se</hi>. In this drama our sympathies are awakened by
justice and humanity, and tis highly seasoned with a plentiful infusion of fun.
By virtue of the latter commodity, we are reconciled to Mr Sam Snatchem and
swallow with epicurean greediness his rich morsels of equivoque and pun. His
delicate appreciation of Poll's pretty foot ("'Tis not like a <hi>pickaxe</hi> —
as much behind as before!") redeemed his queer obliquity of vision and unique
breeches and top boots. This prime buffoon, in the person of Mr Asbury, was
<hi>sui generis</hi>. — The law of arrest loses its terrors in such a scarecrow
representative: were Sam to pop his head among his old acquaintances in the
house when the motion is discussed the bill would be lost!</p>
<p> Great praise is due to Mr T.P. Cooke, Miss Macarthy, and our pious friend
the bishop, Mr W. Smith. We were much amused with the nimble-tongued loquacity
of (Miss Martin) a west-end milliner and cher ami of the prelate's! The house
rang with her orthographical <hi>variations</hi> that would have puzzled
<hi>Walker</hi> and given old <hi>Tom Sheridan</hi> a fit of the cholic and
contributed some new readings to the excellent work now in progress of the
venerable <hi>father</hi> Sheridan Knowles.</p>
<p> Mr Haines has chosen a happy subject and treated it happily and Mr Davidge
by its adoption, deserves the unprecedented success that has attended its
production. Let the public be won by patriotic spectacles and we shall not have
cause to lament that our national character among the humbler orders of society
is degenerated into apathetic, not say brutal, indifference. Though <hi>now</hi>
dwelling in peace, the trumpet of war may ere long startle from our pleasant
dream of security and to whom shall we <hi>then</hi> look for protection? Not
the mischievous brawlers in high life and low— for base poltroons they are, and
timid as treacherous — but the brave spirits who have done us good service in
the hour of peril, and whose glorious example has inspired a succession of
youthful heroes to conquer or die for their country ! It is wise to infuse the
<hi>amor patriæ</hi> into popular amusements: national songs work wonders among
the million. In Little Russia, no sooner are postillions mounted for a journey,
than they begin hum a patriotic air which they often continue for hours without
intermission. The soldiers sing during a long and fatiguing march; the peasant
lightens his labour in the same manner; and in a still evening, the air vibrates
with the cheerful songs of surrounding villages.</p>
<p> Peace to the souls of the heroes whose bones lie mouldering in the
battle-field! On England's glory — now nerveless cold and (thanks to the
barking, foul-mouthed curs of democracy!) almost dead, — England's glory shall
the brave long-tried patriot inscribe "RESURGAM!" — for Wellington has not
conquered nor Nelson died in vain ! </p>

<p>I'm much obliged to you. Be so good as to say that I can turn my hand to

<p>So, so; here's a discovery for the Bishop of Battersea! as my Harry calls
Waxend. Oh, dear! I wish our marriage was over!—And yet, I'm sure, if Harry was
to ask me, I should put it off for another year. Harry's to row for another
wherry in a month. La! if he was to win that, as he did the last!—that might
alter affairs. Mr. and Mrs. Hallyard, with two boats of their own!—I'd have one,
with a white awning all fringed round, and a flag at the stern, for Richmond
parties,   and t'other for every-day work—Joe should row that. I like Joe,
because he's Harry's friend, and he's so good-natured and poetical, and because
he's so kind to me;—yes, he should row the every-day one, and my Harry should
sit like a king in the other; and then, when there happened to be no company, he
should just pull me and the little ones down to—La! what am I thinking of? We've
neither got the boat nor the little ones yet.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, the duty, for the performance of which we are assembled, though a
painful, is an imperative one. To preserve the necessary discipline, we are
compelled to reprimand a brave man for an act that confers honour on the British
flag; yet, while obliged to condemn, we shall applaud and honour in our hearts,
one of the best seamen that ever trod a plank—one of the most fearless spirits
that ever handled a cutlass: his very courage must be restricted with severity,
or his example and extraordinary success will banish subordination from the
fleet.</p>

<p>Right: I am proud of my crew, but brave men should never forget obedience to
their superiors. You have forgotten your duty; you have been promoted since you
came on board; <pb n="26"/> you are a petty officer, and Mr. Manly has ever been
your friend; yet you have proved yourself ungrateful.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1058_M6">
<speaker>Harry.</speaker>
<p>  Oh, your honour! don't say that—it cuts me to the soul! Do you think I can
ever forget that Mr. Manly did all that he could to get me my pretty Poll's
letter that was lying for me at Trieste, when we were up the Mediterranean? and
he would have got it, too, but sudden orders came for us to join the fleet in
the West Ingees.—My log wouldn't be worth keeping, if I hadn't got that in large
letters. And then your honour's been so kind to me since I've been aboard, that
you've almost made me forget the cruel law that took me from a young bride: so,
what with your goodness, and the ship (bless her!) being called the
Polly—Polyphemus, keeping me always in mind of somebody at home: I've begun to
be almost happy.—Ingratitude! May I spring a leak, and go down in the black sea
of contempt, if ever I take such a villanous cargo on board!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1058_M1">

<p>And yet, Hallyard, you have dared to disobey orders. Mr Manly, state your
charges against him.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1058_M2">
<speaker>Manly.</speaker>
<stage> (R.)</stage>
<p>I must first preface, that, in thus complaining of him, I am performing an
imperative duty, with which no private feeling dare to interfere. He will
respect me the more for a conscientious discharge of it, when I publicly avow
that he has twice saved my life.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1058_M6">
<speaker>Harry.</speaker>
<p>Oh, your honour! say no more of that. I'd have done it even for sulky Sam,
the cook's mate, though he is the most disagreeable swab in the whole crew.</p>

</sp>
<sp who="#L1058_M2">
<speaker>Manly.</speaker>
<p>After orders had been passed to lie close, (we, having in the night crept in,
and anchored under the enemy's guns), he secretly persuaded twelve of the crew
to a breach of discipline. They lowered themselves over the side into the ship's
boat, and, at the imminent hazard of the lives of all, and the destruction of
the commodore's plans, they attempted the cutting out of an armed store-ship,
loaded with ammunition and supplies.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1058_M6">
<speaker>Harry.</speaker>
<p>Avast there, your honour! There's a bit of an error in your charge. We did
cut her out, and brought her clear off, in spite of the fire of all their
batteries, and the bellowing and blazing of their flotilla to boot; and if your
honour only remembers the prisoners we brought in—there were just two to a
man—six-and-twenty Spaniards, and we without a scratch, excepting Georgy Gunnel,
who would be so venturesome as to fight six—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1058_M1">

<p>Still you were wrong.</p>
</sp>

own fault.</p>

</sp>
<sp who="#L1058_M6">
<speaker>Harry.</speaker>
<p>Aye, your honour, with respect be it spoken.—Don't you remember when you had
me on the quarter, to give me a little jobation, because, in the action of the
day before, I took the trouble to go and fetch the enemy's flag, to tie round
Mr.   Manly's wound—don't you remember that, as I was standing by, you pointed
out where the store-ship lay, and said it would be a glorious thing to
disappoint the enemy of all the powder and stores on board? Ah, I see your
honour recollects; and you said, too, it was an impossibility. Now comes my
fault. Says I, to myself, I don't think so; I knows about a dozen as would do
it, and, as our chaplain says, “damme!” if I don't try. And so I axed 'em, and
they said “yes;” and we tried it, and we did it; and that's all I can say about
it, your honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1058_M1">
<speaker>Oak.</speaker>
<p>Now, mark what might have been the consequences had you failed. We were in
the presence of an enemy of superior strength; the policy of the commodore was
to hem them with their heavy vessels in shore; day by day we had been creeping
on them, till, on the night in question, we had taken up a position, which with,
every advantage on our side, must have brought them to a battle. Now, as I
before observed, had you failed, our resources and position would have been
known, and the prospects of the war totally destroyed in consequence.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1058_M6">
<speaker>Harry.</speaker>
<p>But as it was, your honour, they thought the devil was among them, and,
standing at all hazards out to sea, dropped like pigeons into the commodore's
hands.—Your honour will admit that, although you punish the cause—</p>

my heart was broken; and, if I murmured, the lash was my only answer. Yet,

were sleeping, my knife was at your throat; but I thought of the words the good
white man said to me at my own home, when he taught us his religion, and I
conquered the temptation. Well, I served you faithfully; you again sought my

listening to Mary, as she reads my last letter about coming home; I can see the
tears standing in the wrinkles of her dear old cheeks; and I can hear Mary's
voice quivering a bit, as she comes to the part where I tell her that I love her
more than ever;—Joe, in the corner, with his pipe, fancying he's shaking hands
with his old friend, Harry, and puffing out the smoke to hide his quivering
lips;—I can see 'em all three, and the old wherry, and Sculler, picking
gooseberries in the garden, and the old clock behind the door, ticking louder as

without crying a little—they seemed so like her own dear bright old eyes!

agony)</stage> Stay—stay, Mary! you mustn't think in this way now; yet there can
be no crime   in loving the dead. I loved Harry living, and I can't do wrong in
loving his memory. I passed by the Hard, and I saw the wherry. Joe hasn't taken
out his name, for I could see it through the bit of crape he has nailed over it.
I looked and looked till I couldn't see boat or river; my head swam, and my
heart beat. I'm a silly—silly girl! I ought to have died with his mother; but I
feel I'm burning away. Ha! ha! I'm strong, but it won't last for ever; no—no!

gets our livelihood in the fashionable quarters, to be sure, is better off than
them as vegetates in the purloins of the Mansion House; but to me, a native of
the delightful city of Bullock-Smithy, it's all very condense and mistificatory.
So I took advantage of having to measure Mrs. Fubsey, the great maltster's wife,
(who lives within a short distance) for a new Parisian corset, to rustificate
for a day, or, rather, half a day; for I've got to take home Miss Jemima

<stage> (with sarcastic energy)</stage>
<p>Not to blame?—Oh, no! falsehood isn't a fault, treachery isn't a crime. I
have been five years away, but I have never for a moment forgotten her; I have
worn this lock of hair upon my heart day and night, in the battle, the storm,
and the calm, ever since, and her name, my old mother's, and his, have been
oftener on my lips than my prayers, and dearer to me than the life I ventured.
Well, <pb n="48"/> I come back; I—I—find her false—the friend I loved a villain
—and my poor mother cold and dead! And all through their treachery—no! oh,
no!—they are not to blame! I—I—Curse it! I wish the tears didn't come up in this
way—they are fire! Here, here, take my money—take my watch—take all!

<stage>—An Apartment, with a large opening, C. in flat, covered by a chequered
curtain, which, when withdrawn, shews a neatly furnished room, with a glass
door, C. standing open, discovering the garden, the river, and opposite
shore.</stage>
<stage>Enter Mary, in excessive agitation, C. from R., dragging a chair after
her, and holding an old newspaper in her hand—her manner is wild and hurried in
the extreme—she seats herself, C.</stage>

<sp who="#L1058_F13">

<p>I can't see, my eyes flash fire—I wish that I could cry! I did see it

I have seen him—I have heard him call me his Mary, and I have lived to know
myself another's! Oh! if I could but sink into his mother's grave, and he never
know—but he will know, and he will loathe me—he will curse me! Oh,—do not, do
not, Harry, curse me! no, no! the old woman begged it with tears in her dying
eyes—he won't believe me—I—would I could die at your feet, Harry, that you might

<stage> (gazing sorrowfully on her)</stage>
<p>There she lies in her pale beauty, like a moon-beam on the stilled waters of
the ocean! What a pity she should be as cold as the one and as fickle as the
other! All my world is on that little spot of earth! Oh! if she could conceive
how I love her! even her changing heart would weep for me; but she can't—no, no!
she knows nothing of the holy hopes and the sweet longings of   of a real
love—even now false to me—another's! My soul is pouring out of my eyes in
adoration! I will raise her off the ground, 'tis a coarse bed for so tender a
flower. <stage>(raising her)</stage> I cannot resist the impulse! she will not
know that I have stolen that which is now another's—'twill be the

<speaker>Mary</speaker>
<stage> (still kneeling to him)</stage>
<p>Would to heaven I had, Harry! How did I prove my love? though 'tis sin in me
to speak of it now. Two, three, four years elapsed, and no letters from you, but
I never doubted—I tried to prove my love for you by performing all the duties of
a daughter to your mother; still time went on; at last the news came that you
were killed— we saw it in the newspaper—Joe got the list from the
Admiralty—there we saw it again—I won't say how my heart was bleeding as I
watched your poor old mother dying with   the news—she and I wept together, and
prayed for the Peace; <pb n="50"/> I saw she was sinking too; she trembled to
leave me; for your sake she pointed to Joe as a protector—for your sake she
begged, and to let her die in peace, for your sake, Harry, I consented—I became
a wife, but I still loved, I still wept in secret, though duty made me silent.
Go! it is a broken heart now, and my hand is another's, but it is yours till the
grave—till—oh, pity! oh, pity and forgive! </p>

it is. <stage>(putting it on the table)</stage> And now—the old man there will
