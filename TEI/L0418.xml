<head>Bamboozling.</head>
<stage>SCENE.—An elegant Apartment in a country hotel—opening upon gardens,
tastefully arranged.</stage>
<stage>Enter Waiter, showing in Sir Marmaduke, R.H.</stage>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p> Oh, these are the gardens, are they, very well—that will do.
<stage> Exit Waiter, R. H.</stage> They look very pretty, really. I am a slave
to first impressions, and I can see that I shall like them. How odd! Here have I
been staying two whole days, and did not know of their existence. But then, I'm
a newly married man, and I have to attend to my newly married wife, and new
duties—and that will easily account for my ignorance upon such matters.
<stage>(bell rings, R.H.)</stage> How the bells ring in this house, to be sure!
Ah, well! since my marriage I have discovered they are not the only belles that
have confounded noisy clappers. I'm a slave to first impressions, and if I had
heard my wife's clapper before marriage, instead of after, I think it is very
likely she would never have been Lady Meadows.
<stage>                                        Exit, C.</stage>

<speaker>Doiley.</speaker>
<stage> (without, L. H. 1 E.)</stage>
<p>This way—this way my lady, if you please—take care of the step—this is the
door.</p>
<stage>Enter Doiley, L. H. showing in Emily.</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Is this the public room?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M5">
<speaker>Doiley.</speaker>
<p>Yes, my lady—opening, as you see, upon gardens, which I trust you will excuse
my saying, are delightful. But you will of course, prefer private apartments, my
lady?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Oh, certainly—but do not let me be detained long. I must have post horses as
soon as possible.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M5">
<speaker>Doiley.</speaker>
<p>You may rely upon me, my lady—I will now give orders for a sitting room to be
prepared for you, and then   arrange about the horses. In the meantime, madam,
you will not be intruded upon here.
<stage>                                        Exit L.H.</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>
<stage> (sits.)</stage> Heigho! I almost regret now that I consented so hastily
to this marriage with Frank. To my uncle, Sir Marmaduke Meadows, I look for
everything beyond the mere <pb n="4"/> pittance I now possess. Frank is
poor—nay, poorer than myself, and greatly do I fear that when my uncle finds I
have wedded his nephew, his only sister's only child—whom he has so long and so
pertinaciously discarded, that his wrath will overcome the love he has so long
professed for me. So much for family feuds. Poor Frank! much and dearly as I
love him, I cannot help fancying that it would have been better for us both, had
we never met. <stage>(looks at watch.)</stage> Gracious heaven! <stage>(starts
up.)</stage> Three o'clock, and I was to have joined Frank by two at the latest.
Why, the packet sails at five—and I have yet another stage to go. <stage>(rings
bell.)</stage> Yes, we must cross the water—land on the continent—and there
remain until the anger of our mutual uncle shall abate. If he sees us in the
first fit of his fury, we are disinherited, that's certain. Heavens! how
impatient Frank will be at my non-arrival. <stage>(rings bell.)</stage>
<stage>Enter Doiley with book, L.H.</stage> Now, sir, I am most impatient about
the horses. I am going to Havre to night, and shall, I fear, be too late for the
packet if detained. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M5">
<speaker>Doiley.</speaker>
<p>The horses will be ready, my lady, precisely in half an hour.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>   Half an hour?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M5">
<speaker>Doiley.</speaker>
<p>Am sorry to say you cannot possibly have them before.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Well, sir, but then—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M5">
<speaker>Doiley.</speaker>
<p> But then, my lady, you may depend on them. I beg pardon, madam, but I have
brought a list of the ladies and gentlemen at present staying here.
<stage>(giving her book.)</stage> Perhaps you will do me the honour of
permitting me to enter your name? </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p> Never mind that. <stage>(looks over book, carelessly.)</stage> It is very
unlikely that any one I know is stopping here. <stage>(aside.)</stage> Nor,
indeed, do I desire to see any person, until my uncle has decided what my fate,
and that of Frank is to be. Ah! what do I see? Sir Marmaduke Meadows here? </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M5">
<speaker>Doiley.</speaker>
<p>Yes, my lady, Sir Marmaduke has been staying here for several days past.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<stage> (aside.)</stage>
<p>Oh, heavens! how particularly unfortunate, to think that my uncle should be
staying here. The very person, to avoid whom, I am now about to quit England.
When I entered this house, I ran into the very lion's mouth.
<stage>                                        (partly aside.)</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M5">
<speaker>Doiley.</speaker>
<p>Oh dear, no—I beg your ladyship's pardon—when you ran into this house, you
ran not into the lion's mouth, but the “Bull's Head.”</p>
<pb n="5"/>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Psha! Shew me to my private room immediately— quick, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M5">
<speaker>Doiley.</speaker>
<p>   But, my lady, it is not quite ready yet.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Ready or not, I must go.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">

<stage> (without.)</stage>
<p>Thank you, thank you—that will do.</p>

<p>That is Sir Marmaduke, my lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p> I know it. <stage>(aside.)</stage> What shall I do? Come, come, lead me,
sir, directly to my chamber. <stage>(trying to hurry him off.)</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M5">
<speaker>Doiley.</speaker>
<p>Wouldn't you like to have a peep at the old gentleman, my lady?</p>

<p>How shall I avoid him?</p>

<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>Good day, ma'am—very fine morn—Why, bless me —is it—it is—it's my niece
Emily.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p> What must be, must be! <stage>(affects suddenly to see him.)</stage> Eh? oh,
dear—what do I see? Oh, my dear, dear, dearest uncle! <stage>(embraces
him.)</stage> How delighted I am to see you. <stage>(aside.)</stage> I wish you
were a thousand miles off! How unlucky! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p> Oho! Why, you little puss—prettier than ever, I declare. How pleased I am to
see you. <stage>(aside.)</stage> I wish she was at Jericho. <stage>(to
her.)</stage> I'm a victim to first impressions, and it's my belief you are
handsomer than ever. Give me a kiss.

<p> Oh, my charming niece! <stage>(aside.)</stage> Considering that she was to

<p>Matrimony is an awful thing.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>Very!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">

<p>It should be well considered before adopted.</p>

<p>I believe you.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">

<p>But when the heart is fairly entangled in love's web, we are warranted in
adopting it.</p>

<p>True.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>Oh, most certainly.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>   I am glad to hear that. Then, again, before we take so important a step,
we ought to consult those who are interested in our happiness.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<stage> (aside.)</stage>
<p>Can she suspect? True, true my girl. But there are cases wherein people are
justified in acting for themselves.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<stage> (aside.)</stage>
<p>Can he suspect? At least I am glad to hear him say so.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>
<stage> (aside.)</stage> I'll come to the point at once. The fact is, Emmy,
since I saw you last— <stage>(aside.)</stage> —now to screw up my courage. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p> Yes, uncle—and the fact is, since I saw you last— <stage>(aside.)</stage>
Now for determination! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>I've—I've got married!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>And so have I.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>The devil you have! I didn't expect that, though. Well, there Emmy, don't
blush—I don't blush, you see. It's what we must all come to.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>But, my dear uncle, are you really married?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>Why, yes, I believe I am. I'm booked—I may say, hooked, at last. The old
dowager, Mrs. Singley, did my business. I'm a victim to first impressions, and
the moment I saw her I liked her, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p> And so you married her to prove it? Well, my dear uncle, I believe the lady
you have married to be a very amiable woman, although her temper is a little
violent. <stage>(Sir Marmaduke groans.)</stage>   And I most heartily wish you
may be happy. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>

</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>Rely upon it, my dear niece, my marriage shall make no difference to your
pecuniary prospects—that shall be my care. Yet, stay—how came you to marry
without my consent?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Why I must own it was very wrong.</p>
<pb n="7"/>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>Wrong! indeed it was very, very wrong—unpardonable! </p>
<stage>(crosses to R.H.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Oh, no, no—not unpardonable, because you know well, my dear uncle, “there are
cases wherein people are justified in acting for themselves.”</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>Oh, you little baggage! Well, I suppose I must forgive you. And now let me
know <hi>whom</hi> you have married.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<stage> (aside.)</stage>
<p>How furious he would become if he knew that my bridegroon was his own
discarded nephew.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>Now, then, tell me his name. If I like the match, I'll give you the Belton
estate—If I don't, you shan't have a penny.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>But, my dear uncle, what qualities do you expect my husband to possess?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>Qualities, girl! Those that women never think of   looking for in a husband,
but which fathers, uncles, and guardians always do. As long as the fellow is
young, good looking, well made, light hearted and loving, the lady is tolerably
content. But I require rank, family, station, principle, respectability, and
wealth. Now, Emmy, has your husband these qualifications?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Why I should think—that is, I mean to say that— that—that—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>What the devil do you mean by all this stammering? “I mean
that—that—that”—Say yes or no. Is he of good family?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p> Oh dear yes, as good as yours. <stage>(aside.)</stage> Your own nephew. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>So far so good. What's his name?</p>
</sp>

<p>
<stage>(R.)</stage> I believe I did. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M2">
<speaker>Bam.</speaker>
<p>I'm sure of it. I recollect you said you had a particular aversion to the
name of Emily.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>Then I must say, that I am very far from being pleased with the remark. Emily
was her mother's name, and therefore ought to be respected.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M2">
<speaker>Bam.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(L.) </stage>Ahem! I mustn't be rash here! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>But, be that as it may, I must say it sounds very odd, to hear Emily called
Polly.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M2">
<speaker>Bam.</speaker>
<p>Don't it? But people who see much of the world, always see strange things.
Now for instance, the church at which we were married, is dedicated to St.
Basil, and there   once upon a time—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>St. Basil? why your wife Emily—I mean Polly, told me, you were married at St.
George's, Hanover Square.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M2">
<speaker>Bam.</speaker>
<p> And so we were. You may always credit what my <pb n="14"/> wife says. I
never knew her to tell a fib! <stage>(aside.)</stage> That was found out! But
the truth is—let me see, what is the truth? The truth is, we were first of all
married in France. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>In France? Well, I never heard of that before.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>No! I dare say not.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M2">
<speaker>Bam.</speaker>
<p>I'll be bound he didn't! Yes, sir, we were married in France—and upon our
return to this kingdom, the ceremony was repeated at the express request of my
wife Polly's father.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>Your wife Polly's father! Why he's been dead these seventeen years.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M2">
<speaker>Bam.</speaker>
<p>More—more—nearly eighteen—full seventeen and a half! but he directed in his
will that if his daughter married in a foreign land, the ceremony should be
repeated upon her return to England.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>Very prudent, indeed. I can assure you it is quite new to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M2">
<speaker>Bam.</speaker>
<p> New? <stage>(aside.)</stage> No doubt about that—new as imported. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>And now, respecting your wedding. My niece Emily—I mean, Polly—tells me it
was a stylish affair.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M2">
<speaker>Bam.</speaker>
<p>Oh, very—very stylish affair—especially the first—I mean the one in France.
Lots of the nobility was there—and   in fact, it was more than once rumoured
that the king himself would attend.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>The king of France?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M2">
<speaker>Bam.</speaker>
<p>No, the King of Otaheite. And then after the ceremony we bowled away—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<stage> (interrupting.)</stage>
<p>In a new travelling carriage.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M2">
<speaker>Bam.</speaker>
<p>As I was about to say, in a new travelling carriage—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Drawn by beautiful horses.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M2">
<speaker>Bam.</speaker>
<p>True—drawn by a pair of beautiful horses.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>A pair! Why, Emily—I mean, Polly—said four horses!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M2">
<speaker>Bam.</speaker>
<p> Four! Well, she was right as she always is—Polly is never wrong. When I said
a pair of horses, I meant a pair first, and another pair behind <hi>them</hi>.
Perhaps it would have been more correct had I said <hi>two</hi> pair of horses?
because here, a <hi>pair</hi> is understood to mean <hi>two</hi>; but in the
part of the country where I have been residing, a <hi>pair</hi> always means
four, two and two. <stage>(aside.)</stage> He seems surprised—talk about
something else. But the great beauty of the horses of which I am speaking, was
their colour—white—white as the driven snow. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>White! why Emily—I mean Polly—said they were black!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M2">
<speaker>Bam.</speaker>
<p> Black? did she say black? <stage>(aside.)</stage>
<stage>(aside.)</stage>
<hi>Then it wasn't a white lie.</hi> Then for once she was wrong. Yes, my wife
Polly <pb n="15"/> is decidedly wrong for once. The horses were white—white as  
milk. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>It's very strange she should have made such a mistake!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M2">
<speaker>Bam.</speaker>
<p>Very! very strange! and yet no—now I come to think of it, it is not strange
at all—I recollect the horses had particularly <hi>black eyes</hi>. Don't you
recollect remarking the exceeding blackness of the white horses' eyes?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_F8">
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>I think I do.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M2">
<speaker>Bam.</speaker>
<p>Oh! I remember it perfectly well. You see Polly has confounded the blackness
of the horses' eyes with the colour of their coats.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M1">
<speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
<p>I suppose that was it.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0418_M2">

<p>Can't be the possibility of a doubt about it. </p>

disagreeably. I'm a victim to first impressions, and I know I shall like him.
Hark ye, sir! I always said that if I liked my niece's husband, he should have
the family gold snuff box set with diamonds. I <hi>do </hi>like you, so pray

<p> And I cannot refuse my promise to that. Half an hour of such matrimony as
mine has been is quite sufficient to satisfy a moderate man like me for a
lifetime. And now, released from my troubles as a new married man—restored to
the good opinion of my friends and my sweetheart—all that remains to plead for
is—that without which all else is useless and unprofitable —favour and
forgiveness from kind friends, for myself, and— <stage>(pointing to
