     <head>scene I.—Exterior of the Briar's Farm (the whole stage.)—On the R. Farm House, beyond
      which are Barns with Gates.— On the L. is a fenced Garden, with small Gate.—At the back, the
      entrance to the Farm; in the distance is seen the open Country.— Time, sunrise. —A Rainbow in
      the horizon.—At the rising of the curtain the sound of the mail is heard, and the crack of a
      whip, which is broken by the notes of a Lark singing.</head>

      <p>Well, George was right, he said the thunderstorm last night would bring a lovely morning,
       and what can he more beautiful ? the air is fresh and pure, and the earth is brightened by
       the rising sun. This is a happy home; all are content, and labour seems delight.</p>

       told me of it, I was hard at work, I blubbers a bit, and then I sets to a whistling, and they
       called me an nat'ral pig, but I didn't mind 'em, for Aunt Margery left me in her will a
       matter of seven pound ten,— so I thought I was a made man, but I warn't.</p>

      <p>Yes, drat me! I wouldn't be content with fourpenny, but I must swill sixpenny ale,—I wore
       my Sunday clothes while money lasted, and I wore 'em out, I was mortal extravagant,— was a
       regular dash,—chaps won my money, and Becky laughed at me; so I opens my eyes, and I says to
       myself, " Mat," says I, " whoahy, it's time to stop," and sure enough it wur, for Margery's
       seven pound wur all gone, and I'd nought left but seven shilling, so I turns to work again,

      <p>Yes, Michael, it is the act of an honest man,—he has taken a step that reflects on him

      <p>In her paradise of sweets, as she terms it. Ever since Squire Middleton sent old Graft with
       the exotics from the Manor Grounds, early and late, her thought, her very heart, seems set

      <p>I'll tell thee, Sophy, for thou art prudent. I like not these gifts—these beauteous
       flowers, though they may adorn her little garden, may be the innocent means to corrupt a
       heart pure as the buds themselves. Fanny is young and childish, too prone to flattery, loves
       not her plain, her happy home, prizes not the smiles of her sister or her father.</p>

      <p>Dear father, I must not hear you say so ! Indeed, you wrong her! She is all heart—for I
       have witnessed when you chid and left her presence, she would cry bitterly, and would often
       say to me, " Sister, you are a happy girl, our father loves you, never scolds nor is angry
       with you; tell me your secret, I will strive to learn it ?</p>

      in the centre of the Stage is a rustic stile, supposed to be the communication from the high

      a narrow lane on each side—a bank half-breast high, so that the action may be seen on either
      side—the rays of the sun are strongly reflected on the meandering stream; on the opposite side
      is a gipsy-fire, the rays of which contrast with the set of the sun.</head>

       prompted me to desert it ? Father! stem, unrelenting father! thy misguided, wretched child
       gazes on the abode that shelters thee, and trembles, for she dares not return to that once
       happy dwelling ; she would die in its porch, and death would be bliss compared with thy harsh
       look, and the sound of thy voice teeming with curses! Oh, I have merited that curse, but I
       must not hear it from thy lips ! No, no, heaven in its mercy, will spare me that dreadful

       strange rustic, that all I have are well and happy.</p>

       they were happy: I saw you plainly in my vision, but your dark hair had not turned so silver
       white, the brightness of your eye had not faded; oh, let it speak to your heart, father, as
