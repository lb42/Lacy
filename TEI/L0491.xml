   <stage>Scene .—A Cell in a Police Station. Wooden bench, rude table, pitcher of water—door with
    grating over it, L. C.</stage>
   <stage> At the beginning of scene, Grey, a policeman, pushes in Black. from door in flat, L.
    C.</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>Here you are !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>Yes, I see I am. <stage>(sighing.)</stage> Oh, dear me! Waiter!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>Waiter ! Officer you mean—you're not at the public house. I say—<stage>(coming
     closer.)</stage> Who are you ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>Apollo Black—a respectable tradesman.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>Psha ! Don't come that here. What lay are you on?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>Lay !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>Yes; is it an old game, or are you on a fresh 'un ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>A fresh lay ? <stage>(Grey nods.)</stage> I don't understand you.</p>
    <p>I never heard the words " fresh lay," except in reference to eggs at breakfast.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>Ah, I see, you're a reg'lar old 'un. <stage>(giving him a dig in the ribs.)</stage> Come,
     tell me, you're on the slant, ain't you?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>On the slant!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>Oh, well, if you're going to keep close, I'm off. <stage>(going.</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>Waiter!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>Officer.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>Let me have a private cell. I don't wish to be lodged with other vagabonds—I mean with every
     vagabond. I wish to be alone—I require a deep solitude and a private cell.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>You can have one if you like to pay a bull for it.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>Pay a bull!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>What a chaffing chap you are ! Well, then, you can have one for five bob.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>Waiter!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>Officer.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>Are you conversant with geography?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>Can't say I am. <stage>(aside.)</stage> Is he a reg'lar prig, or only a hamateur ?</p>
    <pb n="4"/>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>Because if you were, you would know that on the vast continent of America, on the other side
     of the Atlantic—in Australia, on the other side of the Pacific—in Her Majesty's possessions in
     India—at the Cape of Good Hope—and in some of the Friendly and Marquesas Islands—even at remote
     New Zealand, they speak the English language.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>Well, what of that?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>Then, as an Indian chieftain would observe "Why will not my blue brother speak with the
     tongue of his tribe?"</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>Eh?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>What do you mean by "bob"—"bull?" I have heard of John Bull, and an excellent old comedy it
     is—but never of Bob Bull.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>Oh, I mean—if you want to be by yourself, you must pay five shillings.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>Five shillings! now I understand. There, <stage>(gives money.)</stage> now take me to a
     private cell.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(pocketing it.)</stage> Why, here you are.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>Here!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>Yes—this is a cell.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>I think it is—but there is no furniture.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>No more there isn't; but all it wants is a carpet and some chairs, and a table—and if you
     like to have them put in at your own expense, you are at liberty to do so.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>I dare say I am. Well, a night's soon passed.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(putting his lantern on table.)</stage> Do you want anything ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>No—yes—I—where's my snuff box—I've left it somewhere ; yes, bring me threepenn'orth of
     snuff.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>Very good! <stage>(ties a knot in his handkerchief.)</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>What's that for?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>So that I may recollect. Now give me sixpence.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>What for?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>Three penn'orth of snuff—threepenn'orth is always sixpence here.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>There. <stage>(gives money.)</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>All right—back in a minute. <stage>Exit door, L. C.</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>Giving sixpence for threepenn'orth of snuff is certainly paying through the nose. Well, here
     I am shut up in prison, like a dumb or incarcerated negro—a shut up Black. Me, in gaol!—me, a
     respectable tradesman! without a spot upon his reputation, and without snuff? Unlucky, was the
     hour, now a fortnight ago, when I took a chemist's and druggist's business. Having purchased
     the business, I naturally concluded that I was a chemist and druggist—so I set to work and
     compounded various medicines, among others an Eye-water. A patient came into my shop who was
     afflicted with opthalmia—
     <pb n="5"/>I recommended my Eye-water. He bought it, he applied it, and in three days he was
     completely cured of one eye altogether. The opthalmia had disappeared, and taken one of his
     eyes with it. He came to me, said my Eye-water was all my eye and Betty Martin. I told him that
     I had miscalculated, that I was out— and he interrupted me by saying that his eye was out. I
     repeated that I too was out—he insisted that his one eye was out too. I was immediately accused
     of practising medicine without being duly qualified—and here I am, remanded!—but why should I
     complain ? Galileo was not understood by his age. What will my wife think of my prolonged
     absence ? She's as jealous as— a woman ; now I feel every confidence in her, and therefore have
     placed a watch upon her every movement. Oh, if I only had my snuff box, it might inspire me
     with the thought of how to get out of this! I've read Monte Christo and Jack Sheppard —he got
     out of Newgate with no help but his own fingers and one nail. <stage>(feeling his
     pockets.)</stage> Have I a nail? No, nothing but a toothpick. <stage>(noise of locks, &amp;c.,
     outside.)</stage> Some one coming —let me conceal my crowbar.</p>
    <stage>Grey brings White on, L. C. D.</stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(C.)</stage> Here you are!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>White.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(R.)</stage> I see I am.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>Five shillings if you want to have a private cell.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>White.</speaker>
    <p>There you are. <stage>(gives money—aside.)</stage> Oh, love! love ! into how many more
     scrapes are you going to get me ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(aside to Grey.)</stage> Who is this?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>Oh, a pal of some sort or other—I think he's a manslaughter. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>But I paid five shillings to be alone. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>So did he.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>

    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(aside to him.)</stage> Oh, he's a first-rate hand—he's a cracksman, a garotter—a
     housebreaker.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>White.</speaker>
    <p>But I paid five shillings to be alone.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Grey.</speaker>
    <p>So did he.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>If I only had my snuff-box. Waiter!</p>

    <p>Oh, beg pardon—I quite forgot—all right—I'll tie a knot in my handkerchief.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>But there is one already.</p>
   </sp>

    <p>Whew ! thank Heaven he's gone ! The idea of my pretending to be a thief!—Lothario White! a
     respectable teacher of languages! who never in his life took anything—stop ! when I say I never
     took anything, I'm wrong, for this morning I took an omnibus—or I should say the omnibus took
     me—for I received a letter from a lady in this neighbourhood, saying she wanted to learn
     Italian. I had scarcely taken the omnibus for five minutes—or more correctly speaking, the
     omnibus had scarcely taken me five minutes, before I heard a sweet, melodious voice, that
     sounded like "the murmurs of lone fountains, that gush forth in the midst of roses," exclaim,
     "I haven't got my tuppence." I turned round—I looked at her—'twas Julia—my Julia, who hadn't
     got her tuppence. The conductor gave it her—my emotion was easier to be imagined than
     described—to meet with Julia, to whom I was once going to be married—but her stupid old father
     married her to somebody else—I say again to meet with Julia—to find her—my first love married,
     in an omnibus, and wanting her tuppence. She told me that she lived in the neighbourhood. She
     got out of the vehicle—so did I—she led me
     <pb n="8"/> to her house—we entered together—we closed the door— and for the second time that
     morning, I took a 'bus ; at that interesting and auspicious moment, whose bliss was of linked
     sweetness long drawn out! the door opened—a man appeared (Julia whispered me he was her
     husband's friend), he cried "Policeman, I have found that man in the house under suspicious
     circumstances—I give him in charge. Policeman advanced, seized me by the collar—and here I am
     in prison— but by the heavens above us I am as innocent <stage>(kneels
     melodramatically.)</stage>—of all but having taken an omnibus—without any felonious intent.
     Little did I think that omnibus would drive me to despair.</p>
    <stage> Grey opens door for Black, who enters.</stage>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>Ha, ha, ha! I say, I've found you out—I've read the police sheet—you're not a
     man-slaughterer—I'm glad of it—you're a respectable man—so am I.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>White.</speaker>
    <p>What then—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>I was pretending, for fear that you—don't you see ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>White.</speaker>
    <p>Oh, yes. <stage>(whispering.)</stage> Then what cause—</p>

    <p>You and I are one too many on this earth.</p>

    <p>Then leave it.</p>

    <p>If I only had something to distract my attention— a philosophic novel, or a cookery

    <p>Why, you haven't got the heart to sit down and sup, have you ? at all events, leave me my

   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>I'll cut the fowl in two, and I'll take one bottle of champagne—don't be afraid—I'll not
     attempt to take your half.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>

    <p>But you have attempted to take my half— my better half.</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Black.</speaker>
    <p>And you, too—but let me not think of it! There's your share—one leg, one wing, and half the
