    <head>From The Lyceum Playbill.</head>
    <p>"The dramatic form of composition, more than any other, demands completeness; and it is not
     with an idea of appending explanation to the picture he has endeavoured to paint, that the
     writer of the play now presented offers the following extract from an historical work. But in
     illustration of the state of society in the Isle of France, previously to its becoming a
     British possession, a few lines from Mr. Pridham's valuable and interesting history of
     <title>"England's Colonial Empire,"</title> may be acceptable, as justifying whatever use the dramatist has
     made of the recorded prejudices and antipathies of the various classes of residents in the
     Island:—</p>
    <p>"The Creole part of the population made themselves remarkable by the intrepidity they
     displayed on board the fleets of France, or by the efforts of individual enterprise."</p>
    <p>"But the European looked with disdain upon the Creole, who, in turn, regarded the former as
     an adventurer."</p>
    <p>"The Islanders were held in contempt by the poor noblesse of Mauritius, on account of their
     ignoble extraction."</p>
    <p>"It was remarked also, that towards the latter end of the century, the French inhabitants of
     Mauritius appeared neither independent in their circumstances, nor easy in their minds, though
     they affected dress and gaiety."</p>
    <p>"The condition of the Slave was that of the lowest and most abject degradation. Numbers of
     these unfortunates had European blood in their veins, being the offspring of
     <hi>liaisons</hi> between the Planters and their Slaves, but such a pedigree only increased
     their misfortune."</p>
    </div><div xml:id="L0012_01a" type="liminal"><p>The unqualified success of this drama, and the kindness with which it has been treated by the
     whole press, leave the writer nothing to add, except an expression
     <pb n="3"/> of his acknowledgments to the artists who have so admirably interpreted his ideas.
     He has so often had the pleasure of entrusting a drama to the energetic and intelligent
     management of the Lyceum Theatre, and of witnessing the most satisfactory result, that he has
     long ceased to have any "first-night" apprehensions, except in regard to his own share in a new
     production. But well as he had appreciated the intellectual power and artistic skill of the
     company, the author of <title>"The Creole"</title> had not been prepared for the complete and finished
     portrait which every performer in the cast contributed to the general effect of the first
     representation. Something is always allowed, upon such an occasion, for haste, for nervousness,
     for inexperience in the full bearing and proportion of character; but at the production of the
     following play no such allowance was needed. To use the words of the journal under the
     direction of the first dramatist of the day— "Never did a piece of the kind play more
     completely on the first night. The three acts went, not only swiftly, but with all their
     variety of involution, smoothly as a ballet."<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="1"> "Douglas
     Jerrold's Weekly Newspaper."</note></p>
    <p>It is not to any unusual number of rehearsals (there were, indeed, but six)
     that this completeness was attributable ; but to the indefatigable exertions of the actors, to
     all of whom the author begs to express his most sincere thanks, coupled with as sincere a
     regret that uncontradicted rumour assigns an early termination to the present prosperous
     management of the theatre. Where all was so admirable, it would be pleasant and easy to bear an
     appropriate tribute in each case; but this has been so ably done by the various gentlemen
     connected with the public Journals, that the author prefers leaving it in their hands. He
     cannot, however,
     <pb n="4"/>deny himself the gratification of saying how much he owes to Mrs. Keeley's exquisite
     personation of the fiery, reckless, kind-hearted Vivandière. The character is a difficult
     one—more difficult to a first-rate, than to an inferior performer—but its mixed impulses, and
     double audacities of habit and of heart, are all inimitably given by this accomplished
     artist.</p>
    <p>The author may add—but by no means as matter of boast—that Mrs. Keeley's request that he
     would write her a play, was made on the morning of Tuesday, March the 16th, at which time one
     scene only of "The Creole" had been written, and that on the evening of the following Saturday,
     the completed drama (which is entirely original) was in the theatre.</p>

      <p>Ah! you have noticed that, have you? Yes, true enough, we do see very little of him, and,
       considering that we are his oldest acquaintances on the island, and considering that I was
       his father's most intimate friend for years before Master Alphonse de Nyon was born, and
       considering that when he came to take possession of his estate a month ago I gave him all
       sorts of information and assistance, and considering that my house cannot be called a dull
       one, seeing that I
       <pb n="8"/>am a very pleasant, amiable, lively old man, and that you are not a very
       disagreeable young woman, I think the gallant lieutenant might pay us the compliment of
       spending a little more time in our society.</p>

     <sp who="#L0012_F11">
      <speaker>Virg.</speaker>
      <p>Well, papa, you must excuse him for the present. It is a new thing to have a fine estate
       left to one, and a month is not a very long time to devote to visiting all its corners. If it
       were mine –</p>

      <speaker>Dami.</speaker>
      <p>Never. For a day or two after he took possession all was well enough. But in the course of
       one of his rides he met with somebody—I don't know whom, mind, and, of course, I have no
       right to inquire—but he met with somebody, and since that meeting I find that he has
       neglected his estate altogether. He mounts his horse early in the morning, and goes away,
       nobody knows where, and comes back late in the evening, nobody knows why. I dare say he has
       discovered that our island produces something else beside sugar, rats, bats, lizards,
       monkeys, and boa constrictors. Perhaps he has found some pretty slave girl a little too
       pretty. These young men from Paris are easily caught, but such things don't last. Don't be
       alarmed for your prospects.</p>

      <p>I am very thankful for your kind designs for my happiness, but could I really suppose
       Alphonse de Nyon capable of debasing himself by such a liaison as you hint at, I would spurn

       I shall never be able to pay, and to raise which the sale of every atom of property I have in
       the world would be insufficient; and that he holds, among the rest of his father's papers,
       certain bonds and mortgages from me, which give him absolute power over my estate and my

     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0012_F11">

      <p>Who could remain in France, my dear Damiron? A human shambles, with fiends for the
       butchers ? I am no bigot. Born an aristocrat, I saw but too clearly the crimes of my order. I
       saw that we were dancing on the volcano. I saw millions ground down to hopeless misery that a
       few might madden through fevered revels, almost less to be envied than the squalid despair
       which they mocked. Then the volcano awoke, and hideous was the retribution. At first, it was
       justice— wild justice; but the doom of still wilder guilt. For myself, though my order was no
       more, my title abolished, I could not condemn the struggles of a nation, which, shattering
       her dungeons, and shivering her chains, bade man, the image of his Maker, stand erect in the
       presence of his brother clay. But when a people, frantic in its new found liberty, turned to
       vengeance—not upon its oppressors, who had fled from the storm—but upon the guiltless and the
       helpless, when I saw the grey hairs of age, the golden curls of the child, and the bright
       tresses of woman, mangled day after day by the accursed axes of a rabble, my very heart
       sickened, Damiron, and I left my country for ever. But I am a Frenchman still, and my arm and
       my sword are France's to the last.</p>

      <p>Oh, you must study his will. For example, fearing you might bring idle notions of the

      <p>By one of those simple accidents, almost too commonplace to tell. I was riding one morning
       on the verge of my own estate, when, seeing a smooth piece of turf extending down a forest
       avenue, I thoughtlessly gave my horse spur and rein, and dashed down the path at full speed.
       Halfway in the race, a white object, hitherto unseen, rose, and startled him. He swerved
       violently, and I, who was riding carelessly, was flung upon the turf, slightly stunned by the
       fall, but not hurt. When I recovered, I found the white object was the dress of a young lady,
       who was sedulously sprinkling me with water— and there is the whole story.</p>

      <p>Well, it's not pleasant to talk about, but you ought to be au fait at the history of the
       regiment. You see, one afternoon during the voyage, I was lying in a hammock they had hung
       for me on deck, that I might keep my eye upon the soldiers. I was mending my model of the
       guillotine here <stage>(shows a silver ornament)</stage>—what a fine thing the guillotine
       is!—and I was nursing a poor dear little baby that was born on board, when I saw the English

      <p>I shouted at the captain—the captain shouted at the first lieutenant—the first lieutenant

       short, everybody shouted at everybody.</p>

      <p>You be quiet—you shouted as much as anybody. Well, out came the telescopes, and we soon

      <speaker>Bellona.</speaker>
      <p>That was just it. We agreed that it would be treason to France to risk the loss of all our
       guns against such a miserable handful. So away we went. But the cruiser was alive, and in a
       few minutes we found that she, too, was crowding all sail to chase us. Away we flew, tearing
       through the blue water like a frightened sea monster, and flinging the spray aside till it
       fell like the roar of a cataract. But after us came the cruiser, swift, steady, and spiteful
       as a hawk, and it was easy to see that she was rapidly gaining upon us. On we raced, and
       raced. Presently came a flash, and a puff of white smoke, and then the roar of a gun, and a
       cannon ball went splashing along the water. " The next won't miss," said the Captain, and
       sure enough he was right. Another flash, and puff, and roar, and down came our maintop
       gallant mast upon deck, as if it had fallen from the clouds. " Oh ! my blessed babby," said
       I, " you'll be christened at Portsmouth and educated on beer."</p>

      <p>Yes; but however we escaped I don't know, for the cruiser kept on throwing us those

       manner, while she gained upon us so terribly that I could see clusters of half-naked
       brawny-looking men, with cutlasses in their hands, clinging to the shrouds and chains, and
       obviously intending to honour us with their particularly unwelcome presence on deck. So I ran
       down stairs, or what d'ye call it, put baby to bed, and got a blunderbuss.</p>

      <p>Yes; I wasn't going to Portsmouth, without fighting for it, I can tell you. While I was

       all of a sudden darkness came on—a sea fog swallowed us all up—and when it cleared away there
       was no cruiser to be seen, and so here we are. (Sings, and takes a step or two to the music,

       the clash of swords in the garden, and that M. Latour came out, as flushed and haughty as if
       he had just won a battle. Yet Alphonse is the best swordsman in the regiment, except that
       preternatural coxcomb, Hyacinthe St. Emilion, who swears he was born with a foil and mask.
