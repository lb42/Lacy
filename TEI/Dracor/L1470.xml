<p>Mr. J. H. AMHERST addresses this melo-dramatic effort to that Public who has
ever received his compositions with indulgence, and rewarded them with
liberality.</p>
<p>The Author acknowledges the great obligation he is under to Mr. W. Barrymore,
who undertook the whole arrangements of this piece, and industriously laboured
to complete manœuvres and stage situations which the Patrons of the Amphitheatre
pronounce without parallel.</p>
<p>Those who have not witnessed the wonderful precision with which the horses
and equestrian performers execute the multiplied and difficult evolutions of
modern warfare, ought to visit the Royal Amphitheatre, in order to behold the
greatest treat which London now presents – that able and highly respected
scientific Master, Mr. Davis, has conducted the equestrian department; and the
splendid talents of Mr. Ducrow (unquestionably the first horseman and equestrian
actor in Europe) are contributed to render this splendid spectacle completely
perfect.</p>

Prussia. Look upon this poor boy; the only one of seven whom with these very
eyes I saw in cold blood murdered by Napoleon’s troops. My sons. - lie still,

was hurried on by fiends of hell, not men with human hearts. You know - you must
have heard! - myself and husband bound together, were compelled to <hi>see</hi>
these fiendish deeds. Bredowski, my husband, wept, but I became a statue, and my
heart was turned to stone; I shed no drop of moisture; I shall never weep again.

<p> Forbear! numbers would but mar my aim - nay more; I would not have him owe

<speaker>Napoleon.</speaker>
<p> Gentlemen - Your conduct as patriots and soldiers will, I doubt not, always
obtain my approbation: this defensive war must on our parts be conducted on the
same great principle which has elevated France to the highest rank among the
nations. With soldiers so resolute, and generals so talented, great results may
be expected; recollect our former victories - recollect how proudly our eagles
have presumed to soar. He is with you who has always pointed out their
victorious flight; he will now share your toils, your marches, and your daring,
but most just defence of all a Frenchman holds most sacred - the unpolluted
liberty of his native country. - (<stage>Turns and marks his eagles.</stage>)
Soldiers, turn your eyes on those honourable ensigns of your country, noble
blood has earned them, and noble blood will yet preserve them. I see some faces
here who have ascended the Alps, who recollect <pb n="9"/>Gradisca, standard
upon standard taken, cannon, castles, generals, all subdued; and <hi>yet bravely
threatened</hi> - half Europe is array’d against us - good, be it so,
difficulties give way to enterprize and resolution. I will teach this
combination - I and my valiant Frenchmen know how to die, but not to compromise
the honour or the safety of our beloved France - Onwards march! -</p>

shoots the centinel, rushes out and snatches his cloak away, dragging him within
reach of Bredowski, who throws him down, noise is heard without of the first

<stage>Enter the Prussians, followed by a party of Black Brunswickers. The
generals Bulow and Josef cover the retreat of the Prussians, and being pressed
by two French horsemen suddenly turn and discharge their pistols, which take
effect on one man who falls with his foot in the stirrup, and is dragged off.
During this action, the general Bulow has called to his soldiery to secure the
bridge - they immediately form upon it, all leveling their pieces to the L. H.
as the Prussians and French horse enter from that quarter in close fight.
Observe every third Prussian on the bridge fires and reloads, by which a
dreadful discharge is kept up. Ney gallops at this moment in the centre of the
stage in front, and makes an action for the cannon to be brought, which is done,
and the devoted Prussians are fired on without mercy - part of the bridge gives
way, and four men are precipitated into the water, a boat assists them. The
French take advantage of this movement, and order their foot to advance, they do
so, and succeed in clearing the bridge. The Prussian horse gallop to their
assistance, but are closely pursued by the French, a dreadful contest on the
bridge, and continual skirmishing below.</stage>
<stage>Enter Blucher and his Aid de Camp, who appear to have galloped
mercilessly, they are closely followed by four Imperial Guards from the right,
and a body of French horse on the bridge, who all discharge their pistols at
once. Blücher’s horse rears and eventually falls wounded, and Blucher with him.
The Aid de Camp is attacked and fights off - general attack of horse and foot
till the contest becomes confined to the bridge. The Aid de Camp enters and
raises Blucher, who tears his hair, and seizes his pistols, which placing in his
Aid de Camp’s hand; he begs of him to put a period to his life, rather than let
him become a prisoner to France. The Aid de Camp raises the infirm old man, and
placing him on his own horse, hurries him away from the field.</stage>
<pb n="13"/>
<stage>A general contest on bridge and stage by horse and foot. The French are
disadvantaged, until an Officer of the Imperial Guards leaps from the bridge
with an eagle and colours, and endeavours to stem the defeat; he strikes a
Prussian soldier from his horse, but is shot, as he is expiring, he kisses his
colours and his cross of honor. Ney snatches the colors - uprears them, and
after a short but animated attack, the French become victorious, the cries of
“Vive l’ Empereur” rend the air, and to a triumphant picture the drop

the complete execution of my orders, we shall win this battle yet, the ardent

<stage>(The Duke rides off in the midst of the fire, followed by Sir Thomas
Picton. Enter a body of French infantry and cavalry, with shouts of “Vive
L’Empereur.” The Officer orders a regular fire to be kept upon the Highlanders
among the corn, who are rapidly thinn’d; at the same time a party of English
horse charge from the same side as the French entered, and endeavour to force
the wood by performing a circular movement. The French obtain possession of it
after a struggle, and from the most advantageous situations defend their
positions. The English are now much worsted from the advantageous position of
the enemy, and are retreating under a heavy fire, when the Black Brunswickers
advance in most gallant style. the Duke enters on horse, and receives his death
wound from the wood. He falls, his men gather round him, and all is confusion
until Sir Thomas Picton enters with assistance, they cover the retreat of the
Duke of Brunswick, who falls lifeless from his horse, and is borne away. The
fight is now spiritedly kept up by both parties. During this Scene now and then
a straggling peasant is seen to fly across - Molly Malony frequently assist the
wounded, and discharges fire arms at the enemy. Blucher and Prussians arrive
with artillery and play upon the wood. During the whole of this Scene, Blucher
is active to a degree, and the Prussians fight with a desperate resolution of
retrieving their former defeat. The French are beaten - their eagles taken - the
British and Prussian colours float triumphantly. - Tableau, &amp;c.</stage>

is Phedora’s gratitude; and though its colours soon may fade, its scent will
