<head> Prologue,</head>
<stage> Spoken by Time, as Chorus in front of the curtain. </stage>
<sp who="#L0406_M9">
<l>Kind ladies and gentlemen, ere we begin, </l>
<l>You'll allow me a word or two just to put in;</l>
<l>I am Time—not the Old Time, that all of you know, </l>
<l>With his scythe, and his hour-glass, hobbling and slow. </l>
<l>Times change—I'm the modern, the go-a-head fast Time— </l>
<l>We laugh at the old one, because he's a past Time.</l>
<l>I'm here as the Chorus. The fact is, this play</l>
<l>, As written by Shakspeare, won't do in our day.</l>
<l>There's so strange an admixture of periods historical,</l>
<l>An emp'ror of Russia, a pedlar, an oracle, </l>
<l>That now in this critical age each man wonders</l>
<l>The bard should make such chronological blunders. </l>
<l>Yet the reason is plain, for we're told that his rhymes, </l>
<l>He wrote not for one age, but for all sorts of times ; </l>
<l>They've called upon me as Time only can reconcile, </l>
<l>Time's contradictions, so in a few seconds I'll</l>
<l>Show how I've righted what Shakspeare left wrong;</l>
<l>And as I'm a chorus, I'll do it in song.</l>

<lg>
<l> Long time ago from Bohemia</l>
<l> Sailed the king—no, we're wrong about the quarter ; </l>
<l>For the king didn't come from Bohemia, </l>
<l>'Cause he couldn't come thence by wateR.</l>
<l> So we can't have that,</l>
<l>But we'll place him at</l>
<pb n="5"/>
<l> Bithynia—it's a name no shorter,</l>
<l> Nor longer than the other, so the lines come pat, </l>
<l>And prevent the poor old dramatist's slaughter.</l>
<l> Doodle dum, &amp;c.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l> I've the actors dressed, just as I thought best, </l>
<l>In Greek Robes, with the Phrygian bonnet;</l>
<l> It's a fine effect, and may be correct, </l>
<l>Since the bard says nothing upon it.</l>
<l> Though a pedlar to place,</l>
<l> Selling tapes and lace,</l>
<l> On the stage, in this dress, may be thought a </l>
<l>Mistake—not a bit, </l>
<l>He looks well in it,</l>
<l> So what matter for the dramatist's slaughter.</l>
<l> Doodle dum, &amp;c.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l> This period to match, in each single snatch</l>
<l> Of music to be sung, I've tried of</l>
<l> The oldest tunes to get, including that, as yet, </l>
<l>Unknown melody the old cow died of.</l>
<l> And that all might be</l>
<l> In antiquity,</l>
<l> Alike, I for my puns cry quarter,</l>
<l> For I've chosen, good folks,</l>
<l> The most ancient jokes,</l>
<l> For this worthy old dramatist's slaughter.</l>
