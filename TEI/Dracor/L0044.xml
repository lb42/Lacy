<head>Scene I .—The Summit Of A Scandinavian Mountain.</head>
<stage> Pinnacles of rock glittering with frost, and various colours in the
stone. The Gods of Scandinavia are all ranged at the back, as subsequently
mentioned, but at the rise of the curtain, clouds entirely conceal them. Lights
down. Voices of Spirit Of The Age, and of the Author, heard —Spirit laughingly
calling to him to come on, and he grumbling. </stage>

</sp>
<sp who="#L0044_M11">
<speaker>Aut.</speaker>
<l>Hang me if I know.</l>
<l>The "Arabian Knights" were used up long ago;</l>
<l>The Genii, Planche's genius makes his own, </l>
<l>Ere we can say (his name) "James Robinson." </l>
<note type="ed">James (not Jack) Robinson Planche wrote many fairy burlesques
between 1845 and 1852 but nothing called The Genii </note>
<l>Smith's hammer has been beating, as I'm told, </l>
<l>Alhambra's ore into good fairy gold. <note type="ed">This is probably nothing
to do with the Alhambra Theatre in Leicester Square, which did not open till
1854. Smith might be Albert or Arthur, but nothing about hammers. </note></l>
<l>Most of the Operas are atrocious stuff, </l>
<l>And the Bohemian Girl's eloped with Brough.</l>
<note type="ed">The Bohemian Girl, an opera composed by Balfe with lyrics by
Alfred Bunn dates from 1843. The brothers Brough mounted a parody called
<title>Arline; or, The Fortunes and Vicissitudes of a Bohemian Girl </title>
premiered at the Haymarket on 21/4/51</note>
<l>There's nothing left but the old track to follow, </l>
<l>With Jupiter, and Juno, and Apollo.</l>
<l>They'll do again, and every one confessses </l>
<l>The ladies look so well in classic dresses.</l>

<l>Drop your conventional inventions, do, </l>
<l>At least affect to give folks something new.</l>

<sp who="#L0044_M11">

<l>But there is nothing new, and as is writ</l>

<l>The Gods of Greece at once to exile sentence !</l>
<l>Have you no other heathenish acquaintance ?</l>

<l>Yes, with the Roman idols I'm at home.</l>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0044_F10">
<speaker>Spi.</speaker>
<l>No, England wants no Idol-farce from Rome.</l>
<l>If you need fables, surely history's mouth</l>

</sp>
<sp who="#L0044_M11">

<l>Well, stupid, well—but as I must get near a</l>

<l>The Era—yes, I know; I take it in!</l>
<l>It keeps a dog that tells what horse will win.</l>
<note type="ed">The Era was a British weekly paper, published from 1838 to 1939.
Originally a general newspaper, it became noted for its sports coverage, and
later for its theatrical content. </note>

<l>That will do.</l>
<l>These Danes, you see, in olden time, adored</l>
<l>Gods of their own—a wild, fierce, jolly horde,</l>
<l>Who drank, sang, quarrelled, bullied, laughed and flirted, </l>
<l>Much as Greek Gods were pleased to be diverted, </l>
<l>When to the invader we were forced to give in;</l>
<l>These gods were worshipped, in the Land we Live in.</l>
