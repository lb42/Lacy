    <stage type="setting">Scene First — Drawing Room of Mr. Trevor's house— the Grange—a lawn and part of the grounds are
      seen through the window, which opens upon a conservatory at back of stage—doors, R. and L. 2
      E.</stage>
    <stage>Mr. Trevor, seated, R. C., reading a newspaper aloud, and pronouncing many of
      the words incorrectly, and with hesitation.</stage>
    <sp who="#L0707_M1">
     <speaker>Trevor.</speaker>
     <p>“In brief, the magnificence of the late flower show at Upingham was without par-are-lel
      (parallel), whether we regard the exquisite specimens of hor-ti-cul-tu-ral science themselves,
      or the unrivalled display of fashion and a-<hi>ris</hi>-tocracy congregated from all quarters
      of the—vi-nis-i-ty (vicinity).” Ah, that's something like style; that's real elegant language,
      just to my taste! “Hor-ti-cul-tu-ral” is a capital word; so is “par-are-lel;” so is
      “vi-nis-i-ty;” I must make a note of 'em. <stage>(he takes out tablets—shouts of laughter are
      heard, R. U. E., from the grounds—he looks through window)</stage> What's that? Reuben and Amy
      again! Why, I declare he's letting her chase him up and down just as if he was a child like
      herself! He's as much a boy as when his poor father died and left him to my care.</p></sp>
    <stage>Reuben
      bursts in through the window, C. from R.—Amy following and catches him.</stage>
    <sp who="#L0707_F5">
     <speaker>Amy.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (laughing)</stage>Caught! caught! I'm out of breath, Reuben, I'm out of breath! My
      side aches so!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M2">
     <speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, lassie, I think that will do for one turn.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_F5">
     <speaker>Amy.</speaker>
     <p>Grandpapa, it wasn't fair; he let himself be caught just to please me.</p>
    </sp><pb n="4"/>
    <sp who="#L0707_M1">
     <speaker>Trevor.</speaker>
     <p>Reuben, I'm amazed! If any of the gentry in the <hi>vi-nis-i-ty</hi> had seen you!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M2">
     <speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
     <p>What then?—They would have seen me making fun for a dear little girl, who wanted a
      playmate.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M1">
     <speaker>Trevor.</speaker>
     <p>My good fellow, this will never do. I know   you've many good points. You've helped me to
      manage the farm, excellently. There's not an acre but what's made the most of, not a shed on
      the estate out of repair. But really you must give up these strange concentric habits.
      Remember, that my daughter Lilian, whom I sent to Madeira for her health, comes back to us
      next month.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M2">
     <speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
     <p>Ay, and well, thank heaven!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M1">
     <speaker>Trevor.</speaker>
     <p>That you're engaged to her, and that you'll soon be married.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M2">
     <speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
     <p>Do you think I'm likely to forget that, sir?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M1">
     <speaker>Trevor.</speaker>
     <p>Why hardly; as you've been betrothed since you were boy and girl together. Consider that
      though I was at first a small farmer, we're now rising people, entitled to move in a
      super-incumbent sphere. You must get rid of your shyness, go into company, learn how to
      converse, sir. Look at me! I never meet with a gentlemanly word in a newspaper or pamphlet,
      but I instantly make a note of it, and add it to my concatenation.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M2">
     <speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (cheerfully)</stage>Talk's not in my line, sir; I'm not glib at words.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M1">
     <speaker>Trevor.</speaker>
     <p>Don't say <hi>glib</hi>, there's a dear boy. You should follow gentlemanly sports—carry your
      rod and line, for instance.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M2">
     <speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
     <p>What! to cheat silly fishes out of their lives   with mock flies?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M1">
     <speaker>Trevor.</speaker>
     <p>Pooh! shoot, then!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M2">
     <speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
     <p>No; powder and shot have so much the best of a bird, there's no fair play in that.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M1">
     <speaker>Trevor.</speaker>
     <p>Well, you can hunt.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M2">
     <speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
     <p>Hunt! What, when poor Reynard hasn't a chance? for if he gets to cover one time, he's sure
      to be killed the next. Hunt! Why, if it was a tiger in a jungle, and I saw death in his
      glaring eyes; or if it was to stalk down a desert lion—I here, he there—a strong man against a
      strong beast—a life against a life—why, perhaps, <pb n="5"/>I might take to it. But to scour after a
      helpless brute, doomed before he starts—no, thank you, sir, there's no sport for me where
      there's no danger! <stage>(Amy steals up to Reuben, and places her hand in his)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M1">
     <speaker>Trevor.</speaker>
     <p>Well, you <hi>can</hi> talk when you've a mind; but it's very rough, very rough! You must
      really inform when you're married to Lilian. However, I must abscond now. Old Stocks wants me
      to take his son as groom, and I've promised him an
      auditory.<stage> He takes his hat, and goes out by
      window, C.</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_F5">
     <speaker>Amy.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (playfully imitating Trevor)</stage>Promised him an auditory.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M2">
     <speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
     <p>Stop, Amy! Never mimic your grandpapa, he was your mother's father.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_F5">
     <speaker>Amy.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (earnestly)</stage>I'm very sorry; forgive me.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M2">
     <speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, pet; but don't do it again. <stage>(kisses her)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_F5">
     <speaker>Amy.</speaker>
     <p>  Indeed I won't.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M2">
     <speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
     <p>That creeper's loose, Amy. <stage>(takes up a hammer)</stage> Just give me the list and the
      nails; we must have all tidy for aunt Lily. <stage>(he nails up a creeper by the entrance of
      conservatory)</stage> There, it's come down. I've broken it off. Clumsy fellow! What have such
      hands as mine to do with flowers?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_F5">
     <speaker>Amy.</speaker>
     <p>You're not clumsy, although, you choose to say so. Now, Reuben, shall I tell you what you
      always put me in mind of?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M2">
     <speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (laughing, and throwing himself into a chair)</stage>Why, a great furze-bush, that
      can touch nothing without tearing it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_F5">
     <speaker>Amy.</speaker>
     <p>You know better, sir. You're like the great elm-tree yonder; when I try to clasp its broad
      trunk, I say, “Elm-tree, how strong you are!—just like Reuben.” And when I look up at its
      green leaves, and see the sun come through them, not fierce, but soft and gentle, I say,
      “Elm-tree, how kind you are!”—that's like Reuben again.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M2">
     <speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense, chatterbox! <stage>(she jumps on his knee)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_F5">
     <speaker>Amy.</speaker>
     <p>Hush! It's of no use playing at hide-and-seek with me. I know who's gentle and good. I know
      who took the poor poacher-lad for a servant, and made him honest by kindness. I know who rode
      twenty miles <pb n="6"/>through a snow storm to get news of poor Lucy Thompson's   sailor boy. I know who
      has been brother and father to somebody who loves him as if he were
      both.<stage> (kisses him)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M2">
     <speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
     <p>Silence, prater! All that's rough about me is my own. <stage>(in an undertone as to
      himself)</stage> If there's anything better, it's the work of another.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_F5">
     <speaker>Amy.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (hearing him)</stage>And if she made you good, she ought to be pleased with her
      work. And so she will be. Oh, Reuben, to think of your being married! And yet, I can't tell
      why, it sometimes makes me a little sad—I know that's naughty. What joy to think that aunt
      Lilian's coming home—coming home well, though we thought she would die, like my own dear
      mother.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M2">
     <speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
     <p>Hush, hush, dear!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_F5">
     <speaker>Amy.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, if there could be a little window before your heart, that she could see through! For
      although she loves you so, still I should like her to know how very good you've grown since
      she went. Oh, if you would only talk to people, that they might know what you really are!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M2">
     <speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
     <p>They won't know by my talking, then. I leave fine speeches to folks who write plays and
      stories, and such like trash.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_F5">
     <speaker>Amy.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (drawing from his coat pocket a rather worn volume)</stage>And so, sir, you hide
      your trash there! How often have I caught you reading it? It's the very story aunt Lilian used
      to tell me. I never quite liked it, though. The people were so naughty to each other at last,
      though   they'd been little man and wife from children, just like you and aunt Lilian. O, see!
      here's the postman coming up the walk. Let me run and see what he's got.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_M2">
     <speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
     <p>Off she goes, then. <stage>(he kisses her—Amy runs out, C. to, L.—he takes up book, and
      gazes on title page)</stage> “Lilian Trevor!”—Her own dear name, written by herself —so light,
      so delicate, it seems like looking at her. I wonder at times that she could ever love a
      coarse, awkward fellow like me. I suppose it was being used to me. We lived in this house
      together when we wore pinafores. To think that next month she'll be here!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0707_F5">
     <speaker>Amy.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (bursting into the room, L. C. door, with a letter)</stage>It's for you; guess from
      whom. It ought to have been <pb n="7"/>here before. See, it's marked “too late!” <stage>(Reuben takes the
      letter, and remains looking at the address)</stage></p>

    <sp who="#L0707_F5">
     <speaker>Amy.</speaker>

    <sp who="#L0707_M2">
     <speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
     <p>From <hi>her!</hi> why, she ought now to be at sea. If it should be to say that she's not
      coming—that she's again ill! <stage>(he compares the direction with the handwriting in the
      book)</stage> See how trembling the handwriting looks beside this. She is ill! <stage>(he
      opens the letter with an effort, and reads)</stage>—“Southampton, Tuesday.“My very dear
      Reuben,—This date will surprise you; I myself can hardly believe that I am once more in
      England. I met with an unlooked-for chance of leaving Madeira; and I know that neither my dear
      father, yourself, nor my little Amy will be sorry to see me   sooner than you expected.“I am a
      little tired with my journey; but do not suppose I am ill. To-morrow I take the rail home, and
      shall be with you by noon. Bless you all.“Your ever affectionate Lilian Trevor.”What can it
      mean? “Southampton, Tuesday!”—the words ring like bells in my ears; but I can't catch the
      sense. <stage>(glancing again over the letter)</stage> “Southampton— Tuesday—an unlooked-for
      chance of leaving Madeira— the rail home—be with you by noon!” <stage>(he stands silent; then
      turns suddenly, and catches Amy's arm)</stage> This is you, Amy?</p>

     <p>That's right. I ask; you answer. There's the hammer on the floor, and the list I was nailing

     <p>You're all very kind to me. I shall think of you often when I'm far away. For I go to a land
      that asks for a man's pith and sinew; where there are broad forests to be cleared, wide
      prairies to roam.</p>

      I didn't guess till now the hold she had on me. Leave her? Heaven, that denies me a wife's
      love, has perhaps given me its next blessing in the pure love of a child. It's a hard
      struggle; but with a clear conscience and her dear help, I shall get through—I shall get
      through. <stage>(cheerfully)</stage> Yes, Amy; I stay for <hi>thee!</hi> <stage>(he sinks into
      a chair, and embraces her fondly)</stage></p></sp>
