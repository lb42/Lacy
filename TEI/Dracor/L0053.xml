<div type="scene">

<stage type="setting">SCENE — An Apartment in “Bee-Hive Lodge”—The window looks
upon a garden. —Doors R. and L.—Pianoforte R.H.—Large couch, tables, chairs,
&amp;c.</stage>
<stage>Enter Eliza, L.H.</stage>
<sp who="#L0053_F6">
<speaker>Eliza.</speaker>
<p>I wonder whether master and his friend did come last night, after all! They
were to leave London by the ten o'clock train, and to arrive here at four in the
morning. And the door was to be left on the latch, and the double-bedded room
was to be got ready, so Missis might not be disturbed by her husband's return.
There never was such a man—so considerate, and so kind to Missis and the poor
servants! <stage>(goes to door R.)</stage> Yes, they must be there— how somebody
snores! <stage>(comes back.)</stage> I hope it's not Miss Margaret's intended. I
couldn't abide a snoring husband. Ah! here is Missis and Miss Margaret. </p>
<stage>(pretends to be dusting.)</stage>
<stage>Enter Mrs. Honeyball and Margaret, L.H.</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
<p>Never mind the room, just now, Eliza, but go and see about breakfast for the
gentlemen—they will be getting up soon, I suppose.</p>
<stage> Exit Eliza, D.L.H.</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>If Mr. Swoppington had any gallantry, Kate, he would have been up long ago.
Considering that he has never seen me, I think his persevering sleep rather a
bad compliment.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
<p>You mean, Miss Margaret, that you are in a violent hurry to see him.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>Well, you'll allow that the wish is natural, won't you?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
<p>Oh! certainly; though, as you have agreed to marry him, his personal
appearance is of no particular consequence, you know.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>I know no such thing, then; and though I have agreed to marry him, and if he
had been my brother's friend for twenty   thousand years, instead of twenty, I
won't have him, if I don't like him.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
<p>Oh! nonsense. As he has proposed for you on the <pb n="4"/> strength of the
character Paul gave you, of course you can't shew less confidence in your
brother.</p>

</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>I wish Paul would mind his own business, and not go running about finding
husbands for me. This is the ninth he has offered me, within two months.
However, <stage>(laughing)</stage> I know he means it kindly, so I won't
complain. But, Kate, it's perfectly ridiculous <stage>(looking at door
R.H.)</stage> for two men to go on sleeping like this!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
<stage> (laughing)</stage>
<p>Keeping a young lady waiting for her intended.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>I wonder what he is like?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
<p>Paul says he is very good looking.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>Yes, and illustrates his notion of beauty, by adding that they resemble one
another. Now, if Mr. Swoppington is such a guy as Paul—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, I won't hear Paul abused! He may not be strictly handsome—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>No, he is not.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
<p>But he is a very good sort of husband!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>Yes, but he snores; I can hear him at this distance.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
<p>Perhaps, now, it is Mr. Swoppington!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>No, don't say that, the thing's impossible! But I won't bear this any longer.
Will you knock at the door, and make them   get up?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
<p>Not I; let them sleep, poor things!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>Shall they? Not if I know it! <stage>(goes to the pianoforte— makes a long
run over the keys)</stage> Do you think they heard that? Stop, I'll play them
something that would wake the Seven Sleepers! <stage>(plays very loud indeed -
as she concludes, the door, R.H., opens, and Honeyball enters, and closes the
door after him.</stage> My dear Paul!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>My dear Kate! <stage>(kisses her)</stage> And how are you? I am so happy to
see you! The four weeks and three days I have been away, have really seemed
quite a month—they have, upon my honour! Margaret, dear, how d'ye do?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>Oh, very well, Paul! but where's—where's—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>Exactly—out with it, Meg!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>Where's my—where's Mr. Swoppington?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Swoppington is at present in bed, where I beg you will allow him to
remain, inasmuch as he has had only two hours sleep, poor fellow!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>Ah! he has been restless. He has been thinking of me, of course, and that
kept him awake.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>To use a strong expression—not exactly. For though love, and curiosity, and
such like follies, may disturb one's repose, they don't make one turn other
people out of bed, <pb n="5"/> quarrel for the softest pillow, and otherwise
discompose other people's dormitory arrangements.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>   I mean my valued friend, Swoppington—now, I am happy to say, asleep—has
one fault—exactly one!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
<p>Why, you wrote us word that he was faultless!</p>

</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>Because he had not then rendered me sleepless. But as last night he would not
allow me to close my eyes, they were naturally open to his failing.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>And pray what is it?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>Simply this:—He is never satisfied with anything of his own, but always wants
everything that belongs to other people.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>Pleasant!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>Remarkably! The failing, if indulged in too much, might bring it's possessor
under the unfavourable notice of a dozen of his countrymen. But Swoppington does
not go to such extremes. He only asks for everything he sees, and despises it
from the moment it is his. I hope your married life will be happy,
notwithstanding—very happy!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>The prospect is not inviting.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>Yes; for though he spoiled my night's rest—although he insisted upon it, that
I had the best of the two beds, and when we had changed, he grew tired of his,
and made me change back again. Although, when the bed question was settled, he
opened a debate upon the pillows; contending, first, that his was too hard, and
afterwards, that its substitute was too soft; he would have the cloak I threw
over my feet, instead of his own railway wrapper, and then found that the cloak
was not warm enough, and that he   wanted his wrapper again. In spite of all
this, I am bound to recommend him as a husband, seeing that he is well off,
good-natured, intelligent, and, in short, almost as desirable a partner
as—myself.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
<stage> (laughing)</stage>
<p>A sad anti-climax, Paul, dear!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>Madam, or rather Mrs. Honeyball, you don't appreciate the wonderful good
fortune which gave you such a man as myself. Margaret, you will, I hope, be more
grateful for fewer advantages.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>But, Paul, it seems to me that this young gentleman's changeable nature may
induce him to think that a girl who has accepted him, is no longer worth his
attention, and poor Margaret Honeyball may share the affecting fate of the beds
and pillows.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>I think it extremely probable.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>You do?</p>
</sp>
<pb n="6"/>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, I may say, I think it certain.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>Then why did you bring him here?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>To marry you.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>And now you think he will refuse.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>I think nothing of the kind.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>I wish you would explain yourself.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<stage> (triumphantly)</stage>
<p>See, now, what it is to have a man of intellect at the head of a
household.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
<stage> (laughing)</stage>
<p>But give us a proof that our household is so favoured.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>Envenomed sarcasm! never mind, young woman, listen —we must plot.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
<p>   Plot?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>I said “plot,” and if it will be any satisfaction to you, I will say it
again.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<stage> (poutingly)</stage>
<p>As for me, I can only say, that if I cannot have a husband without plotting
to gain one, I'll die an old maid.</p>
<pb ed="x" n="6"/>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>Don't use such horrible expressions.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, I don't know what you are always fidgetting about my marriage
for.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>Peg Honeyball, hearken! You are twenty years of age —Mr. Swoppington is an
excellent young man, with a trifling, but ludicrous failing. If you like to give
him up, say so, and he shall go back to town by the mid-day train.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>No, no! that would be inhospitable—and—well, what is it you propose?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>Ha! come to your senses, eh? Exactly. Now I'll tell you Swoppington is my
very old friend—good. I went to town, as you know, on our election petition, and
one evening, not exactly knowing what to do with myself—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
<p>And not caring enough for your wife, to sit down and write her a letter—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>My love—the post had gone out, so I looked in at a Casino.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
<p>What's that?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>Oh, one of those places which the “early closing” agitation has induced
Philanthropists to open for the moral improvement   of young Holborn. There I
met Swoppington, improving his morals <stage>(aside)</stage> and his Mazourka
polka. <stage>(aloud)</stage> We supped together, and I took occasion to tell
him that you were being courted by our neighbour Jeremy Census, Assistant
Registrar of births, marriages, and deaths. He caught fire at the idea,
threatened to add Jeremy's name to his list of deaths, if he did not discontinue
his addresses—and proposed for you himself.</p>
</sp>
<pb n="7"/>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>Which he would not have done, but for having a rival.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>Perhaps—and when he loves you on his own account he will be glad that I
invented the story. See what it is to have a man of intellect for a brother!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
<p>And he insisted on accompanying you here?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>He would hear of no delay—he would have taken an express engine, instead of
awaiting the regular train, if I had allowed it—and here he is.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>Asleep. But, at all events, he is an original.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>I hear him getting up—<stage>(going to door)</stage> hush—yes!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>At last—now you can present him.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>Not a bit—you forget my plot.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>Explain it, then, and make haste.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>Now you two go into the garden, and I will come to you. I don't want him to
see you.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F5">
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>Not see us?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>No, not yet! Now go—and trust to me, a man of intellect. Do you hear?
Away!</p>
<stage>Exeunt, hastily, Margaret and Mrs. Honeyball, through C.</stage>
<stage>Enter Swoppington, R.H.D.</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<stage>(L.H.)</stage>
<p>   Up at last, Swoppington! I think you have had a pretty good spell, eh?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M2">
<speaker>Swop.</speaker>
<p>Come—I like that—I do, upon my honour. You who <pb ed="x" n="7"/> made one
long splendid sleep, while I did nothing but toss about, and twist about like a
porpoise with something on his mind. I'd give anything to sleep like you. You
too, who had the best bed, and the softest, and the warmest—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>Well, you chose your bed.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M2">
<speaker>Swop.</speaker>
<p>I know I did, and I chose wrong, as I always do in everything. Come what
will, I am always worse off than anybody else. But where are the ladies?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>Gone out, hours ago—gone for a walk in the woods. Why, you don't suppose we
keep London hours here and feel that if we're obliged to breakfast at noon, we
have been called up in the middle of the night! <stage>(takes out his
watch)</stage> It's nearly—it's nearly—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M2">
<speaker>Swop.</speaker>
<stage> (runs to him)</stage>
<p>I say! where did you get that watch?—what a nice watch—a capital watch! where
did you get it?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>Get it? I got it at a watchmaker's—Dent's, I believe.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M2">
<speaker>Swop.</speaker>
<p>I don't believe you did. It's a beauty—a love—the captain of watches—does it
go well?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>Loses rather.</p>
</sp>
<pb n="8"/>
<sp who="#L0053_M2">
<speaker>Swop.</speaker>
<p>Now, that's just what I like, too; I like a watch that loses —one don't seem
to get old so fast. Swop with me for mine, will you?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>No! I rather like this—I prefer keeping it.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M2">
<speaker>Swop.</speaker>
<p>Well, lend it me, then, for a bit; come, I'll lend you anything of mine you
like. I'll lend you my umbrella.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>I've got half-a-dozen umbrellas.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M2">
<speaker>Swop.</speaker>
<p>How you must steal! but I'll have a watch like that, in spite of you, see if
I don't. I'll buy one, instead of this beast of a thing. <stage>(takes out
his)</stage> Here's a regular old warming-pan for you, isn't it?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>No, a devilish fine repeater!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M2">

<lg>
<l>Love knows no sleep!—the silent Hours </l>
<l>   That fold his roses, light his star, </l>
<l>And chain, with links of dew-bright flowers, </l>
<l>   The steeds that roll his golden car. </l>
<l>When parted lovers distant lie </l>
<l>   In midnight slumbers pure and deep, </l>
<l>Who guides the dream, who wakes the sigh, </l>
<l>   But watchful Love?—Love knows no sleep! </l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Love knows no sleep!—his pulses play </l>
<l>   When wilder passions sink to rest, </l>
<l>As, when the storm has passed away, </l>
<l>   The sea-bird clings to Ocean's breast. </l>
<l>When wearied Hopes with day expire, </l>
<l>   When throbs not Joy, nor Sorrows weep, </l>
<l>Love guards unquench'd his altar-fire, </l>
<l>   A beacon true—Love knows no sleep!</l>

<p>—You did not know me then in those days; that, you will say, makes a
difference. But you might have known me—a small voice might have whispered
“Swoppington,” and you might have   waited until you did know me. I waited, you

<p>No matter, madam, I forgive you—I will not reproach you—your own heart must
reproach you, to say nothing of your husband, who of course renders your life
one long misery. Don't tell me he does not, because I know he does—I happen to
know he does. But he shall not ill-treat you longer, madam, no, I will protect
you from his ferocity. I have read Alexander Dumas, Madam, Eugene Sue, George
Sand—and I know my course. I will call him out, madam! I am a dead shot! I will
displace him—destroy him—remove him —shoot him, in fact!—you will be a widow—I
will marry you, and we'll go together in a cab to the Norwood Cemetery, and weep
over his grave!</p>

<p>Yes. Did you ever read Homer, Mrs. Honeyball? If you have, you will remember
that Helen was carried off from Menelaus by Paris. Very good—I'm Paris, you're

<p>You think so. <stage>(aside)</stage> Now for a thumper.

<p>Yes, we met at Ramsgate, two years ago; we flirted on the Pier, raffled in
the libraries, danced at Tivoli, and sat upon the <pb ed="x" n="18"/>   beach to
look at the bathing machines. I always used to pay for her chairs. We parted—we
are now re-united for ever.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M1">
<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<stage> (wildly)</stage>
<p>And this is my wife, upon whom I believed I had made the first impression!
Raffled at Ramsgate, and I have married such a woman!</p>

<p>Mr. Census, he's here; master sent to him to come, and I was to tell you,

<p>Now, Mr. Honeyball; you sent for me to arrange for a marriage. You must come
to my office, and if you'll give me the names I'll get everything ready. Hollo!
where are they?—I had them, just this moment.</p>

<sp who="#L0053_M2">

<p>Oh, you needn't be in such a hurry, you've nearly pulled my nose off—I don't

<p>Now, Mr. Honeyball!</p>
</sp>
<stage> Honeyball stands by, and tells him what to write. Meantime, Swoppington
goes up and inspects the stick, and takes it up. The head falls off—business of
regaining the stick, then the head - finally Census obtains them.</stage>

<speaker>Honey.</speaker>
<p>All right!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M3">

</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M3">

<p>Confound you, what do you mean by calling me a   blunderer? Once for all,
does Miss Honeyball mean to sign or not?</p>

<p>What—again—what? <stage>(Margaret signs)</stage> Am I to believe my eyes? She
goes—she dips—she signs—let's see, “Margaret Honeyball!”—it's she—it's you—it's

<p>Hallo! he's going it again. Are you satisfied?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M2">
<speaker>Swop.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I am perfectly satisfied, for the first time in my life. Satisfied with
what has fallen to my lot, and my dear little wife, here, will confirm me, I
hope, in my good intentions for the future, for I give her due notice, it will
be her fault, and not mine, if I ever wish for a change again.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_F6">
<speaker>Eliza.</speaker>
<p>If you should, sir, I should be happy to come to you— for double my present

</sp>
<sp who="#L0053_M2">
<speaker>Swop.</speaker>
<p>Still, I must say, I hope for the sake of the author of the little plot we
have just unravelled, that it will be the opinion of all present, that for once,
at least, “Anything for a Change” has proved better than no change at all.</p>
