<performance>
<p>First performed at the Pavilion Theatre, May, 1838— at the Royal Surrey
Theatre, on Monday, November 19th, 1838.</p>
</performance>
<div type="liminal">
<head>Copy of the Surrey Bill.</head>
<p>The Stage is never devoted to a more noble or better purpose than when it
lends its powerful aid to improve the morals, and correct the vices of the age.
It is this conviction which has led to the adaptation of the impressive Work
upon which this Drama is founded, opening one of the darkest volumes of life,
and revealing facts that must startle the more strongly, from the previous total
ignorance of their existence, even by those persons residing in the very heart
of the scenes in which they are daily and nightly passing. Nothing can be more
useful and salutary than the knowledge of such facts to the Public at large,
against whom the offences of which they consist are practised, and the
consciousness of their possessing such knowledge by the individuals themselves
employed in the commission of them. " Holding the mirror up to nature," albeit
in its worst light, and showing the manner in which youth is unsuspectedly
seduced into crime—unmasking the nurseries of guilt—pointing out the receptacles
of plunder—and warning the victims both sinned against and sinning; the object,
as <hi>The Times </hi> newspaper of Tuesday, November 13th, 1838, in an able and
eloquent article on this important subject, justly remarks, is " not for the
purpose of grounding any legislative remedy against these particular nuisances,
but for the sake of giving to the respectable inhabitants of every parish a
general acquaintance with what goes on in the little alleys near them, and thus
enabling them to exercise with the more advantage that local vigilance, which is
the best, and, indeed, almost the only check upon these haunts of vice. Evidence
of complete offences committed by the tenants against any specific law is not
easily obtained, but constant observation, and active declared suspicion, will
do a good deal in the way of prevention. Disorderly people grow cautious how
they behave when they know that their practices are understood and watched. Few
pockets are picked under a gas lamp."</p>
<p>It is possible that many persons may conceive the striking pictures presented
to them in this Drama have not their parallel in real life, but are exaggerated,
wrought up, and coloured, merely for the sake of effect. That such is not the
case, the testimony of individuals of the highest integrity and intellect, given
before a Committee of the House of Commons appointed to enquire into the subject
in 1837, will sufficiently evince. "The Calendar of human sins," says the writer
we have just quoted, " contains no crime, however private and domestic, which
does not directly or indirectly work some social mischief, whether by the injury
done to its immediate victims, the evil of its example, or by its demoralising
effect on the delinquent himself as a member of society. To prove how offenders
are first trained to vice, what haunts are kept open for them, and where they
find their markets, there is the evidence of Mr. Wakefield. He remarks 'there
did exist, and he believes exists still, a great number of people in London,
whose <pb n="3"/> sole occupation, whose trade, and whose means of livelihood,
is seducing young people to the commission of crimes of depredation — many of
them women, sometimes men, who watch for boys loitering about in the
neighbourhood, and take opportunities of making acquaintance with them, induce
them to get into debt, and then suggest to them, for the first time, the idea of
robbing their masters (if they happen to be apprentices) or their parents. These
persons, who sometimes keep small shops, are frequently the receivers of stolen
goods.' " In illustration of that part of the Drama which relates to the
infamous Fagin, and the system of decoy and training pursued by him, there is
the testimony of Mr. Richard Gregory, a gentleman of much experience—speaking of
lodging houses, like that to which the young, hapless hero of this Drama was
conveyed, he says, " the mischief of them is, boys and girls of tender age are
suffered to remain there to be fed, and they go out to thieve. The girls luring
persons to these houses, where they plunder them,—-the owners of the houses
receiving the plunder. These boys and girls are sent out morning, noon, and
night; the boys for the purpose of picking pockets—the girls for the purposes
mentioned."</p>
<p>The city officers in pursuing that great receiver of stolen goods, Ikey
Solomons, discovered cellars and trap doors, and all sorts of places of
concealment, which they found full of stolen goods. There seems no reason to
believe that any effectual check has been given to these depositories of crime,
for Mr. Wakefield, only last year, referred the Committee to a class of houses
existing in all the poorer parts of London, and kept for the use of thieves,
where they meet receivers of stolen goods, plan robberies, and lie in
concealment for some time after their commission of any crime which has excited
observation.</p>
<p>Thus it will be seen in this Drama. It's great original, who verbally
speaking, may truly be termed akin to Hogarth, has raised a beacon on the basis
of truth to warn the erring, guide the inexperienced, instruct the ignorant to
avoid the shoals by which they are surrounded, and forcibly inculcate the great
moral lesson, that vice, however prosperous for a time, will sooner or later
meet with punishment and disgrace, while virtue, whatever be its trials and
temptations, will ultimately secure a lasting and just reward.</p>

<head>Synopsis</head>
<head> With Extracts and Sketches of the Local Scenery and Incidents of the
celebrated Novel of Oliver Twist. </head>
<p>The Scenery either from designs made upon the spot by Mr. Brunning, or from
the Etchings which so richly illustrate the Work, by the talented George
Cruikshank.</p>

<p>Interior Of The "Three Cripples,"</p>
<p>Meeting of the Fence and the Thieves—The Persecutor of the Orphan—and the
Plot.</p>
<p>Parlour Of Mrs. Corney-The Tea Table.</p><quote>
<p>"It was bleak, dark, and piercing cold; it was a night for the well-housed
and fed to draw round the bright fire, and thank God they were at home, and for
the homeless starving wretch to lay him down and die. Many hunger-worn outcasts
close their eyes in our bare streets at such times, who (let their crimes have
been what they may) can hardly open them to a more bitter
world."</p></quote></item>
<item>
<p>The Application for an Apprentice—The Working of the Plot—Its Defeat, and the
just Escape of Oliver.</p>
<pb n="5"/>
<p>The Undertaker's Shop. The Parochial Coffin.</p><quote>
<p>" 'It's only about young Twist—a very good looking boy that, my dear." ' He
need be,' says she, 'for he eats enough.'</p>
<p>'There's an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear, which is very
interesting—he would make a delightful mute—not a regular mute to attend
grown-up people, but only for children's practice—it would be very new to have a
mute in proportion, my dear.'"Mr .Bumble entered the shop, drew forth his pocket
book, from which he selected a scrap of paper, which he handed over to
Sowerberry—'Aha!' said the undertaker, with a lively countenance, 'an order for
a coffin, eh?' 'For a coffin first, and a parochial funeral afterwards,' replied
Mr. Bumble, fastening the strap of the leathern pocket book, which like himself,
was very corpulent."</p>
<p>"'Work'us,' said Noah, 'how's yer mother?' 'She's dead,' replied Oliver,
'don't you say anything about her to me.' 'But yer must know,' continued Noah,
'work'us, yer mother was a right down bad un.' 'What did you say?' inquired
Oliver, looking up quickly. ' A regular right down bad un,' replied Noah coolly.
Crimson with fury, Oliver started up, overthrew chair and table, seized Noah by
the throat, shook him in the violence of his rage till his teeth chattered in
his head, and collecting his whole force in one heavy blow, felled him to the
ground.—Oliver locked up for the night—he cancels his indentures."</p></quote>
</item>
<item><label>Act II .</label>
<p>The Highgate Gatehouse. The Artful Dodger And The Early
Breakfast.</p><quote>"'Hollo, my covey, what's the row ?' Oliver thought that
the young gentleman who thus addressed him was one of the queerest looking boys
that he had ever seen ; he was short of his age, with rather bow legs, and
little sharp ugly eyes. He wore a man's coat, which reached nearly to his heels.
He had turned the cuffs back half way up his arm to get his hands out of the
sleeves, apparently with the ultimate view of thrusting them into the pockets of
his corduroy trowsers, for there he kept them. He was altogether as roystering
and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six, or something less,
in his bluchers."</quote></item>
<item>
<p>Fagin's Den, in the Neighbourhood of Field Lane. The Introduction</p><quote>
<p>"When they reached the bottom of the hill, his conductor catching him by the
arm, pushed open the door of a house in Field Lane, and drawing him into the
passage, closed it behind them. 'Now then,' cried a voice from below in reply to
a whistle. 'Plummy and slamm,' answered the Dodger—this seemed to be some
watchword, or signal that all was right. 'There's two on yer', said the man, '
who's the t'other one?' 'A new pal,' replied Jack <pb n="6"/> Dawkins, pulling
Oliver forward. 'Is Fagin up stairs ?' said he. 'Yes,' said the other, 'and
sorting the wipes—up with ye.'"</p>
<p>" In a frying pan which was on the fire, and which was secured to the mantel
shelf by a string, some sausages were cooking, and standing over them, with a
toasting fork in his hand, was a very old shrivelled Jew. Oliver ate his share
of the supper, and the Jew then mixed a glass of hot gin and water, telling him
he must drink it off directly;—Oliver did as he was desired, and then sunk into
a deep sleep.</p></quote></item>
<item>
<p>The Parlour Of The Matron.</p><quote>"Mr . Bumble's conduct on being left to
himself was rather inexplicable. He opened the closet, counted the tea spoons,
weighed the sugar tongs, closely inspected the silver milk pot, to ascertain
that it was of the genuine metal, and having satisfied his curiosity on these
points, put on his cocked hat corner ways, and danced with much gravity four
distinct times round the table."</quote></item>
<item>
<p>A Parlour In The House Of Mr. Brownlow.</p>
<p>The Sick Boy And His Benefactor.</p><quote>
<p>" 'And when are you going to hear a full, true, and particular account of the
life and adventures of Oliver Twist?' asked Grimwig of Mr. Brownlow. 'To-morrow
morning,' said Mr. Brownlow. 'In the meantime, Oliver, you can go to the
booksellers—say that you have brought these books back, and that you have come
to pay the four pounds ten I owe him.' ' It wont be ten minutes before I
return,' replied Oliver."</p>
<p>" The two friends drew their chairs close to the table, and sat in silent
expectation, with the watch between them. At last it grew so dark that the
figures on the dial were scarcely discernible; but still there the two old
gentlemen continued to sit in silence." </p></quote></item>
<item>
<p>Beershop In Clerkenwell.—The Stratagem.</p><quote>
<p>" 'What the devil's this ?' said a man bursting out of a beershop, 'Come home
to your poor mother, you young dog. What books are these ? Give 'em here.' With
these words the man tore the volumes from his grasp, and struck him on the head.
In another moment Oliver was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts, and
forced along them at a pace which rendered his cries
unintelligible.</p></quote></item>
<item>
<p>The Den Of Fagin. —The Re-Capture. </p><quote>
<p>" 'So you wanted to get away, my tear,' said the Jew, taking up a jagged and
knotted club which lay in a corner of the fire-place, 'eh ?' when the girl
rushing forward, wrested it from his hands."</p>
<p>" There is something about a roused woman, especially if she adds to all her
other strong passions the fierce impulses of recklessness and despair, which few
men like to provoke."</p></quote></item>
<item>
<p>Interior of the Parochial Orphan Asylum.</p>
<p>The Journey To London.</p><quote>" 'I am going to London,' said Mr. Bumble to
Mrs. Mann., An action is coming on about a settlement, and the Board has
appointed me to depose the matter before the Quarter Sessions at
Clerkenwell.</quote>
<pb n="8"/></item>
<item>
<quote>"The two women servants ran up stairs to carry the intelligence that Mr.
Giles had captured a robber. In the midst of this noise and commotion was heard
a sweet female voice which quelled it in an instant."</quote>
</item>

<p>Sikes' Garret.—The Broken Promise.</p><quote>" She struggled and implored by

<item>
<p>The Workhouse Parlour. The Stranger And The Bribe.</p><quote>" ' She spoke of
a young creature,' replied the matron, ' who has brought a child into the world
some years before ; not merely in the same room, but in the same bed in which
she there lay dying' </quote></item>
<item>
<p>London Bridge and the River Thames.</p>
<p>The Midnight Meeting. </p><quote>
<p>" The steps to which the girl had pointed were those which on the Surrey
bank, and on the same side of the bridge as St. Saviour's Church, form a landing
stairs from the river."</p>
<p>"Peeping out more than once to make sure he was unobserved, Noah Claypole
darted away, and made for the Jew's house as fast as his legs could carry him.

feelings."</quote></p></item>

<p>The Garret Of Sikes.</p>

<p>An Old House In Jacob's Island.</p>
<p>On the Banks of Folly Ditch. — The Desperado's Death. </p><quote>
<p>"In a neighbourhood beyond Dockhead, in the Borough of Southwark, stands
Jacob's Island, surrounded by a muddy ditch, six or eight feet deep when the
tide is in, once called Mill Pond, but known in these days as Folly Ditch."</p>
<p>"The murderer sat his foot against the stack of chimneys, fastened one end of
the rope firmly round it, and with the other made a strong running noose.
Missing his aim he fell into the ditch, and striking his head against a stone,
dashed out his brains."</p></quote></item>

<p>About fourteen or fifteen years ago, said the ould pauper, one stormy night,
a loud ringing at St. Nicholas' Workhouse gates aroused the inmates. When the
gate was opened, two men entered carrying a woman, who seemed exhausted and
dying. They had discovered her in the high road, sinking and worn out with
fatigue and want. She was a good-looking girl, and must have walked far, for her
shoes were torn to pieces.</p>
<pb n="10"/>
<p>Within three hours of her being brought there, she gave birth to a male child
and expired. As a reward for her services, she gave the woman who attended her
this watch. <stage>(Monk listens attentively to this recital, which seems to

before the morning of my execution. I sat in the dark cold cell, and, do what I
could, I could not help hearing some one speak, in a loud voice, the words that
the judge had said to me, "To be hanged by the neck till I was dead;" and then I
thought of the many men I had brought to the same end, and joked at them, too,
because I saw them die with a prayer upon their lips.—Some there are who cannot
count the number of their loves; I cannot number the number of my hates.—With
what a rattling noise the drop goes down, and how suddenly changed from strong
and vigorous men to dangling heaps of clothes. "To be hanged by the neck till I
am dead !"—and is this—no ! twas a dream, and dreams by contraries go. Be of
