<sp who="#L0283_F1">
<l>When I was a fairy, just turned of fifteen,</l>
<l>As fair as a fairy could be,</l>
<l>I whisk'd through the key-holes and danced on the green, </l>
<l>But now that won't do for me—for me, &amp;c.</l>
<l>I then was invited to every fine feast, </l>
<l>Each wedding and christening to see ;</l>
<l>But now I am old, no one cares in the least,</l>
<l>Nor e'en asks what's become of me—of me, &amp;c.</l>
<l>But I'm living yet, and though centuries old, </l>
<l>Still as potent as fairy can be;</l>
<l>And the next time I'm treated with scorn, I'll make bold </l>
<l>To shew them what 'tis to slight me—slight me, &amp;c.</l>
<l>I'm far from well—I've got the spleen—the vapours. </l>
<l>What makes 'em so late with the morning papers ? </l>
<l>Neglected here, e'en by my sister sprites, </l>
<l>Scandal and tea are now my sole delights.</l>

"Overland dispatch." What's this I pray ?</l>
<l>"At noon precisely, on the first of May, </l>
<l>Her majesty the Queen of Noland, brought her </l>
<l>Most loving lord and king, a little daughter, </l>
<l>To the great joy of all the court and nation,</l>
<l>After ten years of anxious expectation." </l>
<l>There—there a month ago, and none before</l>
<l>Could tell me of this news—but stay, here's more. </l>
<l>"We understand the christening's fixed for—" Eh ! </l>
<l>"The 30th instant. "Why—yes—that's to-day! " </l>
<l>And that the fairies have all been invited </l>
<l>To dinner." All but me—again I'm slighted. </l>
<l>'Tis well! the time is come on which I reckon'd. </l>
<l>My Dragon to the door in half a second !</l>
<l>My crown, my mantle, and my crutched stick! <stage>(Elves bring them and
assist her to dress)</stage></l>
<l>Oh! I will have such vengeance !</l>
<stage>A Fiery Dragon appears at window L. C, which is thrown open —Elves exeunt
R. and L.</stage>
<l>Now then! <stage>(seating herself)</stage> Quick!</l>

better known under the title of ‘Nix my dolly, pals,—fake away!’ sprang into
extra-ordinary popularity, being set to music by Rodwell, and chanted by
glorious Paul Bedford and clever little Mrs. Keeley.
