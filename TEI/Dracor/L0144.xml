   <stage type="setting">SCENE I.—A Drawing Room at Mrs. Somerton’s; a fire-place at C. with a bell
    rope on each side of it; doors R. C. and L. C.; above the door R. C. a small window; window
    R. 2 E.; a clock on the mantel-piece; a work table L., on which is a writing desk; another table
    in C. of the stage, with papers, books, &amp;c. strewed on it; chairs, &amp;c., &amp;c.; another
    door at R. 2 E. Stage dark. A loud ringing at door bell heard.</stage>

    <p><stage>(throwing a hasty look round the room, then—aside)</stage> Come, I’ve effected an
     entrance, at all events! so far, so well, provided I’m not compelled to beat a retreat before
     I’ve accomplished my object. <stage>(walks to various parts of room, examining, &amp;c.,

    <speaker>David.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(all this time examining Ratcliffe from head to foot with his lantern—aside)</stage>
     Well, this be about the free and easiest chap I ever cut in with; he almost pulls the gate bell
     down to begin with, and when I opens the door—thinking in course it’s missus come home—in he
     walks, and without so much as rubbing his boots on the door mat, tells me to light him up
     stairs, at four o’clock in the morning, too. <stage>(aloud)</stage> Who be ye, zur? I know it
     don’t become a servant to be inquisitive—so if you’ll only tell me who ye be, what ye be, why
     you come here, what you want here, where you come from, and a few other
     <emph>particklers</emph>, I’ll be satisfied and ask no questions.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_M1">

    <p>If you want missus, she be gone from home. She be at a grand ball, and if she finds you here
     when she comes home, she’ll blow me up in fine style, as sure as my name’s——</p>

    <p><stage>(turning towards David)</stage> Now hark ye, David. There’s nothing more offensive to
     me, David, than familiarity in a servant, David; but in consideration, David, of your having
     only recently entered Mrs. Somerton’s service——</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_M3">

    <p>He knows that, too.</p>

    <speaker>Rat.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(aside)</stage> That’s lucky!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_M3">
    <speaker>David.</speaker>
    <p>Why missus has been expecting of you the last three days. It was only just afore she went out
     she said to me, “David,” said she, “if my cousin should happen to arrive from London before I
     get home, show him every attention,” says she!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_M1">
    <speaker>Rat.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(aside)</stage> Her cousin, egad! he takes me for that simpleton Percy Postlethwaite;
     not very complimentary, perhaps, but decidedly lucky! <stage>(aloud)</stage> Yes, David, here I
     am, at last; and how is Mrs. Somerton?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_M3">
    <speaker>David.</speaker>
    <p>Mrs. Somerton! is that the way you speak of your cousin? go along, do. <stage>(poking
     Ratcliffe in the side)</stage> Ah! Mr. Percy Postlethwaite, you be a lucky young chap to get
     such a wife, I can tell ’ee.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_M1">
    <speaker>Rat.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(aside)</stage> Wife! so, so, Mr. Percy Postlethwaite, matters are in a more forward
     state than you led me to believe.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_M3">
    <speaker>David.</speaker>
    <p>You’ll find supper all ready for ’ee in the library, <stage>(pointing)</stage> so I’ll just
     light the candles.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_M1">
    <speaker>Rat.</speaker>
    <p>By all means, David. <stage>(aside)</stage> He does’nt know me.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_M3">
    <speaker>David.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(while lighting the candles)</stage> Missus ’ll be mortal glad to see ’ee, and as for
     Peggy, she won’t know whether she be standing on her head or her heels.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_M1">
    <speaker>Rat.</speaker>
    <p>I’m sure I’m very much obliged to Peggy. <stage>(aside)</stage> Who’s Peggy?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_M3">
    <speaker>David.</speaker>
    <p>And no wonder; she tells me many’s the time she’s dangled ’ee on her knee, afore ye were
     breeched; <stage>(imitating)</stage> but ye know all about that.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_M1">
    <speaker>Rat.</speaker>
    <p>Of course. I’ve the most distinct recollection of everything that happened to me before I was
     breeched.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_M3">
    <speaker>David.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(having lighted candles)</stage> There, and now I’ll go down stairs and wait for
     missus; and as soon as she comes in, I’ll say to her——</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_M1">
    <speaker>Rat.</speaker>
    <p>Not one word, either to her or to Peggy! I wish to give them both an agreeable surprise,
     David; you understand, eh?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_M3">
    <speaker>David.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(hesitating)</stage> I think I do!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_M1">
    <speaker>Rat.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(giving him money)</stage> There’s a crown for you—think again.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_M3">
    <speaker>David.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(pocketing money)</stage> I’m sure I do! I’ll be as dumb as an oyster.
     <stage>(going—stops)</stage> As I said before, supper be all ready in t’other room,
     <stage>(going—stops)</stage> and if ’ee want anything you needn’t ring for me, ’cause I be
     going to take a bit of a snooze before the kitchen fire. <stage>(yawning)</stage> How sleepy I
     be to be sure.</p>
   </sp>

   <stage>Exit at door, L. C.</stage>

   <pb n="5"/>

   <sp who="#L0144_M1">
    <speaker>Rat.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(watching David out, then goes quickly up and closes the door)</stage> Alone at
     last—now then to work. <stage>(takes a pair of pistols from his coat pocket, which he places on
     table)</stage> But first, as ladies invariably fly to the bell ropes to raise an alarm, I must
     take the liberty of cutting these. <stage>(taking knife out of his pocket, and cutting the bell
     ropes)</stage> Now to examine the means of escape, in case of interruption—<stage>(opening
     window and looking out)</stage>—the garden—a small conservatory underneath—that’s awkward; but,
     luckily, there’s an apple tree so conveniently close as to make a very tolerable ladder on an
     emergency, so far perfectly satisfactory—and if my information is only tolerably correct, and
     it ought to be considering the trouble I’ve had in obtaining it, <stage>(taking small pocket
     book from his waistcoat and opening it)</stage> this door should lead to Mrs. Somerton’s
     chamber—<stage>(opening door at L., and looking in)</stage>—exactly, and very elegantly
     appointed indeed. <stage>(closes door, and again looking at his pocket book)</stage>—“near the
     door a table”—precisely—<stage>(laying his hand on the table)</stage>—“on the table a small
     writing desk”—here it is—<stage>(laying his hand on the writing desk)</stage>—locked, and the
     key taken out, that of course I expected; but as I have ascertained that between the hours of
     12 and 1 yesterday it became the temporary receptacle of a pocket book containing bank notes to
     the amount of fifteen thousand pounds, it is not likely I should come unprovided with the means
     of securing such a treasure. <stage>(takes out a bunch of small keys, some of which he
     tries—produces a chisel from his coat pocket, and is about to insert it under the lid of the
     box, a loud ring at gate bell heard)</stage> Mrs. Somerton returned. <stage>(runs to door,
     L. U. E.—ring repeated)</stage> Again! Stay—<stage>(listening)</stage> The window—quick!
     <stage>(runs to window)</stage> A man in the garden, and cautiously making towards this window.
     Who can he be? and what can be his object? Not the same as mine surely—egad, that would be
     comical enough. If I could only observe—— Ah—that door. <stage>(blows out the candle, and
     gropes his way to door, R.; at the moment that he enters the room, R., Postlethwaite’s head is
     seen at the window, R. U. E.)</stage></p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_M2">
    <speaker>Pos.</speaker>
    <p>I’ve done it! I’ve been ringing at the bell long enough, so I’ve been obliged to effect an
     entrance by the window; <stage>(putting one leg over the window sill)</stage> and let me
     observe to the inexperienced in these matters, that the fact of threading one’s way up a
     densely wooded apple tree on a pitch dark night is a gymnastic feat more easily imagined than
     accomplished. <stage>(gets in at window—he has a carpet bag)</stage> However, as I said before,
     I’ve done it, and what’s more I live to tell it, though I may be allowed to remark that,
     considering my cousin, Mrs. Somerton, has been expecting me—<emph>me, her affianced
     husband—</emph>for the last three nights, I think she might have allowed one of her domestics
     to sit up for me: however, I’m not going to quarrel with her, no—no—I cannot forget that she’s
     my cousin, and the only child of my honoured and lamented uncle—I mean aunt—no, uncle—and now
     that the law suit has been decided in her favour, and that she steps into possession of fifteen
     thousand pounds, her late husband’s fortune, I feel that to upbraid her at such a moment would
     be unmanly.
     <pb n="6"/> There’s a spark of fire left in the grate I declare—that’s lucky! I’ll light a
     candle if I can find one. <stage>(feeling about)</stage> Here’s one—no, it’s a scent bottle—now
     I’ve got it—<stage>(takes candle, and goes towards fireplace)</stage>—and now for a piece of
     paper. <stage>(takes a paper out of his pocket, and about to tear it)</stage> Stop—it won’t do
     to tear this, this is yesterday’s Times, in which I find that my friend Captain Ratcliffe has
     been appointed to the situation of Chief Superintendent of the Rural Police, of the Western
     Division of the County of Kent, and as I know he’s been here at Tunbridge Wells for the last
     week, I’ve determined to find him out, and be the first to congratulate him—this’ll do!
     <stage>(taking another piece of paper, and lighting the candle with it)</stage> There—and now——
     <stage>(seeing a letter on the table, and taking it up)</stage> What’s this? “Colonel Boldwig
     requests the honour—Mrs. Somerton’s company—Thursday evening—quadrilles, &amp;c. &amp;c.” Then
     she’s not at home; then, egad, I’ll wait for her here—but not in this costume—no, I’ll just
     change my coat, et cetera: and, probably, my et cetera requires changing more than my coat,
     because naturally in ascending a tree one occasionally requires to sit down, consequently, it
     naturally follows that one’s et cetera, upon which one does sit down—of course, it stands to
     reason—so here goes. <stage>(taking up the candle, carpet bag, and umbrella, and going towards
     door, R. C., and enters. Scene again dark. At this moment Ratcliffe opens door at R., enters,
     moves across on tiptoe, and locks the door at R. C.)</stage></p>

     now, while I’m taking all these gimcracks and finery out of your hair, you shall tell me all
     about the grand doings at the ball. I warrant me, what the colonel’s footmen said of you was
     quite true.</p>

   <sp who="#L0144_F4">

     <pb n="7"/> not one of them condescended to select me for a partner; but then, on the other

   <sp who="#L0144_F5">
    <speaker>Peggy.</speaker>
    <p>No! Is there?—he must be quite a curiosity! Oh, ma’am, who is he?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_F4">
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p> It’s a long story, Peggy, and it’s getting late.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_F5">
    <speaker>Peggy.</speaker>
    <p>It’s never too late to hear good news.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_F4">
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p> Then listen, Peggy. You remember that about ten months ago I was earnestly advised by my
     physicians to pay a short visit to the continent.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_F5">
    <speaker>Peggy.</speaker>
    <p>Yes; and I remember too that you came home quite an altered woman—<emph>I</emph> never saw
     hair dressed in such an extraordinary style—never!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_F4">
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p> Don’t interrupt me. I had been in Paris about three weeks, when one evening on my return
     from the opera, I found a note on my dressing table, containing these words—“I have seen you,
     and to see you is to love you. I am young, tolerably handsome, and sufficiently rich, yet as I
     cannot presume to present myself to you until you permit me to do so, I shall venture to remind
     you from time to time that I am near you.”</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_F5">
    <speaker>Peggy.</speaker>
    <p>Well I’m sure, Mr. Impudence; and what was the fellow’s name?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_F4">
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p> There was no name, but merely the initials C. R.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_F5">
    <speaker>Peggy.</speaker>
    <p>C. R. Samuel something or other I dare say—but he gave his address?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_F4">
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p> No; simply the words “Post Office, to be left till called for.” Of course, I took no notice
     of it whatever, and had forgotten the circumstance altogether, when a month afterwards to the
     very day—the very hour—I was then at Florence, I received a second communication, couched in
     precisely the same words, and again subsequently at Venice, Naples, and Milan.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_F5">
    <speaker>Peggy.</speaker>
    <p>Dear, dear, it’s as good as a play! Then you never took any notice of the fellow at all?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_F4">
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p> Yes; a circumstance, the bare recollection of which makes me shudder even at this lapse of
     time, compelled me to break through the silence I had hitherto imposed upon myself: in
     travelling through Switzerland, on my return to England, the carriage which I occupied was one
     night placed in imminent peril by the restiveness of one of the horses; fortunately, I was
     asleep, and was not aware of my danger till I was assured of my safety—within a few feet of a
     fearful precipice, the traces had been cut, by a man who had evidently followed me, judge then
     of my astonishment when a voice uttered these words in my ear, “You see, madam, I have kept my
     promise, I am <emph>still near you.</emph>”</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_F5">
    <speaker>Peggy.</speaker>
    <p>Well, he was a fine brave gentleman, whoever he was; and what was he like—eh?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_F4">
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p> He had disappeared before I could even thank him for his timely and generous assistance.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_F4">
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p> Well? <stage>(hesitatingly)</stage> his next letter, which reached me shortly after my
     return to England, did <emph>not</emph> remain unanswered.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_F5">
    <speaker>Peggy.</speaker>
    <p>I should think not, indeed! and what did you say to Mr. C. R.?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_F4">
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p> The truth! that my hand was promised to my cousin, Percy Postlethwaite; that his father had
     once saved <emph>mine</emph> from ruin, who made me promise, as the only means of testifying
     <emph>his</emph> gratitude to the father, to marry the son.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_F5">
    <speaker>Peggy.</speaker>
    <p>Ah! and that, of course, was a settler for Mr. C. R.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_F4">
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p> On the contrary, his answer to my letter ran thus:—“Love like mine never despairs. I will
     still be near you, for I still hope”—and yet for the last <emph>two months</emph> he has ceased
     to write.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_F5">
    <speaker>Peggy.</speaker>
    <p>Of course he has! and high time, too, considering you told him you were Mrs. Postlethwaite,
     as was to be.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0144_F4">
    <speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
    <p> Very true; and yet <stage>(after a slight hesitation)</stage> no matter, go to bed, Peggy.

     tiptoe along that passage, when I was almost knocked off my legs by a piercing shriek. “My

     grasp I seized the handle of the door—it was locked, upon which with one blow of this fist—you

     there, extended upon the hearth rug, with her head on the fender lay my poor cousin in a dead

   <head>Transcriber’s Note</head>

   <p>This transcription is based on images digitized by Google from a copy held by Shields Special
    Collections of the University of California, Davis Library. The images are available through the
    HathiTrust Digital Library at:<ref target="http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007431700">catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/ 007431700</ref></p>

   <p>In general, I have retained variant spellings (e.g., “tarletan”, “trowsers”, “does’nt”,
    “her’s”, and “your’s”) and the idiosyncrasies of the original punctuation. However, for the sake
    of consistency and to correct obvious errors, the following changes were made:</p>

   <list>
    <item>The spacing of the abbreviations for the entrances and exits has been made
     consistent.</item>

    <item>p. 2: Mrs. Somerton,—Green tarletan ball dress—Changed comma to a period for
     consistency.</item>

    <item>p. 4: Rat. By all means, David. <stage>(aside)</stage> he does’nt know me.—Capitalized
     “he”.</item>

    <item>p. 9: for the amount at once (taking a piece—Inserted a period after “once”.</item>

    <item>p. 9: I had taken that little precaution against interruption (resumes his
     writing)—Inserted a period after “interruption”.</item>

    <item>p. 11: makes a profound bow, and exits, L. U. E)—Inserted a period after “E”.</item>

    <item>p. 12: I’ll run for him this monent,—Changed “monent” to “moment”.</item>

    <item>p. 12: no, my friend (running to door, L. C.) Holloa,—Inserted a period after
     “friend”.</item>

    <item>p. 12: to ring the bell, and the bell rope’s cut—Changed the comma to a closing
     parenthesis.</item>

    <item>p. 12: raise an alarm at all events (pulling both triggers—Inserted a period after
     “events”.</item>

    <item>p. 12: Oh, if I had only known that (about to get out at the window)—Inserted a period
     after “that”.</item>

    <item>p. 14: Pos. (pulling him back) you can’t till your successor is appointed.—Capitalized
     “you”.</item>

    <item>p. 14: That’s right—you must know then (seats himself)—Inserted a period after
     “then”.</item>

    <item>p. 15: My cousin, Captain Ratcliffe (introducing them.—Inserted a period after
     “Ratcliffe”.</item>

    <item>p. 15: Rat. True! smiling.—“smiling” is a stage direction, so this line has been changed
     to: “Rat. True! (smiling)”</item>

    <item>p. 16: Rat. (smiling again) True,—Comma changed to a period.</item>

    <item>p. 16: Pos. Yes, yes, (aside to him) That’ll do—she can’t bear it.—Changed comma after
     second “yes” to a period.</item>

    <item>p. 16: Rat. (to Mrs. S.) Bank notes, I presume?—“Mrs.” changed to small caps in the html
     version and all caps in the text version for consistency.</item>

    <item>p. 16: this bold and impudent villain. (Ratcliffe slightly starts) treating the matter
     as—Changed period after “villain” to a comma.</item>

    <item>p. 17: Lor, Master Percy, is that you? throwing her arms—Inserted a beginning parenthesis
     before “throwing”.</item>

    <item>p. 17: Lor love’ee, (about to embrace him again.—Changed comma after “love’ee” to a
     period.</item>

    <item>p. 18: here sit down, (making Pos. sit down—Changed comma to a period.</item>

    <item>p. 19: The devil! (aloud) and is name is——Changed first “is” to “his”. </item>

    <item>p. 20: we must not mince matters. (imitating Ratcliffe’s manner.)—Inserted closing
     quotation mark after “matters.”</item>

    <item>p. 20: more courage than I imagined. I was about to observe—Inserted “(aloud)” after “than
     I imagined.”</item>
