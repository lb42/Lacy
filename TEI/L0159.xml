<performance>
<p>First produced at the Royal Olympic Theatre, Monday,July 4th, 1853.</p>
<p>The Scenery, new and old, has been brushed up by Mr. Shalders, assisted by
Mr. W. Shalders, under the direction of Mr. William Shalders. The Characters
will find themselves smart under a sound dressing from Mr. Allen and Mrs.
Rawlings. The Mechanical Effects, at which we usually find Matthews at home,
will on the present occasion be much more easily imagined than described. It is
expected the Appointments, made under the liberal ministry of Mr. Lightfoot,
will give general satisfaction. The Music will be well treated by Mr. Barnard,
although he intends to handle it with his usual but by no means ordinary
<hi>violins.</hi>

<head> Scene I.— Interior of a Pawnbroker's Shop.</head>
<stage> Enter Shylock followed by Bassanio, R.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>Three thousand ducats for three months, you said.</l>
<l>Humph ! well, I'll think of it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bass.</speaker>
<l>You're not afraid</l>
<l>To take Antonio's bond ? or, if his bail</l>
<l>Be insufficient, be sure mine shan't fail.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>Three thousand ducats for three lunar months ?</l>
<l>I must think twice ere I reply at once;</l>
<l>Three thousand ducats is a good round sum— </l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bass. </speaker>
<l>For which Antonio's bound : your answer, come ?</l>
<l>I'm not the sort of man to seek a flaw</l>
<l>In the entangled meshes of our law,</l>
<l>Nor try escape through any hole or cranny.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>Oh!</l>
<l>I could not think base any how, Bassanio!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bass.</speaker>
<l>But fair and plain with all.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>A virtue rare !</l>
<l>
<stage>(aside)</stage> In my opinion, much more <hi>plain</hi> than
<hi>fair</hi>.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bass.</speaker>
<l>Upright and downright is <hi>my</hi> constant rule.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>Doubtless an upright man, <stage>(aside)</stage> a downright fool.</l>
<l>
<stage>(aloud)</stage> Antonio's a good man.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bass.</speaker>
<l>Yes—do you know</l>
<l>Aught contrary ?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>Oh! <hi>tout au contraire</hi> —No !</l>
<pb n="4"/>
<l>At him, believe me, I don't mean a rap at all, </l>
<l>But all his property is floating capital, </l>
<l>Which, while it floats, all's well—but then his ventures</l>
<l>Are such as, you must own, sir, prudence censures;</l>
<l>For, if report speaks truly of his fleet, </l>
<l>One's to the Indies bound and one to Crete, </l>
<l>Which ventures, at the least, are <hi>Indis-crete.</hi>
</l>
<l>And others widely squandered—then again </l>
<l>Ships are but boards and sailors naught but men;</l>
<l>Add to the ocean's perils, too, the fears</l>
<l>Of the more free than welcome Buccaneers.</l>
<l>Without a "by your leave" or "if you please" upon it,</l>
<l>Whate'er they sees upon the seas they seize upon it.</l>
<l>Yet may I take this bond, I think—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bass.</speaker>
<l>You may.</l>
<l>Here comes Antonio.</l>
</sp>
<stage> Enter Antonio at door C. from street. </stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<l>Gentlemen, good day;</l>
<stage>(Antonio and Bassanio converse apart)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>
<stage>(aside)</stage> How like a swindling Publican he looks,</l>
<l>Applying for his license, when the books </l>
<l>Are crowded with complaints of open house</l>
<l>At two o'clock A.M., and drunken rows!</l>
<l>I hate him as a conscientious nuisance</l>
<l>Who'd bring down our Venetian rate of usance! </l>
<l><stage>(aloud)</stage> This is indeed an honour, sir—good day.</l>
<l>Is there no little business in my way, </l>
<l>Such as a watch or handkerchief to spout,</l>
<l>That I can serve you in ? <stage>(aside)</stage> And serve you out.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker> Ant. </speaker>
<l>Shylock, you know I borrow not, nor lend</l>
<l>In general—yet to oblige a friend, </l>
<l>I will negociate a trifling loan o' you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>I marvel you're seen here, Signor Antonio.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<l>For once I break a custom, so, my buck, Hand over.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>Stop though, I've a crow to pluck</l>
<l>With you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<l>'Twere pity now we've gone so far,</l>
<l>That any <hi>crow</hi> of yours should a <hi>bar</hi>
</l>
<l>To our transactions.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bass.</speaker>
<l>Come—you'll see about it,</l>
<l>Just now we really can't get on without it.</l>

<head>Duett. Air.— <title>"Sprig of Shillelah."</title></head>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>Good Mister Antonio, often when on</l>
<l>The Rialto, my gaberdine you've spit upon,</l>
<l>And rated and chaffed at my 60 per cent,</l>
<l>You've called me "Old Fagin" usurious dog,"</l>
<l>And said, though a Jew, I could go the whole hog.</l>
<l>Yet here you come now and say "Shylock do lend</l>
<l>Me some money!" I wish you may get it, my friend;</l>
<l>So don't think you shall have it, nor Shylock so green!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<l>Expectorate, Shylock, I did on your dress,</l>
<l>But a rating I did not expect I confess,</l>
<l>For I'll give you my bill at your 60 per cent.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>Who voided his rheum on my beard, I presume,</l>
<l>In decency should have a-voided my <hi>room,</hi>
</l>
<l>For though I'm a Jew, you'll discover at need,</l>
<l>I'm no animal of the Jerusalem breed, </l>
<l>So, my sprig, you shall have it—when Shylock's so green.</l>
</sp>
</spGrp>
<sp>
<l>Shall I say," Would'nt ask money from a cur?" </l>
<l>Or, bending low speak humbly thus, "Fair sir,</l>
<l>" Last week you graciously were pleased to lick me,</l>
<l>" On Thursday you were good enough to kick me.</l>
<l>" Yes, though my figure might a Christian melt,</l>
<l>" On the Rialto your <hi>real-toe</hi> I've felt!</l>
<l>" Full many a time, too, stooping humbly down,</l>
<l>" By a low bob I've saved an entire crown,</l>
<l>" And kept the peace—for which, and like facetiae,</l>
<l>" You're welcome, sir, to all I boast in specie!" </l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant. </speaker>
<l>A truce, sir, to this jesting—you refuse ? </l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>It <hi>does</hi> sound like it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bass.</speaker>
<l>Oh! just as you choose.</l>
<stage>(they are leaving, arm in arm)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>Why, how now, signor—look you how you storm,</l>
<l>I've given you no cause to wax so warm ;</l>
<l>I would be friends with you—whate'er you want, </l>
<l>Lend willingly and take no interest on't.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<l>Whatever sum <hi>?</hi>
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>I've said it— <hi>what-sum-ever.</hi>
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<l>I never knew such self-denial—never!</l>
<stage>(they shake hands)</stage>
<l>You'll take some interest for the loan though ?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>Pooh!</l>
<l>The interest alone I feel for you ;</l>
<pb n="6"/>
<l>Or, if you will, you shall—for mere form's sake.</l>
<l>My merry cove, a merry cove-nant make: </l>
<l>That, if you can't the trifling loan repay </l>
<l>Conveniently by such and such a day, </l>
<l>A pound of flesh t'will then be mine to claim</l>
<l>From any part of you I choose to name.</l>
<l>Ha! ha! the humorous notion make me laugh!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<l>
<stage>(doubtfully)</stage> Does it indeed ? Well, I don't like it half;</l>
<l>Yet, where's the odds—for very well I see</l>
<l>'Tis but a spree, Jew—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>But a <hi>jeu d'esprit.</hi>
</l>
<l>'Tis but—pray don't misconstrue my intent—</l>
<l>I have a leaning towards you, it is lent.</l>
<l>Reflect besides, the forfeiture would be</l>
<l>But pain to you, sir, and not paying to me; </l>
<l>A pound of man's flesh is not, by your leave, </l>
<l>Of half the value of a pound of beef, </l>
<l>Nor were it worth my while to cut and run, </l>
<l>And <hi>carry off,</hi> what is but <hi>carri-on ;</hi>
</l>
<l>It is to buy your favour I extend</l>
<l>This friendship, if you choose to be my friend.</l>
<l>Shake hands—our quarrel is forgot, I hope?</l>
</sp>

<speaker>Bass.</speaker>
<l>I don't like quarrels washed out with <hi>palm soap. </hi>
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<l>I'll seal this bond—Bassanio, hold your tongue, </l>
<l>In this proceeding there can be no wrong.</l>
</sp>

<l>Let's off then to the Notary's.</l>

<l>It grieves me much that you should undertake </l>

<l>So good a friend!</l>

<l>Never shrink, never shrink from a bit of paper!</l>

<l>Holloa!</l>
<l>Bellario's taken ill—well here' a go !</l>
<l>Yet stay—what's this? a friend, who knows the case, </l>
<l>Takes at short notice by our leave his place, </l>
<l>Oh, certainly—by all means, show him in.</l>
<l>You know what you're to do, sir, so begin.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>Which is the merchant here and which the Jew?</l>
</sp>
<pb n="27"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>I'm Shylock, at your service—how d'ye do ?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>
<stage>(to Ant.)</stage> You're taken then in execution ?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<l>Yes,</l>
<l>At which, of course, I'm taken in distress.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>Then must the Jew be merciful, that's flat. </l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>On what compulsion must I ? Tell me that.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>The sayings <hi>must-y</hi> and is soon explained,</l>
<l>The quality of mercy is not strained,</l>
<l>Nor filtered as Thames water needs to be</l>
<l>Before it's drinkable; but mercy free</l>
<l>Springs at the heart, and flows on undistilled, or</l>
<l>Pure from the lips comes as from <hi>Lipscombe's filter! </hi>
</l>
<l>It droppeth as the gentle rain—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>There, stop,</l>
<l>It drops itself, so please, we'll let it drop.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>Nay, come, I'm sure you mean to shew him mercy. </l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy..</speaker>
<l>Do I ? well my opinion's <hi>vice versa.</hi>
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>Deal gently with him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>That would never do,</l>
<l>You would'nt have me Jew and <hi>Gentle</hi> too!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>Come, to a fallen foe one should be kind.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>Is the Venetian a <hi>Venetian blind.</hi>
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>Give him some little time, it isn't clear</l>
<l>His Argosy mayn't after all appear.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>As for his Argosy, young sir, I doubt, </l>
<l>T'would need an <hi>Argus eye</hi> to find it out!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bass.</speaker>
<l>We've offered him three times the borrowed sum</l>
<l>Here, in this sack.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>I shall not take it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>Come,</l>
<l>You will, I'm sure, this trifling favour show, </l>
<l>Here is the money—take the sack and go.</l>
<l>You won't ? Then did I talk till I were hoarse</l>
<l>I fear the law must take its lawful course.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>Oh, wise young judge! discriminating beak!</l>
<l>Precious juvenile! just hear him speak!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>You've brought, of course, altho' I don't a surgeon see. </l>
<l>Some leech to staunch his wound in this emergency ? </l>
<l>For, by that time your vengeance will be sated.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>Pray, is it in the bond so nominated ?</l>
<l>A surgeon ? look then ? You'll not find I'm poz there! </l>
<l>That <hi>item—</hi>
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>Then it's high time that it was there.</l>
<l>The law's on your side though, there's no doubt of it, </l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>A Nonpareil—true as a Derby prophet!</l>
</sp>
<pb n="28"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>
<stage>(to Ant.)</stage> You must, I fear, to this unfeeling man</l>
<l>Lay bare your breast—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<l>Yet stay, is there no plan</l>
<l>No <hi>panacea</hi> for your cruel mood?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>You see the <hi>pan is here</hi> to catch the blood,</l>
<stage>(to Ant.)</stage>
<l>Your woes are great, and I prescribe, to end 'em,</l>
<l>One dose of <hi>steel "hora merid: sumendum."</hi>
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bass.</speaker>
<l>Antonio, I have at home a wife</l>
<l>Whom I love well—yet, her, to save your life, </l>
<l>I'd sacrifice most freely to the Jew.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>
<stage>(aside)</stage> Upon my life that's very kind of you!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grat.</speaker>
<l>I too, sir, have a wife I richly treasure,</l>
<l>But I'd resign her with a deal of pleasure.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ner.</speaker>
<l>
<stage>(aside)</stage> And when she gets you home again, I guess, </l>
<l>You'll pay for your disinterestedness!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<l>I am prepared. <stage>(throws open his waistcoat)</stage>
</l>
<stage>(Shylock approaches him)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>Yet stay—it's clear as mud</l>
<l>This bond says not a word about the blood;</l>
<l>While taking more or less than a pound's weight,</l>
<l>Renders your life and fortunes confiscate!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grat.</speaker>
<l>Our Nonpareil this time has missed his tip,</l>
<l>Now, Infidel, I have you on the hip.</l>
<stage>(Shylock drops his knife and scales, and stands completely
crest-fallen)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>I'm very sorry, Shylock, thus to bore you,</l>
<l>But fancy that slight flaw will slightly floor you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>I feel that flaw's the ground <hi>flaw</hi> of my ruin.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>You know exactly now, sir, what you're doing,</l>
<l>So slice away.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>
<stage>(aside)</stage> I 'gin to doubt though whether</l>
<l>I hadn't better <hi>cut it</hi> altogether.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grat.</speaker>
<l>A Nonpariel beyond all kind of question—</l>
<l>I'm much obliged to you for that suggestion— </l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>Pay thrice the bond and let the Christian go. </l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>Your pardon, Shylock, not exactly so,</l>
<l>The law as yet another hold on thee :</l>
<l>Fair play's a jewel, as the Jew'll see !</l>
<l>Your life is forfeit.</l>
</sp>

<l>Give me my principal and I'll away ?</l>

<l>Best <hi>carry out</hi> your <hi>principle</hi> and stay.</l>
<l>Nay, Shylock, though you choose forgive the debt, </l>
<l>You'd find the law had hold upon you yet.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>I say, young man, your practice rather sharp is.</l>

<speaker>Grat.</speaker>
<l>Not when he practises on the <hi>Jews-harp-ies.</hi>
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<l>Shylock, although your conduct in this case,</l>
<l>In it's whole tenour has been thorough base, </l>
<l>On one condition I won't press the charge, </l>
<l>And you're at liberty to go at large.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>At large ? I feel particularly small, </l>
<l><stage>(aside)</stage> But thank my stars that I can go at all.</l>
<stage>(Shylock is going, but is prevented by the officers of the Court)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<l>There are two points though that I must insist on, </l>
<l>You'll shave your face and look more like a Christian, </l>
<l>And take your daughter to your arms again.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<l>Well, since you've got the upper hand it's plain,</l>
<l>I must knock under—and I will, I swear, </l>
<l>Receive my heiress and cut off my <hi>hair !</hi>

<l>You pardon us, pa?</l>

<l>Yes, howe'er distressing</l>

<l>As for the money that we took in our flight, sir,</l>

<l>Though my address you're pleased, sir, to admire, </l>

<l>Why, lor—sure,</l>

<l>Nerissa? <stage>(they embrace)</stage>

<l>We assumed these legal jetty coats</l>

<l>All explanation to some future day.</l>
</sp>

<l>Then we're all friends?</l>

<sp>

<l>I trust so.</l>

<l><hi>That's</hi> t'wixt ourselves, not very hard to do, </l>
<l>But how shall I contrive to diddle you ?</l>
<l>I'll touch your pity—bear in mind the fact.</l>

<l>Forgive us that—nay more—if you will deign </l>

<l>Some few misters cant abide to laugh </l>
<l>At what's good and Shakspearian, </l>
<l>Or give to what's too sad by half, </l>
<l>An end that's not a dreary 'un. </l>
<l>To such a Critic I would say, </l>
