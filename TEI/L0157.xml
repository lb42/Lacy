<head>A HANDSOME HUSBAND.</head>
<head>Scene I.</head>
<stage> A drawing-room elegantly furnished—folding doors at back — doors right
and left — cabinet, sofa, table, chairs, &amp;c. As the curtain goes up, a loud
double knock is heard at hall door ; enter Servant, shewing in Mr. Wyndham and
Mrs. Melford. Servant places chairs, and exit. </stage>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>I beg, madam, you will be seated. <stage>(she sits)</stage> Rather curious,
that our post-chaises should arrive at the same door at the same instant; that
we should both alight, and at the same time ask the same question of the same
porter :—" Is Mistress Wyndham at home ? " Odd, wasn't it? I offered you my arm;
you did not refuse it;—we entered the house, and ascended to the drawing room; I
presented you with a chair; you did me the favour to accept it. And now, madam,
after all this, perhaps you will condescend to inform me to whom I have the
honour of speaking.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>To Mrs. Melford, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>Mrs. Melford! what, the Hon. Mrs. Melford! friend and schoolfellow of Mrs.
Wyndham ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>The same, sir; though we have not met for some years. When I last saw her,
she was Laura Twisden; now she has the honour of bearing the name of Wyndham. I
haven't the pleasure of knowing Mr. Wyndham; but I esteem, nay, love him, with
all my heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>Madam! <stage>(aside)</stage> Bless my soul, how very odd.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>It's very true, sir; he must be such a good— such a charming man !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>Madam! madam ! you overpower me ! Really, my natural modesty and
diffidence—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p><emph>You</emph>, sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>Yes, madam, <emph>I</emph> am he !—the pure, unadulterated, veritable Mr.
Wyndham, just returned after an absence of two years.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>How, sir? you left your wife after—</p>
</sp>
<pb n="2"/>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>Two months of bliss, which flew past with most frightful rapidity. It's
really astonishing the wonderful difference there is in two months spent with a
lovely woman in a comfortable home, and sixty days passed in the " Spitfire "
with a pack of men.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>But may I take the liberty of asking, sir, what induced you to leave England
?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>A lawsuit, madam, in which our interests were vitally concerned; and which, I
rejoice to say, has terminated favourably.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>And I rejoice to <emph>hear</emph> it, and to make your acquaintance; for, in
spite of your excessive modesty, I repeat what I just now said.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>No, madam ! pray don't, I entreat!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>Your conduct to my dear Laura proves to me that you are a noble, generous
man.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>Noble and generous, madam! what ? because I marry a lovely girl, highly
gifted, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>And blind!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>And blind—the greatest, best gift of all.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>Yes, ma'am; it may seem odd to you, but so it is ; she was made for me.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>Really, sir, you are quite an enigma; do me the favour to explain.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>I will. Condescend to turn your eyes this way, madam; look at me, and tell me
candidly,—no flattering now,—do you think me a handsome man ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>A <emph>handsome</emph> man ! Why, sir, I—I—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>Say no more, madam ; you hesitate—'tis enough. I see how it is, you perfectly
agree with me; you would say—" I am well enough; that is, I am not positively
frightful; I might pass in a crowd ; my sudden appearance would not alarm a
sensible hackney-coach horse." But that is not enough: to find favour with the
fair sex, a man must be decidedly handsome; character, talent, temper, all are
secondary considerations with them. Excuse me, madam, 'tis a melancholy fact,
founded upon my personal experience, that the intrinsic value of a man signifies
little, provided Nature has been externally bountiful.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Mr. Wyndham, you are severe upon us.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>But correct. Pardon me, but I have proved <pb n="5"/>it. I have, in my time,
made love to many women; my addresses have been received—encouraged for a time,
when in has stept some handsome dandy, with no other qualification but intrepid
assurance, which,—pardon me again, madam,—if there is a doubt, generally settles
the question. Continually jilted, I had made up my mind never to marry, until a
lucky chance introduced me to your lovely and deliciously blind friend, Laura
Twisden. For her, beauty and ugliness were mere words; she could neither see her
husband, however frightful, nor any other of the sex, however charming ; the
woman of all others for me. I endeavoured to make myself agreeable;—I suppose I
succeeded ; for I had the felicity of persuading her to change the somewhat
vulgar name of Twisden for that of Wyndham.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. Twisden.</speaker>
<p><stage>(speaking off, R. H.)</stage> Where is he ? in the drawing-room ?—the
dear creature ! <stage>(enters, and throws herself in Wyndham's arms)</stage> My
dear Wyndham ! come back at last ! I am so rejoic'd, that I'm ready to cry; and,
what do I see, Mrs. Melford here also ! Oh! it's too much —too much happiness !
<stage>(they both take her hands, give chair, &amp;c.)</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>Compose yourself, my dear madam ; I am come to stay with you for a short
time, if you will allow me. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Oh! my dear, with the greatest pleasure. <stage>(she gets up, and turns to
Wyndham)</stage> And now that I am a little recovered, I must give you a bit of
a scolding ; for not a line have we received from you for some—oh ! shocking
quantity of months ; I don't know how many.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>Dearest Mrs. T.— <stage>(aside)</stage> I hate the name in full.
<stage>(aloud)</stage> I couldn't write when I was being tossed about on the
restless bosom of Mr. Neptune; and on board the "Spitfire" there was no
<emph>post,</emph> except the captain. But we are talking of captains and
"Spitfires " instead of my wife, who has nothing I'm sure to do with either,
bless her! How is the darling ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Well—quite well.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>Go, then, madam, and inform her gently of my arrival; or shall I at once fly
to her ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Stay, my dear Wyndham, you can't do that, for she is out.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>Out—how unlucky ! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>So it is; and as she is gone shopping it is very <pb n="6"/> uncertain when
she will return. I dare say you haven't forgotten the time such matters occupy.
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>Oh, no ! Who is gone with her ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>She is gone alone.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>Alone! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Oh, yes! she wouldn't trust anybody to purchase ribbons, &amp;c, &amp;c, for
her; she prefers to choose her own colours ; and she is perfectly right, for her
taste is exquisite, I assure you.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>What on earth do you mean? <stage>(aside)</stage> The woman is surely out of
her mind. <stage>(aloud)</stage> Choose her own colours, madam ?—do you really
mean what you say ? </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Of course I do. What makes you stare so? you know what has occurred !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>I, madam! No, madam! what <emph>has</emph> occurred ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>What!—goodness preserve me !—Didn't you get my letter, dated in May last
?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>Never! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Mercy on me!—then you really do know nothing of the famous German doctor
?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>Doctor ! Has she been ill, then?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>The cleverest creature on earth ! I was so delighted with him, that—would you
believe it, Mrs. Melford ? —I positively embraced the dear man!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>But what did he do?—For heaven's sake, tell me!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>What did he do !—gave light and life to our dear Laura !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean, madam ?—What do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Don't be agitated, pray. I should have broken it to you more gently—the happy
news—but I thought my letter—The fact is, my dear Mr. Wyndham—control your
transport,—our dear Laura has regained her sight!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>Is it possible ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>It's all over with me—I'm a lost man!— <stage>(falls in a chair)</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>A lost man !—How ?—What ?—When ?— Where ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p><stage>(starting up)</stage> Have you now to learn, Mrs. T., that my greatest
inducement for marrying your daughter was what you thought her misfortune.</p>
</sp>
<pb n="7"/>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>But my dear Mr. Wyndham—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>Didn't she take it in her head, that I was a handsome man ?—and didn't I
suffer you to keep up the delusion, because I thought it couldn't possibly
signify ? And now that she can see for herself, her eyes will indeed be
opened.—Horrid, execrable German doctor !—Let me fly the house!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>What !—will you not see your wife ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>Now that she can see me!—No, no ; not, at least, till you hare prepared her
for the real truth. I shall hear how she receives it, and shall act accordingly.
Not a word of my arrival.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>But how to prevent her knowing it ? She is, I assure you, very suspicious ;
for she has an idea that she is always being deceived—more particularly about
your return. She constantly rummages my desk and drawers, to seek for any
letters of yours. Every morning, at breakfast, her first question is sure to
be—" Do you think Edward will come to-day ?"—then fixes her eyes on me, as tho'
she would read me thro' and thro' : I couldn't tell her a story for the life of
me. The other morning a young man happened to get out of a coach, at our door :
she started up —the blood rushed to her face—and she exclaimed—" Is that my
husband ?"</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>Some cursed handsome dog, no doubt. No ! my mind's made up—I will not let her
see me until after she has been <emph>warned</emph> of my appearance. Now, do
your best in this; and you, madam <stage>(to Mrs. Melford)</stage> as her
friend, will perhaps kindly interest yourself in this affair ? Reason with
her—soothe her—encourage her.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>Depend on my doing everything in my power.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>And what do you intend to do with yourself?— where do you mean to spend the
day ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>In an omnibus !—that will <emph>distract</emph> my attention. Good by; I
leave my fate in your hands. Ah ! a good thought—make me out much plainer than I
really am! infernally ugly!— downright disgusting !—you understand ; then
perhaps she may be <emph>agreeably</emph> surprised.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>But are you really going?—and where shall we find you ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>I tell you, in an omnibus!—somewhere between Paddington and Mile End!</p>
</sp>
<pb n="8"/>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>But where will you dine?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_M1">
<speaker>Wynd.</speaker>
<p>No where—any where. I'll get a <emph>plain</emph> dinner at an ordinary!
<stage>Exit C. D.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>What a strange man !—what a strange fancy !— for he really is not so very
plain, is he ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>Not at all. <emph>I</emph> rather like his appearance. He is not, perhaps,
what people call good-looking—but he looks — good ! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>And he is what he looks ; a kinder-hearted creature never breathed.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>I fear, my dear Mrs. Twisden, my visit has been unluckily timed—that it may
be inconvenient to you to receive me just now ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Not at all, my dear,—not at all; but I must confess that I was rather
surprised at seeing you; for I could not have supposed that your cross old
husband could ever have been prevailed upon to let you come to town by
yourself.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>It is no longer in his power to prevent my doing as I like.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Indeed !—separated ! I thought it would come to that.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>Eternally! I have been a widow nearly eighteen months.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Dead !—dead, is he ? <stage>(aside)</stage> And a very good thing, too.
<stage>( aloud)</stage> I always said something of that sort would happen, for I
was sure you couldn't <emph>live</emph> together. To speak the plain truth, he
was a most disagreeable man!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>My dear Mrs. Twisden !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Oh, my dear, you know that pretty well, I should think !—a
quarrelsome—malicious—mean—miserly —jealous—gouty old man !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>Mrs. Twisden!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Well, my dear, out of respect to your <emph>grief</emph>, I'll say no more;
but I could, a great deal more. Do you remember the day when you came to me to
protect you against his violence, because he found the portrait of a young man
in your hands ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>

<p>I have suffered much on the original's account. I was fondly attached to him,
when I was forced into a marriage with my late husband.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>And now, you mean to marry him?</p>

<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Then you are very wrong. I have told you, over and over again, that Henry
Fitzherbert is a dissipated young man of fashion ; and is that, let me ask you,
the sort of person likely to render a woman happy and comfortable in the married
state ? My dear, he'd make a deplorable husband ! As he happens to be my nephew,
you see I know some little about him. His family were most anxious to bring
about a marriage with him and his cousin Laura; but no, no, <emph>I</emph> had
such a <emph>good</emph> opinion of him, that I begged leave to decline the
honour; and, in case of accidents, as cousins are sometimes <emph>exceedingly
fond</emph> of each other, I have never allowed them to meet.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>Is it possible that they are not known to each other ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, no! After Laura's marriage, I didn't much care about it, and would
have invited him to the house; but Mr. Wyndham would not hear of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<p>But I think I have influence enough over him, to make him correct all his
little errors.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0157_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
<p>Oh! I've no doubt you think so—we shall see. Well, I'll find you his precious
picture, now that you can retain it with propriety ; in the mean time do you
retire to your own room, which shall be this— <stage>( pointing to room
L.H.)</stage> I will order up your things, and some refreshment, after your
journey—which, I'm sure, you must require.</p>
</sp>

handsomest fellow in the world : <emph>such</emph> a man is almost always
devoted to his wife. There are exceptions, I dare say; but he has found one to
love him. He fears, or is doubtful, whether he might succeed with another; he is
contented, and appreciates the treasure he has won ; and, for fear of losing the
prize, he redoubles his attentions daily.</p>

attention; in short, he is all self! Never thinks of such a thing as taking his
