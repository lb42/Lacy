       years passed out of the kingdom, for the purpose of meeting his vassals and servants— that
       they may have the honour and supreme delight of for an instant contemplating their legitimate

      <p> Travelling, pah ! that's the very groundwork of our gaiety, there we all sit in our nest,
       while I whistle some lively air, and they chorus it. Wherever we stop, we find light hearts
       and smiling faces to welcome us; at night, if the receipts have been good, we sup gaily, and
       thank Heaven for its bounty. When bad, we repine not; but look with confidence to Him, for
       that which He will bestow upon the morrow. </p>

       another, like a hand of cards, and in about a minute, they all sat squatting on the ground,
       gazing at me with astonishment; but, to tell you the truth, I was much more astonished than
       they were, to discover, for the first time in my life, that I possessed the strength of an

      <p> I'll not, wife; but I <hi>must</hi> uphold it. Chevalier, I am of no high-born rank, I own. My
       father, a good, respected man in trade, shared the fate of too many in the wild struggle of a
       people against their besotted rulers; he was no wild partizan on either side, content if he
       could live with honesty—a wild and savage enemy entered our small town, I saw that father,
       defending his own door, struck dead. My mother, flying with me, perished on a road-side bank;
       I called to her—she answered not, my child's strength yielding to my grief, I fell,
       slumbering, on that mother's corse; on waking, saw, to me, wild-looking people round; and,
       asking for my mother, they told me she was happy, and had gone to meet my father. They were
       travelling mountebanks, who having given her an humble grave, protected me; was this a
       crime in me or mine? </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ROL.</speaker>
      <p> No, certainly, it was charity. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BEL.</speaker>
      <p> The mountebanks' charity—they made me useful in their calling. Manhood came, I lodged some
       time at Chamont with Pierre Valin, her protector; at his last request, I named to her my
       love, to which she, in love, responded; we now have children, loving us as we love them—I
       knew not that she was rich. Now, tell me, Sir, if her family were placed upon the highest
       pinnacle of worldly pride, name or rank, what is there in act of mine, in what have I so
       disgraced her name, my name, that they should dare ask her to discard me? </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MAD.</speaker>
      <p> Sir, this family, of whom I know nothing, adopts him, or adopts not me. You may depart.

      <p> We are here, pa. </p>

      <p> Be speedy—prepare the things: we must fly the dresses, carpet—all in the chaise.

      <p> Now, to distribute this villain's gold, and against himself. <stage>(to GARCON)</stage>
       You have post-horses—you let them, do you not? </p>

      <p> Now, mark! I am agent for a high and powerful personage —he is travelling this road. Take
       these Louis; and, till he arrives here—it may not be for three days—retain all your horses,
       and those you can hire. Let them wait here in readiness. A heavy penalty falls on your
       master, if the Prince's orders be disobeyed. Serve him well. Here is for
       yourself.<stage>(gives him money.)</stage> </p>

      <p> Oh, it wasn't the haste to arrive—it was the haste to fly. <stage>(CATHERINE

      <p> I beg your pardon; you know I have a very great respect for you—and I am sure if you want

       in <hi>their</hi> love for him; in eating with a sweet relish the bread one has earned. You can say

      <p> Yes, but what sort of soup? Rich people, I'm afraid, make their soup very differently to

       lack of that aid I might procure but for my poverty! Oh, no, no! I cannot resign myself to
       that, without a mother's effort. A doctor resides in the lower part of this large house: he
       is, they tell me,—of great skill—the first in the city. I must—will—have his opinion on my

      <p> I know, I know.—<stage>(aside)</stage> She is right, but I must not neglect my
       promise.—<stage>(aloud)</stage> But you'll not deny that the rich, in comparison with the
       poor, have got much to aid them—happy partners, healthy children: or, if sickly by chance,
       they have the means of restoration in their hands. When grown up, they can leave them
       fortunes—marry them to friends, wealthy gentlemen. Now, you are a kind mother—love your

     <sp>

      <p> Rich! Oh, but what good would wealth be to me, if that which I possessed cankered my very

      <p> William, no, he is very careful of his secrets; but another;

      <p> Discovered! Oh! did my husband know this. CATH. 'Tis he who has spoken to me about you.

      <p> <stage>(to CATHERINE, C.)</stage> Leave us. <stage>(CATHERINE exits, L.H.)</stage> Madame
       you behold me here a second time to salute the heritress of one of the proudest names of
       France—the daughter of the Marquis de Montbazon. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MAD.</speaker>
      <p> Oh, leave me, if my husband should come. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ROL.</speaker>
      <p> Before I followed your steps, I wrote to the Duke, your grandfather, the joy that had
       entered his heart at your recovery, was in some part damped by your flight; but all is not
       quite lost, if you now consent to accompany me. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MAD.</speaker>
      <p> No, no, no! I cannot. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ROL.</speaker>
      <p> By the Duke's order—your nearest relative—the Count de Blangy, has arrived here to bear
       you to him—his carriage and people are not two paces from your door—with but one word of
       yours, the entire family are ready to embrace you, whom they have so long mourned lost, till
       by a miracle you were discovered; there is wealth for you, happiness. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MAD.</speaker>
      <p> And my husband? ROL. They assure you of their care of him. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MAD.</speaker>
      <p> But they repulse him. Would drive him from me—to exile—oh they will part us, and I shall
       never see him more. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ROL.</speaker>
      <p> You will forget him. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MAD.</speaker>
      <p> Forget—forget him—my husband—to whom hefore Heaven's Altar I pledged myself for happiness
       or misery—prosperity or adversity—I'll not violate that sacred oath, nor will I abandon
       him—you have my answer, and again I tell you, that whether I be Countess or Princess, that
       man is still my husband. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ROL.</speaker>
      <p> But the Marquis de Montbazon was your father, and you must renounce his name and memory,
       or this shameless vagabond. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MAD.</speaker>
      <p> Vagabond! he's my husband<stage>(scarcely able to restrain herself)</stage> By insulting
       the father of my children, you insult me. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ROL.</speaker>
      <p> Your family—expect—wait—call for you. </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MAD.</speaker>
      <p> They may, but, without my husband and my children, they must expect—wait—call in vain.
      </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ROL.</speaker>
      <p> Yet, think of your children, whom misery makes pale— who each hour sinks in the brute
       strength of a father, living by their agony of mind and tortured frames—who even now exposes
       them to the chance of death—who </p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MAD.</speaker>
      <p> It is too much! Heaven support me in this heavy trial— this sad heart test—<stage>(a loud
       noise is heard of the drum and trumpet; clapping of hands and murmurs; she runs to the window
       and looks out.)</stage> He is there—William! ah!<stage>(utters a cry)</stage> you will kill
       the child! <stage>(noise of distant bravoes.)</stage> No, no—he laughs at his peril. William
       receives him in his arms—he embraces him. Their eyes are raised to this window—to me—they
       waft their kisses hither—again—still, for ever, <hi>my</hi> love.—<stage>(as she motions her hand to
       them)</stage> You may retire, Sir. Your words made my heart waver for an instant—but 'tis
       again itself. I am Madeline, daughter of the workman. I am not the child of those great ones
       you name—who rememeber me only because they want a name to their race, and a drop added to
       their high blood.—Go!<stage>(with disgust and determination.)</stage> </p>

      <p> Oh, husband! you are wrong to speak thus, and you wrong me, still more so to speak so at

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BEL.</speaker>
      <p> Not in speech, but with the tear in your eye and heaving of your heart, that give pain

      <p> A bonnet won't do. She has nothing to wear with it but an old cloak and a villainous

      <p> Oh,'tis horrible! to place a mother between her duty to her husband and her child—between

       him—that 'tis not for long—that he must pardon—but I could not bear to see my child sink day
       by day, dying before my eyes, for that aid, which one word from me would procure, tell my
       husband that, and say that it shall not be for long; I leave him but to save his child.

    <stage>Grounds of a chateau near Bordeaux, in the possession of HERCULES DE MONTBAZON—A large
     tent fitted up, occupies the stage, opening at back C. </stage>
    <stage> Enter Duke DE MONTBAZON, as returning from the chase, attended by COURGEMONT, Judge
     D'ARPIGNOL, and GENTLEMEN. </stage>

     <speaker>COUR.</speaker>
     <p> Your nephew has chosen a most beautiful retreat. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
     <p> Yes, near the gates of Bourdeaux, but a little too distant from my villa of Craignon. I am
      glad the chase drew us on this side of the city, as it affords me an opportunity of testing
      how he proceeds with his studies; he is at present the sole heritor of the name and house of
      Montbazon, and I would see him worthy of such honour. <stage>Enter HERCULES, R.H. </stage>
     </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HER.</speaker>
     <p> Ah, my dear uncle—I'm quite rejoiced—you sent for me? </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
     <p> I did, I was somewhat surprised at your not meeting me at the gate. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HER.</speaker>
     <p> Oh, really—excuse me, but I was deeply in my studies, engaged with my professor. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
     <p> Your professor—of what ? </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HER.</speaker>
     <p> Of—of—I hope he does not suspect it was Flora. <stage>(aside.)</stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
     <p> Your professor of philosophy, I dare say. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HER.</speaker>
     <p> Yes—yes, uncle, of philosophy. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
     <p> I should like to see the man. </p>

     <p> The man! </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
     <p> It is a man, I suppose? </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HER.</speaker>
     <p> Oh, yes. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
     <p> Go and request the professor to come to me, or any person you find in my nephew's

     <p> Go. </p>

     <speaker>HER.</speaker>
     <p> But, my dear uncle, he's such a queer old fish, and she— that is he—he's as deaf as a
      beetle, added to which his physiognomy is absolutely horrid. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p> Of grace, uncle, of grace.<stage>(pirouettes.)</stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
     <p> Mademoiselle, you are a very pretty girl. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FLORA.</speaker>
     <p> You are not the first who has informed me of the fact. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
     <p> And now tell me, what are your views towards my nephew.<stage>(aside to her.)</stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FLORA.</speaker>
     <p> Really, sport, Monsieur, and nothing more; my own residence is close at hand. I met your
      nephew some weeks back with a silly, antiquated, and pride-starched aunt; they had no horses,
      so I brought him here in my carriage to teaze her. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
     <p> For no other purpose? </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FLORA.</speaker>
     <p> Oh, if you think so, you are very much deceived; for though but a dancer, as that gentleman
      observes, I have too much care for myself than to play the fool with such a fool as your
      nephew, believe me. Good day, most noble Duke De Montbazon. <stage>Exit R. </stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
     <p> This girl has sense. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JUDGE.</speaker>
     <p> Sense—that's the word. <stage>Enter DE BLANGY, C. </stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLAN.</speaker>
     <p> Madeline has arrived, and I have, according to Rollac's orders, had her conducted to your
      villa at Craignon. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
     <p> Poor girl! You hear, Hercules, this newly-found lady is the daughter of my son, who died in
      Germany, and is your cousin. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HER.</speaker>
     <p> Oh, yes, I know—the wife of a juggler! an uncommonly odd affair. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
     <p> However odd, 'tis true. You, therefore, through her, lose your claim and inheritance to my
      name and estates—be therefore, careful that my purse continues open to you. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HER.</speaker>
     <p> I'll be uncommonly careful, uncle. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(to BLANGY)</stage> But where is the Chevalier Rollac? </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLAN.</speaker>
     <p> I heard from him at Chantillac, where the state of Madeline and her child compelled us to
      stay for some time. He then stated that he had been compelled to remain at Angouleme, to watch
      this Belphégor. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
     <p> And by which, I trust, he rids us altogether of this man. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLAN.</speaker>
     <p> That is his purpose. He has thrown upon him the suspicions of the Prefect of the Gironde,
      and also of Charente—by which he is chased from each post or place of his attempted stay. The
      Chevalier is in great hopes that the fellow will be forced by misery to accept our offers. By
      his last letters, I fancy he will arrive here to-day, and give his own news of his success.
     </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
     <p> ' T i s well. You'll go to Craignon. Console Madelinetell her that I am prevented this
      day from embracing her. 
      <pb n="28"/> Tomorrow, the Count d'Artois will be in Bordeaux, and I shall myself personally
      entreat his favour and power to quit us of this Belphegor. Hercules, adieu. Remember you are
      now without patrimony, and, if you wish continuance of my favour and protection, respect your
      cousin Madeline. Now, gentlemen, to horse.<stage> They exit C. </stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HER.</speaker>
     <p> Pleasant, to be robbed of one's rights by the wife of a mountebank, upon my word.
      <stage>Re-enter FLORA, R.</stage> </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FLORA.</speaker>
     <p> Ha, ha, ha! what a nice, fine old gentleman your uncle is, Hercules! </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HER.</speaker>
     <p> Umph, yes, tolerable in his way, but I wish he'd keep out of mine; but now about our
      bal-masque, have you given all the invitations? </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FLORA.</speaker>
     <p> Yes, and a charming affair it will be, the handsomest men in all Bourdeaux. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HER.</speaker>
     <p> Now, that's personal, a positive personal remark. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FLORA.</speaker>
     <p> Personal, how so? I did not mean you—come, I see our friends arriving—lets go and receive
      them. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HER.</speaker>
     <p> But about the handsome men? </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FLORA.</speaker>
     <p> Come along. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HER.</speaker>
     <p> I don't like handsome men. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FLORA.</speaker>
     <p> That accounts for your being so much in love with yourself. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HER.</speaker>
     <p> That's doubly personal. <stage>Enter BEAUMESNIL as Harlequin, very fat, DUPERON as

     <p> Why, bless me<stage>(laughs)</stage>, how uncommon odd. It's a mountebank—a real

      BEAU. From Paris direct, I dare say—ha, ha! B E L . I've worn it long, Messieurs, and the late
      journey, the heavy roads we have travelled, the rain, mud, dust, has not improved its

     <p> I come far from this; there were three of us when we quitted Angouleme for Bordeaux, in
      search of one I hoped to find there,—and I started for Bordeaux, with my boy and horse Mouton;
      but, on our second day's journey, I found my poor horse was carrying beyond his strength, so I
      dismounted, and led him on by the bridle; but at the town, where we stopped to rest for the
      night, the Mayor said, he had heard this and that about us, and they chased us thence; we
      again travelled all night, I talking to my poor Mouton, who knew and understood my trouble ;
      when day dawned, as with a sudden stroke, he stopped, looking on me, as if he had said—" you
      see, master, I can go no further; " but my boy was cold, and I was obliged to travel on—poor
      Mouton, his strength was gone—he trembled—fell—I ran to him, his limbs shivered, his eyes
      glazed, and then—and then—my poor horse was dead.<stage>(all laugh and clap their
      hands)</stage>.} My boy and myself then took the road afoot, and now, alas! he is faint, tired
      and heart-sick. </p>

      accomplice. I was enabled on my arrival at Bordeaux, to communicate with her, and from her I
      learnt that my husband had been subjected to the cruel persecutions of this man, and in the
      lowest, most abject state of misery and distress, enforced to fly. Oh, Duke, had you
      instructed him to separate us from each other, you would not, I am sure, cruelly and wantonly
      have given orders that would inflict severest suffering on him—my husband—and my poor boy.

      peeping from a silk-curtained window, " Ah," cried he, " 'tis my Jeanne, my loved one." He

    <p> You'll love him as you love my—your pretty Jeanne. </p></sp> <sp><speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
    <p> He shall be my son, as Jeanne is my daughter. </p></sp> <sp><speaker>BEL.</speaker>
    <p> I believe you<stage>(takes the DUKE apart)</stage>. You can now, Monsieur, break my
    marriage, you shall never see me more. I bear myself away, where you will—'tis the same to me—to
    Cayenne, as this pardon insists. I will swear, in my turn, never to behold my wife or children
    again<stage>(struggling with his feelings)</stage>—pardon these tears; but I am still a man,
    though a despised one. Suffer me to embrace them <stage>(with choked utterance)</stage> for the
    last time—adieu, Henri, adieu—when you are happy, sometimes think of me, Jeanne<stage> (embraces
    her).</stage> Farewell, Madeline! pardon what you have suffered for me, it is my misery, not
    my sin, that I am poor—I loved you—shall love you ever—adieu! </p></sp>
    <sp><speaker>MAD.</speaker>
    <p> No—no, I will not part with you, I will not suffer you to depart alone, where you go, so do
    I.<stage>(goes up C. to him)</stage> </p></sp> <sp><speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
    <p> What means this? </p></sp> <sp><speaker>MAD.</speaker>
    <p> It means, Duke, that I am not alone a mother—I am a wife. By your protection my children may
    be led to happiness and honour; but from him, my husband<stage>(goes to him)</stage> I part not.

    <p><stage>(running to them—dragging his sister L.C.)</stage> Father—mother, do not leave us, if
    you go, pray—pray, take us with you? </p></sp> <sp><speaker>MAD.</speaker>
    <p> My children! </p></sp> <sp><speaker>BEL.</speaker>
    <p> Ah ! you see, Duke—we cannot part, you see. </p></sp> <sp><speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
    <p> <stage>(R.H., embraces Children)</stage> Oh, childhood! thy voice pleads strongly: and,
    casting pride aside, I yield to its holy impulse. The trial has been severe, but your mutual
    love will be the dearer for its tested faith. Belphégor, it was to save thy life I forced denial
    of thee from her lips. I shall now be alone. I would have saved our house's honours in our
    house's blood—therefore, sought thy child— </p></sp> <sp><speaker>BEL.</speaker>
    <p> Duke—when a mother's reason, when her heart, can bear the parting, they shall be rendered to
    you. Madeline, you'll bring your mind to bear their loss. </p></sp> <sp><speaker>MAD.</speaker>
    <p> Yes, in time—their loss, not yours.<stage>(embracing.)</stage> <stage>COURGEMENT and the
    rest re-enter. </stage> </p></sp> <sp><speaker>COUR.</speaker>
    <p> Duke, the Court awaits you. </p></sp> <sp><speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
    <p> It is useless—this man is pardoned. </p></sp> <sp><speaker>COUR.</speaker>
    <p> Lavarennes pardoned! <stage>ROLLAC enters, L. 3 E. </stage> </p></sp>
    <sp><speaker>ROL.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, oh! I am happy to hear it—Lavarennes pardoned! Monsieur, I'll thank you for my passport
    to Portugal.<stage>(taking off his wig and false whiskers.)</stage>
