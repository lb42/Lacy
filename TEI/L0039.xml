      <p> I'll not, wife; but I <hi>must</hi> uphold it. Chevalier, I am of no high-born rank, I
       own. My father, a good, respected man in trade, shared the fate of too many in the wild

       content if he could live with honesty—a wild and savage enemy entered our small town, I saw
       that father, defending his own door, struck dead. My mother, flying with me, perished on a
       road-side bank; I called to her—she answered not, my child's strength yielding to my grief, I
       fell, slumbering, on that mother's corse; on waking, saw, to me, wild-looking people round;
       and, asking for my mother, they told me she was happy, and had gone to meet my father. They
       were travelling mountebanks, who having given her an humble grave, protected me; was this a
       crime in me or mine? </p>

      <speaker>Bel.</speaker>
      <p> The mountebanks' charity—they made me useful in their calling. Manhood came, I lodged some
       time at Chamont with Pierre Valin, her protector; at his last request, I named to her my
       love, to which she, in love, responded; we now have children, loving us as we love them—I
       knew not that she was rich. Now, tell me, Sir, if her family were placed upon the highest
       pinnacle of worldly pride, name or rank, what is there in act of mine, in what have I so

     <p> I heard from him at Chantillac, where the state of Madeline and her child compelled us to

     <speaker>Blan.</speaker>
     <p> That is his purpose. He has thrown upon him the suspicions of the Prefect of the Gironde,
      and also of Charente—by which he is chased from each post or place of his attempted stay. The
      Chevalier is in great hopes that the fellow will be forced by misery to accept our offers. By
      his last letters, I fancy he will arrive here to-day, and give his own news of his success.

     <p> I come far from this; there were three of us when we quitted Angouleme for Bordeaux, in
      search of one I hoped to find there,—and I started for Bordeaux, with my boy and horse Mouton;
      but, on our second day's journey, I found my poor horse was carrying beyond his strength, so I
      dismounted, and led him on by the bridle; but at the town, where we stopped to rest for the
      night, the Mayor said, he had heard this and that about us, and they chased us thence; we
      again travelled all night, I talking to my poor Mouton, who knew and understood my trouble ;
      when day dawned, as with a sudden stroke, he stopped, looking on me, as if he had said—" you
      see, master, I can go no further; " but my boy was cold, and I was obliged to travel on—poor
      Mouton, his strength was gone—he trembled—fell—I ran to him, his limbs shivered, his eyes
      glazed, and then—and then—my poor horse was dead.<stage>(all laugh and clap their
