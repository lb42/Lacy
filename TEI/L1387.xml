  above it an oval mirror; door, R. 2 E.; door, L. 2 E.; L. 1 E., a fire-place, fire out; a window,
  hidden by large silken curtains, C. ; fauteuil and table, R. C.; lighted lamps—two upon the
  chimney-piece, one upon the table.</stage><stage>Mrs. Montgomery is discovered seated in easy chair,

  head.</stage>
  <sp> <speaker>Mrs. Montgomery.</speaker> <p>No ; go away! Susan! Su— <stage>(awaking)</stage> Ah! Goodness ! What a
  dream!—I have been asleep —I see how it was. Wearied out, I—I fell asleep before having called
  Susan, <stage>(rising)</stage> I must ring for her at once., <stage>(looking at clock on chimney piece)</stage> Four o’clock!
  Impossible! Four o’clock! and my ball terminated at one! What! 1 have slept three hours in that
  chair—and, only imagine—such a dream as I have had! That I should dream of Mr. Spitely—my opposite
  neighbour—he asked me to become his wife, and I refused. I did not dream that, for that was a
  reality which occurred some days ago! And only yesterday he wrote threatening to compromise me;
  and, at all hazards, to prevent my marriage with Augustus! Horrid man! He persecutes me and
  pursues me everywhere, even in my dreams! The very thought of it—but I must ring for Susan. <stage>(dugs
  bell beside fire-place)</stage> Poor girl! she has no doubt been here, and seeing me asleep, was afraid to
  awaken me. <stage>(listening)</stage> Not a soul—neither her nor Joseph ! They have followed my example, no
  doubt, and have fallen asleep in the ante­chamber. I will go and arouse them, and send them off at
  once to their rooms! <stage>(she takes lamp from table and goes off, door, L., leaving stage still
  lighted by lamps on chimney-piece after a moment, a loud snore is heard behind the window
  curtains)</stage>—</p><pb n="4"/></sp><sp>
  <speaker>FITZHOWARD.</speaker>
  <p> Who's that snoring in such a dreadful manner ? <stage>(he partly opens the window curtains, and is
     seen in a ball dress, and huddled in an easy chair)</stage> Nobody here! It must have been me! it’s
     just like me; I sleep so tumultuously that I awake myself! <stage>(rising and coming forward)</stage> The fact
     is that I needed those few moments of gentle repose! Yesterday evening, I left the small but
     highly respectable town of Dunsford—<stage>(stopping)</stage> May I venture to recite this to myself? Yes;
     everybody is in the ball room, dancing, and playing whist, and—well—<stage>(resuming)</stage> Yesterday
     evening, I left the small but highly respectable town of Dunsford, and arrived this morning in
     London, having travelled all night by railway. I took a cab from the station, and was driven to
     the residence of my nephew, number twenty-four, Tight Street. I tendered the cabman sixpence,
     which he indignantly—and with anything but classical language—declined to accept. His fare, he
     said, was half-a-crown. It might have been; I am not well up in it — and my nephew, he happened
     to be from home for a day and a night. This evening, I dined alone—and still at table—the
     dessert before me—one orange, two apples, and five nuts— when all at once, my old friend
     Buncombe walks in. “ Will you spend the evening with me," says he. " With great pleasure," says
     I. “ Then,” says he, " put on your dress coat and patent boots, and I will take you to a ball.”
     I take leave to inform Buncombe that I didn't come to London to dance; but he informs me that I
     shall meet at that ball a person—an important functionary—a chairman of our railway—of whom I
     have great need. So at ten o'clock we arrive at Mrs. Montgomery’s—a young widow—with whom I
     have no acquaintance. Being a widower myself, I am very partial to widows. To be a conqueror in
     that struggle till death, which is called marriage, proves a certain superiority. Buncombe
     presents me, and then we push through the crowd in search of my chairman. I get a great many
     digs in the ribs from a great many elbows, : and I dig a few myself. After about a quarter of
     an hour Of this liberal exchange, Buncombe says to me, “Your chairman can't have arrived yet; I
     shall go and have a game at whist. Do you go and pay your court to the mistress of the house.”
     Then I say, “Yes,” and I don’t go—for two reasons—the first, that I don’t like talking with
     women; it—always reminds me of the dear wife I have lost, who talked  great deal too much, and
     generally in a very loud voice; the second, that having been all night on the railway, I was
     tired. So, what did I do? I stole—no, slipped—pooh! I am alone. I stole into this boudoir; and
     here I have had a few minutes' sleep—-my chairman hadn’t arrived; and I hope now that i he
     isn’t gone. Some chairmen can’t rest two minutes in the
     <pb n="5"/> same place. I must put on my gloves again, and re-arrange my cravat, <stage>(places
     himself before looking glass, R.)</stage>— </p>
  <stage>Enter Mrs. Montgomery, door
  c.</stage></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(aside)</stage> Nobody ! They have not waited, it seems, for my orders to retire.
  Thought, no doubt, that I had for­gotten them, <stage>(seeing FITZHOWARD)</stage> Ah! some one here
  ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(aside)</stage> Oh ! the  mistress of—</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Sir—who are
  you?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Fitzhoward—Alexander Fitzhoward. <stage>(gallantly taking the lamp from her hand
  and placing it on table, r. c.)</stage> Allow me, madam—introduced this evening by Buncombe—you know
  Buncombe—the man with the big nose.—.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(l. c.)</stage> But, sir, the ball is
  over.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Already, you are joking?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Joking! It is four o'clock in
  the morning!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Four o'clock! <stage>(hastily looking at his watch)</stage> So it is! twenty
   minutes past four. I have been put right by the Horse Guards.</p><pb n="6"/></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>
  I’ll go and knock them up. I don’t mean the doors— the others. You know ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>You
  would not think of such a thing ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Servants are made to be knocked up. They don’t
  mind if they are paid, and I’ll give them a shilling amongst them. How many are they?—not above
  seven or eight, I daresay.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>It is impossible, sir! What would be said, should
  you be seen leaving my house, and three hours after every one else is gone ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>
  Well, but excuse me, you don’t intend to make me stop here, do you ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Oh,
  sir!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Then, madam, let us go to work systematically. The only way to leave a
  house, is by the door.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(timidly)</stage> Or—<stage>(crossing and pointing to it)</stage> Or by the
  window.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p><stage>(r. c.)</stage> Yes, when we happen to be on the ground floor; but this is the
  second story.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(l. c.)</stage> The first, sir—the ground floor only is beneath
  us.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Well, the ground floor, that’s one, and this is two— the second story of
  course!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Sir—you are a gentleman ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Me? Oh, dear, no—I’m a
  churchwarden.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>You would not wish to render a lady the victim of a situation
  which you yourself have created—</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>I?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>By falling asleep
  ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>That's true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>You cannot, then, refuse me. <stage>(pointing to
  window)</stage></p><p>Try—</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>To jump out of window ? Excuse me, madam, but there are
  certain things which no one has the right to propose to a merchant, and especially a churchwarden,
  who is verging on fifty—to confess the truth, has actually passed it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(still
  entreating)</stage> Sir, my honour is in question, you have compromised me—</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(hesitating)</stage>
  I’m very sorry; and if we were on the ground floor certainly, I—I would jump—as a brave man, I
  would take the daring step!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(taking his hand and drawing him towards window)</stage> I
  entreat you—the night is dark, the street deserted.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>But are you asphalted ? <stage>(they have reached the window, Mrs. Montgomery half opens the curtains
     and drops them again immediately)</stage></p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(frightened, and thrusting Fitzhoward from her)</stage> Ah!
   Withdraw!</p><pb n="7"/> </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker> <p><stage>(running and hiding behind door, L.)</stage> Eh—what
  ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(in a low tone)</stage> There is a light at the window opposite.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p>
  <stage>(behind door)</stage> Tell ’em to put it out and go to bed— ought to be ashamed to keep such dreadful
  hours 1</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Wretched spy !</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>You don’t mean me, I hope
  ?</p><p>Mrs M. No, no; a man who has sworn to destroy me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>The murdering,
  thief ! I hope he hasn’t taken any oath on my account.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>He must not see
  you!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(advancing)</stage> So much the better, then I shan’t have to jump from the
   window—I’m out of that, <stage>(sits on couch)</stage></p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(after a pause, C.)</stage> Ah, we are saved
  !</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(shocked)</stage> What! till to-morrow morning, oh! <stage>(jumps up and runs behind the
  couch)</stage></p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>I mean till daybreak; at seven o’clock the servants will open the
  doors, and you may then leave unobserved.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(advancing towards her)</stage> Quite
  impossible!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Oh, sir—for the sake of my happiness! for it is necessary I should
  tell you all, I am on the point of entering into a second marriage with one whom I love—and—I have
  my reputation to preserve.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Well—and haven’t I got my reputation to
  preserve?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(smiling)</stage> Oh! a man’s reputation.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Yes, some
  men—but, I am a different sort of man— I am a highly moral man—I have reached, madam, the age of
  fifty-three, and am as innocent as a lamb!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(gently taking his hat from him)</stage> Do
  not refuse me. <stage>(indicating easy chair near fire-place)</stage> Seat yourself there. Besides, it is all
  your fault, you had no business to go to sleep in my boudoir.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(yielding,
  crossing over, and sitting, K)</stage> You are settling it very nicely. If you had passed the night on a
  railway, with a fellow sitting opposite to you who kept on stretching out his long legs and
  kicking all the bark off your shins. </p></sp>
   <sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(r. c.)</stage> What a pity that the fire has
  gone out!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(seated, L.)</stage> A good example—I wish I could follow it.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p> You will be quite comfortable there! — </p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Shall I? I should prefer a feather bed though, for all that.</p></sp>
   <sp><speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker><p><stage>(getting a cushion from the couch and placing it <pb n="8"/> behind FitzHoward’s back)</stage> See, sir—let me place this cushion so —  at your
   back.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>That’s a little better.</p>
   </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p> <stage>(bringing a stool from before the easy chair near table)</stage> And this stool for your
   feet.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>I am sure you are very good, but—<stage>(settling himself in the chair)</stage> for all that. I was a
   confounded fool to come to your ball.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>I am very sorry, I am sure—quite in despair.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>You don’t feel so miserable as I do, I know, <stage>(closes his eyes and turns round in
   chair)</stage></p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>The glare of those lamps, perhaps? <stage>(lowers the two lamps on the chimney-piece)</stage>
   There, that's better, is it not ?</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p><stage>(huddling himself in chair)</stage> Nothing’s better—it’s all worse.—.—.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(goes to table, R. C., and busies herself with her  jewel casket—a pause)</stage> You have not been in
     London, till now, for a long time ?</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(all of a heap, his eyes closed)</stage> No.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Do you like our city?</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(louder)</stage> No.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Your home is in the country, I believe?</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(slewing himself round, and opening his eyes)</stage> Excuse me, ma’am, are you like all the
   rest of your sex—must you talk or die ?</p>
 </sp><sp><speaker> Mrs. M. </speaker><p>Oh, no, sir, only I thought I might amuse you.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Let me alone and I’ll amuse myself—I’ll go to sleep.—_</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Oh, sir, if you wish it——.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Retire to your own room, put on your nightcap, and go to bed.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Oh, sir!</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>You needn’t mind me—bolt your door—I'm a moral churchwarden — aged fifty-three,
   <stage>(shutting his eyes)</stage>  Good night.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Good night, sir. <stage>(looking at him)</stage> Yes, the  best thing I can do is to let him sleep,
   <stage>(places herself before glass, R., and withdraws successively several pins from her hair - about
   to take off her wreath, finds that is still held)</stage>  Why it is not yet free!—,</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Pray don’t keep on tit-tit tap-tap—I can’t bear it; <stage>(slewing himself round towards
   her)</stage> Shall I come and help you?</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Pray do not disturb yourself. I am removing my head-dress—but there are so many
   pins——.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(rising, going to her, and looking for the pin)</stage>  Yes I know a parcel of women with as
   many pins in their head as <pb n="9"/> they have got hairs on it. When I say a parcel of women- you will understand
  I don't mean you. <stage>(taking off tho wreath)</stage> There!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Thank you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>
   While I am about it, shall I unhook you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Sir!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p> <stage>(with
  indifference)</stage> Oh, I merely offered—I’d rather not have the trouble, I tell you. <stage>(beats up his
  cushion and re-seats himself in easy chair)</stage></p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(taking up her jewel caskets and
  crown of flowers and lamp from table)</stage> Now 1 will leave you. Good night, sir.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>
  Yes, go along—good night—bolt your door.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(aside)</stage> Why does he tell me that!
  <stage>(aloud)</stage> I will rouse you at seven o'clock.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Perhaps I shall disturb you before
  then.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(surprised—aside)</stage> Eh! It is really very strange. I have a presentiment
  that—I suspect some mystery, and am almost afraid—but I will say nothing now, and to-morrow—
  <stage>(aloud)</stage> Good night, sir.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Bolt the door. <stage>(Mrs. MONTGOMERY goes off door R.)</stage> And
  this is what comes after the party. I hope she don't mean to bother me any more, <stage>(rising)</stage> I'll
  bolt the door my­self. <stage>(goes to door, r.)</stage> Ah! of course, no bolt on this side at all—and I have
  never clapt eyes on my chairman—shall be obliged to-go back home without having seen him—for what
  brings me to London, <stage>(confidentially)</stage> This is between ourselves, 1 have told nobody but Buncombe,
  <stage>(pulls a staring cotton handkerchief from his pocket and ties it round his head)</stage> I am seeking to
  obtain authority to take the name of Fitzhoward— Alexander Fitzhoward—not that my real name is at
  all ridiculous, far from it. <stage>(looking around)</stage> There is nobody about, so-my real name is—it was
  originally a Russian name, I believe—is—Mizzleandcutof— yes, it's a Russian name, there's so doubt
  about that. Yes—promise you won't say a word—but Alexander Mizzleandcutoff, that's my real name.
  But my nephew don't like it—wants to change it—he's about to mix up in some financial matters,
  going to start a bank, I believe, and he says that Mizzleandcutof wouldn't do. I don't see that
  myself—I should think Mizzleandcutoff would do—but, I wrote to him," Renounce your marriage and I
  will change my name.” <stage>(arranging cushion, die., and again curling himself in chair)</stage> For he wants
  to get married—but I wouldn't hear of it—a London woman in my family?—never! <stage>(closing his eyes)</stage> He
  must marry a girl from the country! <stage>(closes his eyes, re-opens them after a moment and places his
  hands on his stomach)</stage> Oh! I’ve got the cramp in my stomach! <stage>(jumping up)</stage> I’m seriously ill— I
  can’t help it—I’m very sorry, but Mrs. Montgomery must <pb n="10"/> run for a doctor. Ah! I know now
  what it is, I’m hungry !— while the others were having supper, I was asleep I <stage>(taking lamp from
  mantel-piece)</stage> I must go and see if I can't find some­thing, if it’s only a turkey or so; a good
  strong application of that sort of would soon cure my complaint I</p><p>Goes off on tiptoe,
  door L.—as he is going out Mrs. MONTGOMERY half opens door, R., and watches him)</p><p>Mrs
  M. <stage>(troubled)</stage> Where is he going ? Certainly there is something extraordinary in all this, just now
  he feigned to be fast asleep—insisted that I should go to my room—and now he is marching about the
  house ! The indifference that he affected while removing my wreath, and in his proposition to
  unhook me, and bis talk of his fifty-three years—all that is not natural! Have I fallen into a
  trap ? If he should be that wretch, Spitely! I do not know him—have but once, and scarcely,
  perceived him at his window—he appeared to me to be younger, but who shall say that be has not
  disguised himself in order that he might present himself here before me? People do not fall asleep

  <stage>(perceiving her in the glass turns quickly towards her)</stage> You, madam? you here? I thought you were

  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Suppose for a moment that I am not fifty-three.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(quickly)</stage> You confess it?</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>No, I don’t confess, I suppose—unfortunately I can only suppose—that’s all.
   <stage>(drinks)</stage></p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(aside)</stage> Oh! I will compel him to betray himself.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>And behold us together at five o’clock in the morning. <stage>(looking at his watch)</stage> That’s
   the time—I’m right by the Horse Guards—you are seated beside me with no mistrust.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(aside)</stage> Oh, indeed! <stage>(aloud)</stage> Do you know, sir, what it is that renders women strong
   ?</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>I have heard say that it’s what’s called calisthenics and gymnastics.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(boldly)</stage> It is their seeming weakness—they are not mistrusted—they advance boldly,
   and so they often triumph.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>I don’t understand what you are talking about.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Shall I give you an example ?</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Yes, talk away now. I’ll listen to you while I’m eating —or rather, no—I’ll eat while
   I’m listening to you.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>It is the history of what happened to a friend of mine—she was young.—</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Like you.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>A widow——</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Like you.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>And, like me, on the point of contracting a second marriage.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>It is only for that purpose that women become widows. </p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>One evening, ’twas in the country, she was alone, when she received a visit from a
   gentleman of respectable appearance, of about fifty-two or fifty-three years of age-—</p>
  <p>Fitz . Like me in every particular.</p>
  <p>Mrs. NI. Like you : he said he was a merchant.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>And a churchwarden, perhaps— .—,</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Perhaps so. The hours sped on, night had arrived, 
 <pb n="12"/>  and my friend felt compelled to ask this gentleman to stay dinner. Behold them,
   then, at table.</p>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p><stage>(eating)</stage> Like us.</p><p>MRs.M. <stage>(rising slowly and observing FITZHOWARD)</stage>
  By certain signs—by the lightness of his manner—the vivacity of hies eyes— my friend perceived
  that her guest was a young man disguised.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Bravo! <stage>(greatly delighted)</stage> I guess the
  denouement!— the elderly gentleman took off his wig, and threw it at the  lady's feet, <stage>(dashes his
  napkin on the tablet and is about to rise Mrs. Montgomery extends her hand to stop
  him)</stage></p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>No.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(calmly)</stage> Ah! what then! <stage>(taking his
  glass)</stage></p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(pointedly)</stage> He had not time; <stage>(pointing to his glass)</stage> for in the wine
  that he had drank, the lady had poured a deadly poison.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(rising quickly)</stage> Poison
  ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(aside)</stage> It is he. <stage>(aloud)</stage> No, sir, have no fear; but  <stage>(severely)</stage> do you
  think, really, that your conduct is that of a gentleman ?—-</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(confused)</stage> Well, I—I
  found the partridge on the side- board—-and I was hungry—and—</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>I have refused
  you my hand. Is it my fault that I love another? Is that a reason why you should destroy me in the
  eyes of the world ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>I ? I’ll take my solemn oath——</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>This
  disguise is useless. Your name is not Fitzhoward.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(aside)</stage> Eh!—she knows !
  <stage>(aloud, greatly troubled)</stage> It is true, madam. That—that name—</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Take off that
  wig.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(stunned)</stage> Eh?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Do not tell me again that you are
  fifty-three years of age, Mr. Spitely.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Who's Mr. Spitely—me?</p><p>Mrs. M.
  Undoubtedly.—.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>It’s a mistake—a decided mistake. Certainly I am
  fifty-three—there’s no mistake there, unfortunately; and I have worn a wig for the last ten years,
  unfortunately.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(confused)</stage> Then I have been deceived.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Very
  likely.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>I beg your pardon; but I was so troubled that I was really so stupid
  as to mistake you for a young man.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>A very natural mistake, I flatter
  myself.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(graciously)</stage> Pray resume your supper.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(crosses  l.)</stage>
  Thank you—my appetite is gone.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(offering him a glass of wine and smiling)</stage> Fear
   nothing; I am not a Lucretia Borgia.</p><pb n="13"/></sp><sp><speaker> Fitz. </speaker><p>Then I’m not dead? Well, that is
  one comfort; but I am not thirsty now, thank you—that interesting history of
  yours—</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p> <stage>(r. c., placing glass on table)</stage> Oh! a mere fancy
  sketch.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Never mind—it wasn’t good seasoning with my part­ridge, and I don’t feel
  comfortable at all. <stage>(sits in easy chair near fireplace)</stage></p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Mercy on me!—you are
  ill!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Salts!—vinegar! Something—anything—everything!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Yes—yes.
  A moment—only a moment.</p><p>Hurries off, door R.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>I shall be laid up —and
  perhaps I shall be laid out— and they call this going out into society! <stage>(rising)</stage> I believe a
  little fresh air would do me good; I can’t breathe here, <stage>(opens the window)</stage> Not daylight yet.
  <stage>(noise as of an opposite window being thrown violently open)</stage></p><p>Voice.
  Sir!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(hastily retreating and letting the curtains fall)</stage> Oh I— the fellow over
  the way. <stage>(in a low tone)</stage> I suppose he never goes to bed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Voice.</speaker><p>You shall account to
  me for your conduct.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Means to challenge me, no doubt.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Voice.</speaker><p>No use
  to conceal yourself. I know you, Mr. Mizzleandcutoff.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(greatly surprised)</stage> My
  name!—he knows my name!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Voice.</speaker><p>I shall be with you at ten in the morning—number
   twenty-four, Tight Street.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>My address! <stage>(rushing to the window)</stage> But, sir—
  </p></sp><sp><speaker>Voice.</speaker><p>Good night, <stage>(the window is heard to close)</stage></p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Stop—excuse
  me—</p><stage>Enter Mrs. Montgomery, door R., a flagon in her hand.</stage></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Here,
  sir. What do I see ? That window open ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p> Excuse me—I wanted some
  oxygen.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(frightened)</stage> And Mr. Spitely has seen you ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>It’s
  very strange—that fellow knows me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Knows you ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Knows my
  address, number twenty-four, Tight Street.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(greatly astonished)</stage> How? You reside—</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz. </speaker><p>At number twenty-four, Tight Street, with my nephew, Augustus
  Mizzleandcutoff— Fitzhoward.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(aside)</stage> Augustus ! Uncle !</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>
  Where has he seen me ? How did he know me ? I; haven’t been in London before, for twenty-three
  years!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker> <p><stage>(aside)</stage> He has mistaken him for his nephew.<pb n="14"/>
  <stage>(aloud)</stage> It is very simple—that gentleman was no doubt here this evening in the crowd—heard you
  named, and now would provoke you to—</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(quickly)</stage> Oh! don’t be afraid, I know what
  I am about; I shan’t fight with him, I shall apologize.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Apologize ! what for
  ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>I don’t know, but I shall apologise.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>And to-morrow I shall
  be the talk of the whole town—my marriage will be broken off, and it is you who— <stage>(pretending great
  distress)</stage> Oh, sir! why did you open that window ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Because I couldn’t do without
  a fresh supply of oxygen and carbon.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>What do you think will become of me
  ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(aside)</stage> She’s going to cry !</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>When the future lay before me
  so sweet and smiling—ah! I am lost! I have now only to die!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Allow me,
  madam—</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Oh ! I know what you are going to do! You are about to propose to marry
  me!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>I ? decidedly not I “ None wed the second, but who killed the first,” as
  Shakspeare says. I have taken a widower to remain a vow. <stage>(collecting himself)</stage> No ; I mean a vow to
  remain a——</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>And yet, sir, if I insisted—</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Couldn’t do it,
  impossible! I should make you miserable. Sometimes my temper is awful!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>But
  then you have a son, of course ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Of course I haven’t, heaven has refused me that
  blessing, up to the present moment. I have no beloved son who is legitimately anxious to inherit
  my money and effects; and as I am a widower, it would be very improper if—</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>You
  have perhaps a brother ?—a nephew ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>A nephew ? Yes, I have a
  nephew.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Then it is for him to repair the wrong which you have inflicted on my
  honour.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Well, he wishes to get married.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Oh!
  indeed?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>And I have opposed it. The best way to prevent him marrying his London
  lady, would be to compel him to marry you—it will be a good joke to play him.</p><p>Mrs. M.
  A joke!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>No, no—I mean, a good lark—he shall marry you.</p><p>Mrs. M.
  <stage>(aside)</stage> He is coming to it. <stage>(aloud)</stage> But should he refuse ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Then I’ll cut him off
  with nothing. Besides, why should he refuse? He is an elegant young man—so are
  you</p><pb n="15"/> </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker><p> Sir!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>I mean, you
  are young.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Twenty-two.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Not bad-looking, rich—for you must be
  rich or—- </p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Twenty thousand pounds.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Twenty thousand!
  Charming—you, I mean—yes, you are charming, <stage>(aside)</stage> Twenty thousand pounds! <stage>(aloud)</stage> But let us
  see. Yes, I don’t see why, since it is I who have compromised you—<stage>(aside)</stage> Twenty thousand!—<stage>(aloud)</stage>
  I don’t see why I should force my poor nephew to marry you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Eh
  ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> Considering that I am here —for I am here.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p> You
  !—</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Certainly. I have committed the fault, it is for me to repair
  it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>But, sir, allow me.—'</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Not another word—I’ll marry you.
  Twenty thousand—</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Eh ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Twenty thousand times rather
  than—</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>But I refuse. With respect to your nephew.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>My nephew,
  my nephew. I have deceived you—he is tremendously ugly—frightful!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(aside)</stage> The
  wicked story-teller!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>He is three years older than I am—sixty-two if he is a day.
  His father was my elder brother by an early marriage with his first wife’s
  sister.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Oh!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Well, it’s all settled, then, you accept
  me?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Never!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(crossing, r.)</stage> Then, madam, I shall be under the
  stern necessity of compelling you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(frightened)</stage> How?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>By
  completely and thoroughly compromising you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>But you have said that you should
  render me miserable—</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>It would only be with too much love—<stage>(passionately)</stage> for I do
  love you, I adore you! And if you refuse me, I will open the doors, the windows—I will call, will
  shout, will fight—</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Oh, this is terrible!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>When passion rules
  me, I am capable of everything, even of opening a window, <stage>(taking a step, she stops
  him)</stage></p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>Do not—</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(joyfully)</stage> You consent?</p><p>Mrs. M.
   <stage>(resignedly)</stage> I consent, <stage>(falls into a chair near fire­place)</stage></p><pb n="16"/></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>
  Thank you, thank you! Ah! I have something to say that will delight you—I have told you that I was
  fifty-three, I give you my honour I am nothing of the sort—I am only fifty-two and eight
  months.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>What matters ? Only, sir, as we are now situated, allow me to charge
  you with a delicate mission.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Anything you please, madam! <stage>(with great joy)</stage>
  any­thing—anything!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(pointing to mantel-piece)</stage> You will find, in that coffer,
  letters and a portrait, presents that I have accepted. You will be good enough, sir, to restore
  them to the person from whom I have received them, <stage>(she rises)</stage></p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(crossing L., and
  taking coffer from mantel-piece)</stage> Excuse me—but—</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>As you are about
  to become my husband——</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Ah! that’s true ! <stage>(opening a letter)</stage></p><p>Mrs. M.
  Oh ! do not read, sir.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>As you are about to become my wife—</p><p>Mrs. M.
  Ah! that’s true!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(running over the letter)</stage> Oh, oh ! I say—"a thousand burning
  kisses”—that’s too hot!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> <stage>(vexed)</stage> Allow me—<stage>(aside)</stage> Twenty thousand pounds! <stage>(aloud)</stage>
  Your honour exacts it—I have compromised you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p><stage>(smiling)</stage> Oh! an uncle of
  fifty-three.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> I beg your pardon, fifty-two—</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>And eight
  months.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>No matter—a man may be a man at fifty-two and eight
  months.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mrs M.</speaker><p>And besides, in what have you compromised me ? Is it not quite natural
  that an uncle who arrives in London should pay a visit to his niece ? Uncle—<stage>(pointing to door L.)</stage>
  that way you will find your chamber.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>Ah! you have a chamber?</p><p>Mrs. M.
  Which stays for you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>And you didn’t tell me so! Bundled me into an arm chair,

  <stage>(meekly)</stage> Yes, uncle</p><pb n="17"/>
  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz,</speaker><p> Ah! it can’t be more downy than you are though.</p>
  <p>Mrs. M. To-morrow your luggage shall be brought here, and you shall instal yourself as my

  </sp><sp><speaker>Fitz.</speaker><p>To be sure; nobody can have anything to say against  that.</p>
