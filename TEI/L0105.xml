    <head>Act I.</head>
    <stage>Scene I.— A Merchant's Counting-house —Doors.R and L. — Large opening in flat, through
     which is seen Wareroom in the distance—Desk R. and L. — A writing table covered with papers —
     Table and chair R,— Bales and other packages lying about in different directions. </stage>
    <stage>Peg, Joseph, and Workmen discovered.</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jos.</speaker>
     <p><stage>( directing Workmen, and placing a bale on truck)</stage>All right, Mr. Peg?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Peg.</speaker>
     <p><stage>( seated at desk L., marking off from invoice)</stage>All right, and you may
      go.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jos.</speaker>
     <p>If I might be so bold, Mr, Peg, the men have asked me to ask you to ask Mr. Anstead to beg
      a holiday to celebrate Miss Mildred's wedding.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Peg.</speaker>
     <p>I'll speak to her father about it</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jos.</speaker>
     <p>Thank you, Sir.</p>
     <stage>Exit , wheeling off bale of goods, L.C.</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Peg.</speaker>
     <p>Now let me enter these goods. <stage>(writes)</stage></p>
     <stage>Enter Polly Dodds, R.D.</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pol,</speaker>
     <p><stage>(R.)</stage>) Good morning, Mr. Peg. Have you seen Miss Mildred?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Peg.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(coming down L.)</stage>Don't talk of Miss Mildred, but think of me, Polly. How
      well you look!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
     <p>D'ye think so, Mr. Peg?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Peg.</speaker>
     <p>I know so, and that's beyond thinking. This bit of machinery <stage>(placing his hand upon
      his heart)</stage>assures me of the fact.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
     <p>Ob, Mr. Peg, you mustn't talk like that. You know I am an affianced one.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Peg.</speaker>
     <p>Affianced be smothered ! As long as you're single, you're in the market, and I've as much
      right to bid for you as another. If you would but knock yourself down to me!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
     <p>I haven't put myself up yet; and depend upon it, when I do, I'll buy in, at any sacrifice,
      sooner than be knocked down to a mere Peg!</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Peg.</speaker>
     <p>Miss Polly, you're an unmitigated flirt Before that Quaker chap came, I was your "dear
      Peg!"—your "kind Peg!"—your "only Peg!"</p>
     <stage>Enter Tobias Dove , at back, C. from L. </stage>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(seizing Peg by the collar)</stage>Calumniator! Did I ever say you were my Peg?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Peg.</speaker>
     <p>You looked it, if you didn't say it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
     <p>Looked it? <stage>(shakes him)</stage>How dare you interpret my looks? How do I look now
      ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Peg.</speaker>
     <p>Let me go, and I'll tell you.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(releasing him)</stage>There ! Now, how do I look ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Peg.</speaker>
     <p>Like a fury, as you are! <stage>( runs off L.D.)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tob.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(coming forward, R.)</stage>Thou hast acted like a spirited damsel, and I do love
      thee, verily—hum!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
     <p>Did you hear what he said?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tob.</speaker>
     <p>Yea, and it did gladden my heart when thou did'st call me thy affianced--hum!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
     <p>Pray, Mr. Tobias, how came you to suppose it was you I meant?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tob.</speaker>
     <p>Because, maiden, I have pressed thy hand and kissed thy cheek, and it did seem to please
      thee.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
     <p>Toby, Toby, I believe you're a great hypocrite!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tob.</speaker>
     <p>Put me to the proof, damsel, and thou'lt not find me wanting.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
     <p>Don't "damsel" and "maiden" me! I wont be called out of my name!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tob.</speaker>
     <p>Verily—hum!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean by " verily—hum?" My name is plain Polly Dodds!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tob.</speaker>
     <p>I mean, plain Polly Dodds, that I have spoken of my intentions regarding thee to our
      master, and he consenting, verily, I will gird up my loins and marry thee.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
     <p>Marry me?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tob.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(R.)</stage>Yea, without delay I will make thee my rib !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(L.)</stage>Your what?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tob.</speaker>
     <p>My spare rib!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(crosses to R. )</stage>Spare yourself the trouble, Mr. Tobias. Does master think I
      am made like his stockings, to be worn by any calf that can afford to pay for me? No, Sir; you
      shall find me a web that isn't to be unravelled by a—hum !</p>
     <stage>Exit R,D.</stage>
     <stage>Enter Jacob Anstead, L.D.</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>Tobias, what are you doing here?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tob.</speaker>
     <p>Verily, I was cogitating.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>Does your master pay you for cogitating in <hi>my</hi>office, when yon should be writing
      in your own ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tob.</speaker>
     <p>I came to hold converse with the handmaiden, plain Polly Dodds.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>Ha, ha, ha! Plain Polly Dodds will be your ruin, Get to work, silly fellow, and drive her
      from your head.</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tob.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, verily—hum!</p>

     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(sits R. of L. table)</stage>Ha, ha, ha! Cupid has many freaks, and this is not
      the least of the rascal's tricks. My poor Mildred, too! She is But I must be blind! Honour
      before all—yes , before all!</p>
     <stage>Enter Mildred, R.D,— Not seeing her father, she sits L. at R. table, covers her face
      with her hands, and seems absorbed in grief —Jacob watches her intently for a moment or two.

     <p>Milly!</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(confusedly)</stage>Father!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>Tears? What am I to think ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
     <p>Not that I have been crying, father.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>No, my child, no. Tears are proofs of anything but grief,—— dewdrops, Milly, which fall but
      to refresh my beautiful rose. Is it not so.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
     <p>Dear father, you will not be angry because I am out of spirits, fatigued, and</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(pettishly, but fondly)</stage>You are an idle, good-for-nothing little puss!
      There—there—get along,—you are growing silly, girl!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
     <p>And you are growing cross—very cross, and harsh—to me, at least, <stage>( approaches
      him)</stage>Have I offended you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>No, my darling, no; but go, now, and mind your work, nor hinder me from mine.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
     <p>But, dear father —<stage>(bursts into tears)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(severely)</stage>Tears again ? What do they mean!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
     <p>I do not know.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>You do not love Caleb,—he is not good enough, handsome enough, for so fine a lady.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
     <p>I think him very handsome, father, and quite good enough for me; but—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>You do not know the value of an honest heart.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
     <p>Indeed, indeed, I <hi>esteem</hi>Caleb <hi>much</hi>, but I fear I shall never know how to
      please or make him <hi>happy.</hi></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>Nature is a rare teacher, Milly.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
     <p>Then, I am so young.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>Old enough to cause a deal of mischief. <stage>(affectionately)</stage>Come, come.
      <stage>(kisses her)</stage>Dry your tears, and work while I write. <stage>( she is going
      towards R.D.)</stage>What are you running away for? You are never with me now.</p>
     <p>Mil, Indeed, father, I am too happy to remain with you ; but while you are at those
      accounts, you cannot even look at me.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>Then you can look at <hi>me</hi>—you've nothing better to do.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
     <p>Look at <hi>you</hi>?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(writing)</stage>If I am not ugly enough to frighten you.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
     <p>You, father? That good, kind face—those dear white hairs!</p>
     <p>You? To <hi>me</hi>you are most beautiful!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>Look at me attentively, and tell me your thoughts.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
     <p>May I speak honestly?</p>
     <pb n="6"/>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(putting down his pen)</stage>Or not at all.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
     <p>Then I think that you would die, as you have lived, for Mr. Buscoyne—that you would
      sacrifice, to <hi>duty</hi>, <hi>your</hi>happiness and <hi>mine</hi>.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(after a pause, rises, and pushes her gently to R.D.)</stage>Go along! If you have
      anything to do, I'll not detain you.</p>

     <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
     <p>I will see if Julia ——</p>

     <p>That young lady is our master's daughter!</p>

     <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(catches Jacob's eye)</stage>If my mistress wants me.</p>

     <p>That's right!</p>

     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>Do you deserve it ?—from the bottom of your heart, do you deserve it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
     <p>I do.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>There, then, <stage>(kisses her)</stage>Bless thee, my darling, bless thee! Now run
      away.</p>
     <stage>Exit Mildred, R.D.</stage>
     <p>—<stage>(Jacob watches her as she goes out, then reseats himself)</stage>Young, weak, and
      restless!—honest as the day, and beautiful as <stage>(with emotion)</stage>her mother ! </p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(sitting at desk L.)</stage>Do you reproach me for loving your daughter, Mr.
      Anstead ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>Reproach you ? No, my boy , no; providing the books do not suffer—that you don't neglect
      your duty.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p>Duty is as much my religion as your own.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>I believed so, or I shouldn't have chosen you for my son. Caleb, you are an honest
      fellow—punctual in business, and I think, spite of your blunt temper, a reasonable man.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p>Sir!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>Mildred is not rich, but she is good and virtuous.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p>A priceless dowry for the husband of her choice !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>And she loves you.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p>Are you sure of that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>I have already told you my means are not large. Mr. Buscoyne often wished to add to them,
      but I would never allow it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p>Why not? I am ambitious—I would be rich.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>You are rich in honesty and industry, and I am satisfied.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p>You are disinterested, Mr. Anstead.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>Why should I be otherwise?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(searchingly)</stage>Have you no ambition even for your, child? You do not wish her
      to become rich ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>No. I follow my master's example. He prays only for his daughter's virtue—his son's
      honour.</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>None. Born of a noble house, he sees no degradation in becoming a simple merchant.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(coming down R.H.)</stage>Humph! Does the son share the father's sentiments?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>As yet, Master Randolph has no fixed principles,—he is young, generous, and I regard him as
      though he were my own.</p>
     <stage>Enter Randolph Buscoyne, R.D.</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Ran.</speaker>
     <p>Twenty pounds, if you please, Mr. Jacob—I've some purchases to make this morning.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>I will fetch them, Master Randolph, I will fetch them, <stage>(he hastens off
      L.C)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Ran.</speaker>
     <p>Well, Caleb, when is your marriage to come off?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(coming down L.)</stage>The day is fixed, Sir.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Ran.</speaker>
     <p>Bravo!—then I shall dance at the wedding.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(coldly)</stage>We shall be too much honoured, Sir.'</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Ran.</speaker>
     <p>Not at all, I wish you joy with all my heart, for you are going to marry the sweetest
      creature in existence, Mildred, my sister, and myself were brought up together. Julia was
      tolerably good—I wasn't bad; but. Milly—dear little Milly—was always better than either of us.
      You'll not object to a wedding-present from her brother ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p>Then , I presume, this—twenty pounds, Sir ?—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Ran.</speaker>
     <p>Tush ! never mind the sum, You give me permission ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(Haughtily)</stage>Sir, if my wife—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Ran.</speaker>
     <p>Ha, ha, ha ! You call her wife even before you are married. Your wife! Ha, ha, ha!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p>The jest is pointless, Mr. Randolph.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Ran.</speaker>
     <p>My dear fellow, I did not wish to hurt your feelings. Come, have I your permission?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p>Mildred is not yet my wife, and I cannot control her. She may accept or reject your gift,
      as best pleases her.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Ran.</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! she will not refuse <hi>me</hi>; if she does, it will be the first time in her
      life,—there is no pride in her. But you are not well?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p>Perfectly.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Ran.</speaker>
     <p>Well, then, you are out of humour—and that is so unlike Milly. I left her just now singing
      like a blackbird.</p>

     <p><stage>(inquiringly)</stage>You have seen her?—this morning?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Ran.</speaker>
     <p>Of course I have. I couldn't eat my breakfast until I had been greeted by her merry laugh.
      She's a little angel, Caleb, and you are a lucky fellow in gaining; such a creature.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(with suppressed anger)</stage>I want to marry a woman not an angel.</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Caleb, this language is new to me. I did not expect rudeness from you—from one who used to
      be so gentle, so kind.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p>It is not in my nature to woo with soft speeches; but, stern and rugged as that nature is,
      you could do much to soften it. Teach me, then—teach me , dear Mildred, how to win you!</p>

      prize the possession of this little hand, you would not take it from me. Mildred, I am not a
      man of many words—not easily moved. I do not know how to speak as daintily as others. Few
      words come to me on any occasion. 1 could call you "Angel!" "Light !" "Life!"—but these are
      commonplace, unmeaning terms, and poorly express what I would say.</p>

      <hi>kiss</hi>Sally Pots—the squinting cat !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tob.</speaker>
     <p>Does the maiden squint ? Verily that escaped my scrutiny,</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, then you <hi>did</hi>look ? I shall wish you good day, Mr. Dove. I thought in choosing
      a plain man like you I should be able to keep you to myself.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tob.</speaker>
     <p>And so thou shal't, Polly! If thou wilt but hear me, I will convince thee of my innocence.
      Where was I ?</p>

     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
     <p>Indulging in your weakness.</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Tob.</speaker>
     <p>Sally spake, and said "how doth the lovely maiden, Polly Dodds! Dost thou love that
      virtuous damsel, Tobias ?" Spake she. Yes, verily, spake I—hum !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
     <p>Don't stand toeing and heeling them, but make haste and come to the end.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tob.</speaker>
     <p>She did farther say, "I can tell thee a secret, friend Tobias— maiden, Polly Dodds, doth
      love thee dearly,"</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
     <p>She said that did she ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tob.</speaker>
     <p>Verily, and my heart leaped in my bosom, and jumped to my lips; and my lips, despite my
      virtuous scruples, did thank her with an old fashioned salute, called a kiss, as a reward for
      the intelligence and happiness she had given me—hum !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
     <p>I don't know whether I ought to believe this story, Tobias.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tob.</speaker>
     <p>I will give thee a proof of my sincerity.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
     <p>How?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tob.</speaker>
     <p>By making thee bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh—in other words, I will endow thee
      with my name, and all that I can call mine own.</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>It sha'n't! I have confidence in my daughter—in Caleb— in myself—and, above all, in heaven
      ! When I married her mother, she did not love me much. I was old, austere, unbending, as Caleb
      now is,—yet she died blessing me. But will you not read the letter ? It may be of consequence.

     <p>Mr. Anstead, this assumed temper cannot impose upon me !</p>

     <p>Temper? What is it you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p>I mean that a man, mysteriously enveloped in cloak and hat, has been seen in the garden.
      That man Is no stranger to the house.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>You alarm me !—perhaps a thief!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p>Thief? Yes,—for he would steal a jewel so dear to me, that I would sacrifice my life to
      preserve it!</p>

     <p>Well, then, what do you suspect?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p>Everything ! Jacob Anstead, I have been deceived ! You found me contented with my humble
      lot, happy in my industry, ignorant of love, dreaming not of it, until you placed a tempter in
      my path who lured me to her toils. <hi>Why</hi>give your daughter to me ? <hi>Why</hi>in
      such haste to conclude our marriage ? <hi>Why</hi>suffer Mildred to receive a portion from
      Mr. Buscoyne. <hi>Why</hi>did Randolph leave this house the moment my suspicions were known,
      and why does he return to it in secresy and disguise ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(after a struggle)</stage>Caleb, I give you my daughter because I wish her to wed
      an honest man. Mr. Buscoyne portions her because he regards me. This vexes you, so much the
      better. I like your independent spirit. The money shall be returned, <stage>(aside)</stage>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>Master Randolph, witnessing your absurd jealousy, he followed the impulse of his noble
      nature, and departed from his father's house?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(sneeringly)</stage>Departed ! Where is he now ? Is it the impulse of a noble
      nature to return like a thief in the night, and steal into that father's house.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
     <p>If he has returned, which I do not believe, depend upon it he has a sufficient motive for
      his concealment.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cal.</speaker>
     <p>No doubt. Were he to abduct your daughter before your very eyes, you would scarcely believe
      those eyes, such confidence do you place in his noble nature.</p>

     <p>Don't alarm yourself—there is not much the matter. My father wished me to obtain

      in Mr. Jacob's desk ?</p>

     <p>He has. But why write—why not have seen him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Ran.</speaker>
     <p>Because—because I wish to see him alone, and I could not do that until the family had
      retired to rest. I cannot even gain my own room, so close is Caleb on my heels.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Ah, brother. When we love truly we ask no questions of the future, but love, because we

     <p>Mildred, this is folly. Open your heart to us ; am I not your brother, Julia, your sister.

      love.</p>
    </sp>

     <p>I was not aware of so amiable a surveillance under my father's roof, but since you have
