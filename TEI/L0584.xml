    <head>ACT I.</head>
    <div type="scene">
     <head>SCENE FIRST -- An Apartment in the Tower.</head>

     <stage>Enter the Duke of Gloster, Sir Richard Ratcliffe, and Sir William Catesby, R.</stage>


     <sp>
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <stage>(C) </stage>
      <l>Thus far success attends upon our councils,</l>
      <l>And each event has answer'd to my wish;</l>
      <l>The queen and all her upstart race are quell'd;</l>
      <l>Dorset is banish'd, and her brother Rivers,</l>
      <l>Ere this, lies shorter by the head at Pomfret.</l>
      <l>The nobles have, with joint concurrence, nam'd me</l>
      <l>Protector of the realm: my brother's children,</l>
      <l>Young Edward and the little York, are lodg'd</l>
      <l>Here, safe within the Tower. How say you, sirs,</l>
      <l>Does not this business wear a lucky face?</l>
      <l>The sceptre and the golden wreath of royalty</l>
      <l>Seem hung within my reach.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ratclif.</speaker>
      <stage>(R.C.)</stage>
      <l>Then take 'em to you,</l>
      <l>And wear them long and worthily: you are</l>
      <l>The last remaining male of princely York,</l>
      <l>(For Edward's boys, the state esteems not of 'em,)</l>
      <l>And therefore on your sov'reignty and rule</l>
      <l>The commonweal does her dependence make,</l>
      <l>And leans upon your highness' able hand.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Cates.</speaker>
      <stage> (L.C.)</stage>
      <l>And yet to-morrow does the council meet</l>
      <l>To fix a day for Edward's coronation.</l>
      <l>Who can expound this riddle?</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <l>That can I.</l>
      <l>Those lords are each one my approv'd good friends,</l>
      <pb n="4"/>
      <l>Of special trust and nearness to my bosom;</l>
      <l>And, howsoever busy they may seem,</l>
      <l>And diligent to bustle in the state,</l>
      <l>Their zeal goes on no further than we lead,</l>
      <l>And at our bidding stays.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Cates.</speaker>
      <l>Yet there is one,</l>
      <l>And he amongst the foremost in his power,</l>
      <l>Of whom I wish your highness were assur'd.</l>
      <l>For me, perhaps it is my nature's fault,</l>
      <l>I own I doubt of his inclining much.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <l>I guess the man at whom your words would point:</l>
      <l>Hastings—</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Cates.</speaker>
      <l>The same.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <l>He bears me great good will.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Cates.</speaker>
      <l>'Tis true, to you, as to the lord protector,</l>
      <l>And Gloster's duke, he bows with lowly service:</l>
      <l>But were he bid to cry, God save king Richard,</l>
      <l>Then tell me in what terms he would reply.</l>
      <l>Believe me, I have prov'd the man, and found him:</l>
      <l>I know he bears a most religious reverence</l>
      <l>To his dead master Edward's royal memory,</l>
      <l>And whither that may lead him, is most plain.</l>
      <l>Yet more—One of that stubborn sort he is,</l>
      <l>Who, if they once grow fond of an opinion,</l>
      <l>They call it honour, honesty, and faith,</l>
      <l>And sooner part with life than let it go.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <l>And yet this tough, impracticable, heart,</l>
      <l>Is govern'd by a dainty-finger'd girl;</l>
      <l>Such flaws are found in the most worthy natures;</l>
      <l>A laughing, toying, wheedling, whimpering, she,</l>
      <l>Shall make him amble on a gossip's message,</l>
      <l>And take the distaff with a hand as patient</l>
      <l>As e'er did Hercules.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Ratclif.</speaker>
      <l>The fair Alicia,</l>
      <l>Of noble birth and exquisite of feature,</l>
      <l>Has held him long a vassal to her beauty.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Cates.</speaker>
      <l>I fear, he fails in his allegiance there;</l>
      <l>Or my intelligence is false, or else</l>
      <l>The dame has been too lavish of her feast,</l>
      <l>And fed him till he loathes.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <l>No more, he comes.</l>
      <stage>(Ratcliffe and Catesby retire back and confer, R</stage>
     </sp>
     <pb n="5"/>
     <stage>Enter Lord Hastings.</stage>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Hast.</speaker>
      <stage>(L.C.)</stage>
      <l>Health, and the happiness of many days,</l>
      <l>Attend upon your grace.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <stage> (C)</stage>
      <l>My good lord chamberlain,</l>
      <l>We're much beholden to your gentle friendship.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Hast.</speaker>
      <l>My lord, I come an humble suitor to you.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <l>In right good time. Speak out your pleasure freely.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Hast.</speaker>
      <l>I am to move your highness in behalf</l>
      <l>Of Shore's unhappy wile.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <l>Say you, of Shore?</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Hast.</speaker>
      <l>Once a bright star, that held her place on high:</l>
      <l>The first and fairest of our English dames,</l>
      <l>While royal Edward held the sov'reign rule.</l>
      <l>Now, sunk in grief and pining with despair,</l>
      <l>Her waning form no longer shall incite</l>
      <l>Envy in woman, or desire in man.</l>
      <l>She never sees the sun, but through her tears,</l>
      <l>And wakes to sigh the live-long night away.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <l>Marry! the times are badly chang'd with her,</l>
      <l>From Edward's days to these. Then all was jollity,</l>
      <l>Feasting and mirth, light wantonness and laughter,</l>
      <l>Piping and playing, minstrelsy and masking;</l>
      <l>'Till life fled from us like an idle dream,</l>
      <l>A show of mummery without a meaning.</l>
      <l>My brother, rest and pardon to his soul,</l>
      <l>Is gone to his account; for this his minion,</l>
      <l>The revel-rout is done—But you were speaking</l>
      <l>Concerning her—I have been told, that you</l>
      <l>Are frequent in your visitation to her.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Hast.</speaker>
      <l>No further, my good lord, than friendly pity</l>
      <l>And tender-hearted charity allow.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <l>Go to: I did not mean to chide you for it.</l>
      <l>For, sooth to say, I hold it noble in you</l>
      <l>To cherish the distress'd.—On with your tale.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Hast.</speaker>
      <l>Thus it is, gracious sir, that certain officers,</l>
      <l>Using the warrant of your mighty name,</l>
      <l>With insolence unjust, and lawless power,</l>
      <l>Have seiz'd upon the lands, which late she held</l>
      <l>By grant, from her great master Edward's bounty.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <l>Somewhat of this, but slightly, have I heard;</l>
      <l>And though some counsellors of forward zeal,</l>
      <pb n="6"/>
      <l>Some of most ceremonious sanctity</l>
      <l>And bearded wisdom, often have provok'd</l>
      <l>The hand of justice to fall heavy on her;</l>
      <l>Yet still, in kind compassion of her weakness,</l>
      <l>And tender memory of Edward's love,</l>
      <l>I have withheld the merciless stern law</l>
      <l>From doing outrage on her helpless beauty.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Hast.</speaker>
      <l>Good heav'n, who renders mercy back for mercy,</l>
      <l>With open-handed bounty shall repay you:</l>
      <l>This gentle deed shall fairly he set foremost,</l>
      <l>To screen the wild escapes of lawless passion,</l>
      <l>And the long train of frailties flesh is heir to.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <l>Thus far, the voice of pity pleaded only:</l>
      <l>Our further and more full extent of grace</l>
      <l>Is given to your request. Let her attend,</l>
      <l>And to ourself deliver up her griefs.</l>
      <l>She shall be heard with patience, and each wrong</l>
      <l>At full redress'd. But I have other news,</l>
      <l>Which much import us both; for still my fortunes</l>
      <l>Go hand in hand with yours: our common foes,</l>
      <l>The queen's relations, our new-fangled gentry,</l>
      <l>Have fall'n their haughty crests—that for your privacy.</l>

      <l>How few, like thee, inquire the wretched out,</l>

      <l>Like thee, reserve their raiment for the naked,</l>

      <l>My lord, you're well encounter'd; here has been</l>
      <l>A fair petitioner this morning with us;</l>
      <l>Believe me, she has won me much to pity her:</l>
      <l>Alas! her gentle nature was not made</l>
      <l>To buffet with adversity. I told her</l>
      <l>How worthily her cause you had befriended;</l>
      <l>How much for your good sake we meant to do,</l>
      <l>That you had spoke, and all things should be well.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Hast.</speaker>
      <l>Your highness binds me ever to your service.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <l><stage>(R.C.)</stage> You know your friendship is most potent with us,</l>
      <l>And shares our power. But of this enough,</l>
      <l>For we have other matters for your ear.</l>
      <l>The state is out of tune: distracting fears,</l>
      <l>And jealous doubts, jar in our public councils;</l>
      <l>Amidst the wealthy city, murmurs rise,</l>
      <l>Lewd railings, and reproach on those that rule,</l>
      <l>With open scorn of government; hence credit,</l>
      <l>And public trust 'twixt man and man, are broke.</l>
      <l>The golden streams of commerce are withheld,</l>
      <l>Which fed the wants of needy hinds and artizans,</l>
      <l>Who therefore curse the great, and threat rebellion.</l>

      <l>The resty knaves are over-run with ease,</l>

      <pb n="26"/>
      <l>Grow madly wanton and repine, it is</l>
      <l>Because the reins of power are held too slack,</l>
      <l>And reverend authority of late</l>
      <l>Has worn a face of mercy more than justice.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <l>Beshrew my heart! but you have well divin'd</l>
      <l>The source of these disorders. Who can wonder</l>
      <l>If riot and misrule o'erturn the realm,</l>
      <l>When the crown sits upon a baby brow?</l>
      <l>Plainly to speak, hence comes the gen'ral cry,</l>
      <l>And sum of all complaint: 'twill ne'er be well</l>
      <l>With England (thus they talk) while children govern.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Hast.</speaker>
      <l>'Tis true, the king is young: but what of that?</l>
      <l>We feel no want of Edward's riper years,</l>
      <l>While Gloster's valour and most princely wisdom</l>
      <l>So well support our infant sov'reign's place,</l>
      <l>His youth's support, and guardian to his throne.</l>
     </sp>

      <l>Barren of pow'r, and subject to controul;</l>
      <l>Scorn'd by my foes, and useless to my friends.</l>
      <l>Oh, worthy lord! were mine the rule indeed,</l>
      <l>I think I should not suffer rank offence</l>
      <l>At large to lord it in the commonweal;</l>
      <l>Nor would the realm be rent by discord thus,</l>
      <l>Thus fear and doubt, betwixt disputed titles.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <l>Ay, marry, but there is——</l>

      <l>How, on a late occasion, doctor Shaw</l>
      <l>Has mov'd the people much about the lawfulness</l>
      <l>Of Edward's issue? By right grave authority</l>
      <l>Of learning and religion, plainly proving,</l>

      <l>And vex the quiet world with their vain scruples!</l>
      <l>By heav'n, 'tis done in perfect spite to peace.</l>
      <l>Did not the king</l>
      <l>Our royal master, Edward, in concurrence</l>
      <l>With his estates assembled, well determine</l>
      <l>What course the sov'reign rule should take henceforward?</l>
      <l>When shall the deadly hate of faction cease,</l>
      <l>When shall our long-divided land have rest,</l>
      <l>If every peevish, moody, malecontent,</l>
      <l>Shall set the senseless rabble in an uproar,</l>
      <l>Fright them with dangers, and perplex their brains</l>
      <l>Each day with some fantastic giddy change?</l>

      <l>In thy great day of vengeance! Blast the traitor</l>

     <head>SCENE FIRST—A Street of Old London—an arch, C.—Alicia's house, R.</head>
     <stage>Enter Belmour and Dumont, as Shore, R.</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l><stage>(R.C.)</stage> You saw her, then?</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Belmour.</speaker>
      <l><stage>(C.)</stage> I met her, as returning</l>
      <l>In solemn penance from the public cross.</l>
      <l>Before her, certain rascal officers,</l>
      <l>Slaves in authority, the knaves of justice,</l>
      <l>Proclaim'd the tyrant Gloster's cruel orders.</l>
      <l>Around her, numberless, the rabble flow'd,</l>
      <l>Should'ring each other, crowding for a view,</l>
      <l>Gaping and gazing, taunting and reviling;</l>
      <l>Some pitying—but those, alas! how few!</l>
      <l>The most, such iron hearts we are, and such</l>
      <l>The base barbarity of human-kind,</l>
      <l>With insolence and lewd reproach pursu'd her,</l>
      <l>Hooting and railing, and with villanous hands</l>
      <l>Gath'ring the filth from out the common ways,</l>
      <l>To hurl upon her head.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l>Inhuman dogs!</l>
      <l>How did she bear it?</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Belmour.</speaker>
      <l>With the gentlest patience;</l>
      <l>Submissive, sad, and lowly, was her look;</l>
      <l>A burning taper in her hand she bore,</l>
      <l>And on her shoulders carelessly confus'd,</l>
      <l>With loose neglect, her lovely tresses hung;</l>
      <l>Upon her cheek a faintish blush was spread;</l>
      <l>Feeble she seem'd, and sorely smit with pain.</l>
      <l>While, barefoot as she trod the flinty pavement,</l>
      <l>Her footsteps all along were mark'd with blood;</l>
      <l>Yet, silent still she pass'd, and unrepining:</l>
      <l>Her streaming eyes bent ever on the earth,</l>
      <pb n="42"/>
      <l>Except when, in some bitter pang of sorrow,</l>
      <l>To heav'n she seem'd in fervent zeal to raise,</l>
      <l>And beg that mercy man deny'd her here.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l>When was this piteous sight?</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Belmour.</speaker>
      <l>These last two days.</l>
      <l>You know my care was wholly bent on you,</l>
      <l>To find the happy means of your deliverance,</l>
      <l>Which but for Hastings' death I had not gain'd.</l>
      <l>During that time, although I have not seen her,</l>
      <l>Yet divers trusty messengers I've sent,</l>
      <l>To wait about, and watch a fit convenience</l>
      <l>To give her some relief, but all in vain;</l>
      <l>A churlish guard attends upon her steps,</l>
      <l>Who menace those with death, that bring her comfort,<stage> </stage></l>
      <l>And drive all succour from her.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l>Let 'em threaten;</l>
      <l>Let proud oppression prove its fiercest malice;</l>
      <l>So heav'n befriend my soul, as here I vow</l>
      <l>To give her help, and share one fortune with her.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Belmour.</speaker>
      <l>Mean you to see her thus in your own form?</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l>I do.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Belmour.</speaker>
      <l>And have you thought upon the consequence? </l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l>What is there I should fear?</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Belmour.</speaker>
      <l>Have you examin'd</l>
      <l>Into your inmost heart, and try'd at leisure</l>
      <l>The sev'ral secret springs that move the passions?</l>
      <l>Has mercy fix'd her empire there so sure,</l>
      <l>That wrath and vengeance never may return?</l>
      <l>Can you resume a husband's name, and bid</l>
      <l>That wakeful dragon, fierce resentment, sleep?</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l>O thou hast set my busy brain at work,</l>
      <l>And now she musters up a train of images,</l>
      <l>Which, to preserve my peace, I had cast aside,</l>
      <l>And sunk in deep oblivion—Oh, that form!</l>
      <l>That angel face on which my dotage hung!</l>
      <l>How I have gaz'd upon her, till my soul</l>
      <l>With very eagerness went forth towards her,</l>
      <l>And issu'd at my eyes.—Was there a gem</l>
      <l>Which the sun ripens in the Indian mine,</l>
      <l>Or the rich bosom of the ocean yields?</l>
      <l>What was there art could make, or wealth could buy,</l>
      <l>Which I have left unsought to deck her beauty?</l>
      <l>What could her king do more?—And yet she fled.</l>
     </sp>
     <pb n="43"/>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Belmour.</speaker>
      <l>Away with that sad fancy——</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l>Oh, that day!</l>
      <l>The thought of it must live for ever with me.</l>
      <l>I met her, Belmour, when the royal spoiler</l>
      <l>Bore her in triumph from my widow'd home!</l>
      <l>Within his chariot, by his side, she sat,</l>
      <l>And listen'd to his talk with downward looks,</l>
      <l>'Till, sudden as she chanc'd aside to glance,</l>
      <l>Her eyes encounter'd mine—Oh! then, my friend!</l>
      <l>Oh! who can paint my grief and her amazement!</l>
      <l>As at the stroke of death, twice turn'd she pale;</l>
      <l>And twice a burning crimson blush'd all o'er her;</l>
      <l>Then, with a shriek heart-wounding, loud she cry'd,</l>
      <l>While down her cheeks two gushing torrents ran</l>
      <l>Fast falling on her hands, which thus she wrung——</l>
      <l>Mov'd at her grief, the tyrant ravisher,</l>
      <l>With courteous action, woo'd her oft to turn;</l>
      <l>Earnest he seem'd to plead, but all in vain;</l>
      <l>Ev'n to the last she bent her sight towards me,</l>
      <l>And follow'd me——till I had lost myself.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Belmour.</speaker>
      <l>Alas, for pity! Oh! those speaking tears!</l>
      <l>Could they be false? did she not suffer with you.</l>
      <l>For, though the king by force possess'd her person,</l>
      <l>Her unconsenting heart dwelt still with you?</l>
      <l>If all her former woes were not enough,</l>
      <l>Look on her now; behold her where she wanders,</l>
      <l>Hunted to death, distress'd on every side,</l>
      <l>With no one hand to help; and tell me then,</l>
      <l>If ever misery were known like hers?</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l>And can she bear it? Can that delicate frame</l>
      <l>Endure the beating of a storm so rude?</l>
      <l>Can she, for whom the various seasons chang'd</l>
      <l>To court her appetite and crown her board,</l>
      <l>For whom the foreign vintages were press'd,</l>
      <l>For whom the merchant spread his silken stores,</l>
      <l>Can she——</l>
      <l>Entreat for bread, and want the needful raiment</l>
      <l>To wrap her shiv'ring bosom from the weather?</l>
      <l>When she was mine, no care came ever nigh her;</l>
      <l>I thought the gentlest breeze that wakes the spring</l>
      <l>Too rough to breathe upon her; cheerfulness</l>
      <pb n="44"/>
      <l>Danc'd all the day before her, and at night</l>
      <l>Soft slumbers waited on her downy pillow—</l>
      <l>Now, sad and shelterless, perhaps she lies,</l>
      <l>Where piercing winds blow sharp, and the chill rain</l>
      <l>Drops from some pent-house on her wretched head,</l>
      <l>Drenches her locks, and kills her with the cold.</l>
      <l>It is too much.——Hence with her past offences,</l>
      <l>They are aton'd at full.——Why stay we then?</l>
      <l>Oh! let us haste, my friend, and find her out.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Belmour.</speaker>
      <l>Somewhere about this quarter of the town,</l>
      <l>I hear the poor abandon'd creature lingers:</l>
      <l>Her guard, though set with strictest watch to keep</l>
      <l>All food and friendship from her, yet permit her</l>
      <l>To wander in the streets, there choose her bed,</l>
      <l>And rest her head on what cold stone she pleases.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l>Here then let us divide; each in his round</l>
      <l>To search her sorrows out; whose hap it is</l>
      <l>First to behold her, this way let him lead</l>
      <l>Her fainting steps, and meet we here together.<stage>Exeunt Dumont, L. 1 E., Belmour, R. 1

     <stage>After a pause, enter Jane Shore, C. from L., her hair hanging loose on her shoulders,
      her feet bare. </stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <l>Yet, yet, endure, nor murmur, O, my soul!</l>
      <l>For are not thy transgressions great and numberless?</l>
      <l>Do they not cover thee like rising floods,</l>
      <l>And press thee like a weight of waters down?</l>
      <l>Wait then with patience, till the circling hours</l>
      <l>Shall bring the time of thy appointed rest,</l>
      <l>And lay thee down in death.</l>
      <l>And, hark! methinks the roar, that late pursu'd me,</l>
      <l>Sinks like the murmurs of a falling wind,</l>
      <l>And softens into silence. Does revenge</l>
      <l>And malice then grow weary, and forsake me?</l>
      <l>My guard, too, that observ'd me still so close,</l>
      <l>Tire in the task of their inhuman office,</l>
      <l>And loiter far behind. Alas! I faint,</l>
      <l>My spirits fail at once—this is the door</l>

      <l>The dear companions of thy joyful days,</l>
      <l>Whose hearts thy warm prosperity made glad,</l>
      <l>Whose arms were taught to grow like ivy round thee,</l>
      <l>And bind thee to their bosoms? <stage>(kneels and takes her hand, she raises her
       head</stage> "Thus, with thee,</l>
      <l>Thus let us live, and let us die," they said.</l>
      <l>Now where are they?</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <l>Ah, Belmour! where, indeed? They stand aloof,</l>
      <l>And view my desolation from afar!</l>
      <l>And yet thy goodness turns aside to pity me.</l>
      <l>Alas! there may be danger; get thee gone.</l>
      <l>Let me not pull a ruin on thy head.</l>
      <l>Leave me to die alone, for I am fall'n</l>
      <l>Never to rise, and all relief is vain.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Belmour.</speaker>
      <l>Yet raise thy drooping head; for I am come</l>
      <l>To chase away despair. Behold! where yonder</l>
      <l>That honest man, that faithful, brave, Dumont,</l>
      <l>Is hasting to thy aid—</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <l>Dumont! Ha! where?</l>
      <stage>(raising herself, and looking about.</stage>
      <l>Then heav'n has heard my pray'r; his very name</l>
      <l>Renews the springs of life, and cheers my soul.</l>
      <l>Has he then 'scap'd the snare?</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Belmour.</speaker>
      <l>He has; but see——</l>
      <l>He comes, unlike to that Dumont you knew,</l>
      <l>For now he wears your better angel's form,</l>
      <l>And comes to visit you with peace and pardon.</l>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter Dumont, C. from L.</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <l>Speak, tell me! Which is he? And oh! what would</l>
      <l>This dreadful vision! See it comes upon me—</l>
      <l>It is my husband——Ah!<stage>(she faints in Belmour's arms.</stage></l>
     </sp>
     <pb n="49"/>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <stage>(L.C.)</stage>
      <l>She faints! support her!</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Belmour.</speaker>
      <l>Her weakness could not bear the strong surprise.</l>
      <l>But see, she stirs! And the returning blood</l>
      <l>Faintly begins to blush again, and kindle</l>
      <l>Upon her ashy cheek—</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l>So—gently raise her—<stage>(raising her.</stage></l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <l>Ha! what art thou? Belmour!</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Belmour.</speaker>
      <l>How fare you, lady?</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <l>My heart is thrill'd with horror—</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Belmour.</speaker>
      <l>Be of courage—</l>
      <l>Your husband lives! 'tis he, my worthiest friend—</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <l>Still art thou there!—Still dost thou hover round me!</l>
      <l>Oh, save me, Belmour, from his angry shade!</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Belmour.</speaker>
      <l>'Tis he himself! he lives! look up—</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <l>I dare not!</l>
      <l>Oh! that my eyes could shut him out for ever—</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l>Am I so hateful then, so deadly to thee,</l>
      <l>To blast thy eyes with horror? Since I'm grown</l>
      <l>A burden to the world, myself, and thee,</l>
      <l>Would I had ne'er surviv'd to see thee more.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <l>Oh! thou most injur'd—dost thou live, indeed?</l>
      <l>Fall then, ye mountains, on my guilty head;</l>
      <l>Hide me, ye rocks, within your secret caverns;</l>
      <l>Cast thy black veil upon my shame, O night!</l>
      <l>And shield me with thy sable wing for ever.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l>Why dost thou turn away?——Why tremble thus?</l>
      <stage>(takes her hand)</stage>
      <l>Why thus indulge thy fears? and, in despair,</l>
      <l>Abandon thy distracted soul to horror?</l>
      <l>Cast every black and guilty thought behind thee,</l>
      <l>And let 'em never vex thy quiet more.</l>
      <l>My arms, my heart, are open to receive thee,</l>
      <l>To bring thee back to thy forsaken home,</l>
      <l>With tender joy, with fond forgiving love.</l>
      <l>Let us haste,</l>
      <l>Now while occasion seems to smile upon us,</l>
      <l>Forsake this place of shame, and find a shelter.</l>
     </sp>
     <stage>(they raise her,</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <l>What shall I say to you? But I obey—</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l>Lean on my arm——</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <l>Alas! I'm wondrous faint:</l>
      <l>But that's not strange, I have not eat these three days.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l>Oh! merciless!</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <l>Oh! I am sick at heart!——</l>
      <stage>(faints in Shore's arms.</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l>Thou murd'rous sorrow!</l>
      <l>Wilt thou still drink her blood, pursue her still?</l>
      <l>Must she then die? oh, my poor penitent!</l>
      <l>Speak peace to thy sad heart — she hears me not —</l>
      <l>Grief masters every sense—</l>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter Catesby, with a Guard, C. from L.U R..</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Cates.</speaker>
      <stage>(L. C.)</stage>
      <l>Seize on 'em both, as traitors to the state—</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Belmour.</speaker>
      <l>What means this violence?</l>
      <stage>(Guards advance to Shore and Belmour.</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Cates.</speaker>
      <l>Have we not found you,</l>
      <l>In scorn of the protector's strict command,</l>
      <l>Assisting this base woman, and abetting</l>
      <l>Her infamy?</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l>Infamy on thy head!</l>
      <l>Thou tool of power, thou pander to authority!</l>
      <l>I tell thee, knave, thou know'st of none so virtuous,</l>
      <l>And she that bore thee was an Ethiop to her.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Cates.</speaker>
      <l>You'll answer this at full—away with 'em.</l>
      <stage>(they seize Belmour and Dumont.</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l>Is charity grown treason to your court?</l>
      <l>What honest man would live beneath such rulers?</l>
      <l>I am content that we should die together——</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Cates.</speaker>
      <l>Convey the men to prison; but, for her,</l>
      <l>Leave her to hunt her fortune as she may.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <l>I will not part with him——for me!—for me!</l>
      <l>Oh! must he die for me?</l>
      <stage>Following him as he is dragged up—she falls, C.</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l>Inhuman villains!</l>
      <stage>Breaks from the Guards and returns to her.</stage>
      <l>Stand off! the agonies of death are on her——</l>
      <l>She pulls, she gripes me hard with her cold hand.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <l>Was this blow wanting to complete my ruin?</l>
      <l>Oh! let me go, ye ministers of terror.</l>
      <l>He shall offend no more, for I will die,</l>
      <pb n="51"/>
      <l>And yield obedience to your cruel master.</l>
      <l>Tarry a little, but a little longer,</l>
      <l>And take my last breath with you.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l>Oh, my love!</l>
      <l>Why dost thou fix thy dying eyes upon me,</l>
      <l>With such an earnest, such a piteous, look,</l>
      <l>As if thy heart were full of some sad meaning</l>
      <l>Thou couldst not speak?——</l>
      <stage>(kneeling by her)</stage>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <l>Forgive me!——but forgive me!</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Dumont.</speaker>
      <l>Be witness for me, ye celestial hosts,</l>
      <l>Such mercy and such pardon as my soul</l>
      <l>Accords to thee, and begs of heav'n to show thee;</l>
      <l>May such befall me at my latest hour,</l>
      <l>And make my portion blest or curst for ever.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
      <l>Then all is well, and I shall sleep in peace—</l>
      <l>'Tis very dark, and I have lost you now——</l>
      <l>Was there not something I would have bequeath'd you?</l>
      <l>But I have nothing left me to bestow,</l>

      <l>Nothing but one sad sigh. Oh! mercy, heav'n!</l>
     </sp>
     <stage>Plaintive music—she lifts her hands feebly in prayer, her head sinks, her hands fall,
      and she dies.</stage>
     <stage>Curtain slowly.</stage>
